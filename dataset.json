Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a highly reactive oxygen species and a strong oxidizer. Hydrogen peroxide is a component of a variety of chemicals industrially applied at large scale, such as suds or disinfectants. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced as a by-product of several biological processes such as the oxidative metabolization of sugar. Hydrogen peroxide also plays an important role in the immune system, in diseases such as asthma or cancer and as a signalling molecule in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, for example in the regulation of oxidative stress-related states. Therefore, there is a considerable interest in sensitive methods for detection or quantification of hydrogen peroxide, particularly in biological or environmental samples. A variety of methods for quantifying hydrogen peroxide exist. Among those, luminescence based methods are characterized by high sensitivities. A well-known example for such a luminescence based method is the Europium tetracycline (EuTc) assay, wherein the lanthanide europium is complexed with the antibiotic tetracycline. The luminescence of that complex increases with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration. One drawback of this assay is its sensitivity to compounds such as citrate and phosphate in submillimolar and low micromolar concentrations. These compounds increase the fluorescence intensity of the EuTc-complex and interfere with the increase in fluorescence caused by the EuTc\u2014H2O2 complex, rendering the assay inaccurate when applied to biological samples. Thus, it is the objective of the present invention to provide a sensitive and reliable method for the spectroscopic determination of hydrogen peroxide, which is particularly characterized by an increased stability against interfering compounds occurring in biological samples. According to a first aspect of the invention, a method for determining of an amount of a peroxide is provided, wherein the method comprises the steps of: providing a sample, contacting the sample with a lanthanide-ligand complex, and determining the luminescence of the lanthanide-ligand complex, characterized in that the lanthanide-ligand complex is a terbium(III) benzene dicarboxylic acid complex. The determination of an amount of a peroxide in the context of the present specification particularly refers to the measurement of a concentration of the peroxide, which can easily be converted to the molar\/mass amount in a given volume. The luminescence of the lanthanide-ligand complex changes in presence of the peroxide. The luminescence may be measured in terms of luminescence intensity or luminescence decay time. Both the intensity and decay time of the lanthanide ligand complex change in presence of the peroxide. The term \u201cluminescence\u201d in the context of the present specification refers to the emission of electromagnetic radiation by a substance not resulting from heat, particularly after excitation by electromagnetic radiation. Non-limiting examples for luminescence encompass fluorescence and phosphorescence. The sample can be any sample, for which the amount of the peroxide needs to be determined. The sample can for example be an environmental sample or a biological sample. In certain embodiments, the sample is a liquid. In certain embodiments, the liquid is aqueous. Non-limiting examples for an environmental sample are a sample from waters such as rivers, lakes or oceans, a waste sample, a sewage sample, a soil sample or an air sample. The peroxide in the sample to be determined may of any origin and may for example originate from biological, geological or industrial processes. An advantage of the method of the invention is an increased sensitivity of the method for the peroxide. The method provided herein particularly allows to decrease the lower limit of detection (LOD) and the lower limit of quantification (LOQ) to the sub-micromolar range. Another advantage is an increased insensitivity of the method of the invention against compounds known for their interference in luminescence assays, particularly in lanthanide based assays. Examples for such interfering compounds are citrate and phosphate. The method of the invention compares favourably to state of the art lanthanide based assays such as the EuTc-assay. Thus, the method of the invention is not disturbed by many salts and other serum components that interfere with the methods known in the art, and is compatible to human serum samples. As hydrogen peroxide is a byproduct of a number of enzymatic reactions, the method of the invention is also suitable for the detection of these enzymes and their underlying substrates. The determination of the luminescence may be performed in a suitable container that is permeable to the light emitted by the lanthanide-ligand complex of the invention, and particularly permeable for the light with which the lanthanide-ligand complex can be excited. Examples for such containers include, without being restricted to, microtiter plates, cuvettes, specimen slides and microfluidic chips transparent to light between 200 and 700 nm. In general, the term peroxide in the sense of the present invention particularly refers to a compound comprising a peroxo group (\u2014O\u2014O\u2014) or a peroxide anion (O22\u2212). Likewise, the amount of a compound that decomposes to a peroxide can be determined by the method of the invention, conducting the reaction for example in a protic solvent such as an aqueous solvent. The amount of the peroxide formed by the decomposing reaction can be quantified. A non-limiting example for such a decomposing compound is a compound comprising a superoxide (O2\u2212).

In some embodiments, the method of the invention is performed in an aqueous solvent. In some embodiments, the luminescence is determined at a wavelength above 470 nm. The luminescence may be determined with a photodiode or a photomultiplier, wherein for example the emitted light is filtered by a monochromator that allows only the light with the desired wavelength to pass.

EXAMPLES The assay of the example detects hydrogen peroxide in fluids such as water and serum samples. The assay is based on a phosphorescence signal of phthalic acid in complex with terbium ions, which decreases with increasing concentration of hydrogen peroxide. A certain ratio of phthalic acid to terbium in a suitable buffer is advantageous for an optimal performance of the assay. Suitable buffers are for example aqueous buffers such as HEPES, Tris- or imidazole buffer with a concentration between 50 and 100 mmol\/I. HEPES is a preferred buffer. This could be demonstrated for the determination of glucose by using glucose oxidase as a converting enzyme and for choline by using choline oxidase, both for water and serum samples. Other suitable enzymes are those belonging to EC (Enzyme Commission) number 1.11.1. Naturally, all substrates for those enzymes are also potential analytes for this assay. Example 1 Hydrogen Peroxide Determination in Aqueous Samples It could be shown that the best terbium\/phthalic acid ratio for optimal assay performance in presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide is 3:1 (FIG. 1). However, at a ratio of 2:1 (terbium\/phthalic acid) the difference in phosphorescence between presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide is even higher but the limit of detection is worse when compared to a ratio of 3:1. The assay of the invention becomes more sensitive with higher pH (FIG. 2). However, the linear range shifts with increasing pH (FIG. 3). The luminescence of lanthanide-ligand complex (terbium-phthalic acid) can be observed at a wavelength above 470 nm, particularly around 480 nm, around 542 nm, around 580 nm and around 620 nm (FIG. 4) while being excited with a wavelength of 250 nm to 300 nm (FIG. 5). The luminescence signal is relatively stable over a prolonged measurement period, whereby at pH 7.5 virtually no decrease of the signal intensity over a broad range of the hydrogen peroxide concentration can be observed (FIG. 6A). A small but significant decrease of the signal intensity over the time can be observed at higher pH value (FIGS. 6 B and C). The signal responses of the assay of the invention at different pH values are shown in FIG. 7 and the limits of detection and quantification are listed in the following table 1.

Then, 10 \u03bcL of solution A and 90 \u03bcl of solution B (lanthanide complex, 2.33 mmol\/L terbium, 0.77 mmol\/L phthalic acid in 80 mmol\/L HEPES buffer, pH 8.0) were added to a microtiter plate, mixed and incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes. After incubation the luminescence (phosphorescence) of the lanthanide ligand complex of the invention was measured at an emission wavelength 550 nm after excitation at 280 nm with a (time resolved) fluorescence plate reader. Example 3 Glucose Determination in Human Serum The assay of the invention can also be used for the enzymatic determination of substances which are converted with or to hydrogen peroxide, such as glucose that is converted by the glucose oxidase to glucono lactone and hydrogen peroxide. The determination of glucose was performed as following: 0.5 ml serum sample or water sample was diluted with 9.5 ml assay buffer yielding in solution A. Then, 10 \u03bcL of solution A, 85 \u03bcl of solution B (lanthanide complex, 2.33 mmol\/L terbium, 0.77 mmol\/L phthalic acid in 80 mmol\/L HEPES buffer, pH 8.0) and 5 \u03bcL of glucose oxidase solution (0.1 units in HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, 100 mmol\/L, wherein one unit will oxidize 1.0 \u03bcmol of \u03b2-D-glucose to D-gluconolactone and H2O2 per min at pH 5.1 at 35\u00b0 C., equivalent to an O2 uptake of 22.4 \u03bcL per min) were added to a microtiter plate, mixed and incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes. After incubation the luminescence (phosphorescence) of the lanthanide ligand complex of the invention was measured at an emission wavelength 550 nm after excitation at 280 nm with a (time resolved) fluorescence plate reader. If the reaction mixture is saturated with oxygen, the activity may increase by up to 100%. A fourfold improvement in sensitivity can be achieved by increasing the incubation time from 2 minutes to 10 minutes (FIG. 10). Example 4 Choline Determination in Human Serum Another application of the assay of the invention is the enzymatic determination of choline, which is converted by the choline oxidase to glycine betaine aldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The determination of choline was performed as following: 0.5 ml serum sample or water sample was diluted with 9.5 ml assay buffer yielding in solution A. Then, 10 \u03bcL of solution A, 45 \u03bcl of solution B (lanthanide complex, 2.33 mmol\/L terbium, 0.77 mmol\/L phthalic acid in 80 mmol\/L HEPES buffer, pH 8.0) and 45 \u03bcL of choline oxidase solution (0.9 units in HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, 100 mmol\/L, wherein one unit will form 1 \u03bcmol of H2O2 with oxidation of 1 \u03bcmol of choline to betaine aldehyde per min at pH 8.0 at 37\u00b0 C.) were added to a microtiter plate, mixed and incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes. After incubation the luminescence (phosphorescence) of the lanthanide ligand complex of the invention was measured at an emission wavelength 550 nm after excitation at 280 nm with a (time resolved) fluorescence plate reader. Note, that during the conversion of choline to betaine by choline oxidase, 2 \u03bcmol of H2O2 are produced for every \u03bcmol of choline. Here, an even twenty-fivefold improvement in sensitivity can be achieved by increasing the incubation time from 2 minutes to 10 minutes (FIG. 12).","cpc_label":"C12Q126","ipc_label":"C12Q126","filing_date":"20160101","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20161229","examiner_id":"73031.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention relates to a method for determining an amount of a peroxide, particularly hydrogen peroxide, by determining the luminescence of a lanthanide-ligand complex., in the context of the novelty:  The present invention relates to a method for determining an amount of a peroxide in a sample .

Unless indicated otherwise, the drawings provide exemplary embodiments or aspects of the disclosure and do not limit the scope of the disclosure. In the drawings: FIG. 1 is an illustrative image of an interface showing a patient's face with a grid comprising a symmetry line, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter; FIG. 2 shows a part of the image of FIG. 1, with a teeth model shown thereon, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter; FIG. 3 shows the image of FIG. 2, with some control points marked by a professional and a tooth outline, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter; FIG. 4 shows the image of FIG. 2, with a superimposed under-lips image of the teeth, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter; FIG. 5 shows the image of FIG. 4 with some taken measurements, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter; FIG. 6 shows a part of the image of FIG. 1, with a smile area indicated, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter; FIG. 7 shows the image of FIG. 1, with some additional facial measurements, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter; FIG. 8 is a flowchart showing steps in a method for designing body parts or operations thereon, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter; and FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing the components of an apparatus for designing body parts or operations thereon, in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The subject matter disclosed below refers to flowcharts and block diagrams describing methods, apparatus, system, or computer program products according to embodiments. It will be appreciated that parts of the block and flowcharts, and combinations of parts, can be implemented by computer program instructions. The computer program instructions may be provided to one or more processors of any computer such as a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, a processor, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions or steps specified in the flowcharts or one or more blocks of the block diagrams. These computer program instructions may be stored in a non-transient computer-readable medium that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the non-transient computer-readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the functions or acts or blocks specified in the flowchart or block diagram. The computer program instructions may be loaded onto a device, a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions, acts, or blocks specified in the flowchart or block diagram. One technical problem dealt with by the disclosed subject matter is the need to design the structure, size or shape of one or more teeth for a patient, whether for purposes of fixing and reshaping existing teeth, for example by polishing or adding parts, or for making false teeth, dental implants or dental crowns. The teeth should be of adequate size and shape, so as to match the patient's jaw and gum structure, taking into consideration also other teeth whether such exist or need to be designed as well, the patient's face, smile contour and other factors. The teeth should also be possible to manufacture and implant. For example, some parts thereof may have to comply with limitations such as minimum dimensions required for ensuring stability available, structures, or the like. Some of the information may be easily available, such as facial images which may be taken by any digital camera. Other information, such as information related to the existing teeth, the gums structure or the like, may be available from other sources, such as an intra-mouth image taken using a macro lens when the patient's mouth is widely open using an oral retractor. Manually designing and matching all the data, parameters, options and requirements is a labor-intensive job which requires a lot of measurements, size approximations, experience in selecting an adequate basic set of teeth and in adaptation planning, or the like. The manual designing and fitting process is also highly vulnerable to, mistakes which may require one or more amendment rounds, or which may lead to poor fitting of the teeth to the mouth, functional or aesthetical problems, and in general higher cost or higher inconvenience to the patient or the care giver. Yet another technical problem dealt with by the disclosed subject matter is the need to share information between multiple care givers. The information may include measures at particular areas, angles, locations, or the like. The measurements have to be taken very accurately, as well as expressed clearly to avoid misunderstandings. Yet another technical problem dealt with by the disclosed subject matter is the need to assess or predict what the designed teeth would look like once transplanted in the patient's mouth, or after a while. When a tooth is designed to fit into its intended location, it should also be compatible with the other teeth in size, color, shape, angle or other parameters. Even further, a dentist may be fond of the result while the patient may be unhappy for some reason such as a tooth size, tooth color or inconvenience. One technical solution relates to a method and apparatus for designing teeth for a patient. In some exemplary embodiments, the method comprises presenting to a user, such as a dentist, a technician, an aesthetician or any other professional or even the patient, an image that shows the relevant body part such as the mouth, preferably with its surrounding. For example, a picture of the patient's face may be displayed. If the goal is to design teeth, the picture may be taken when the patient's mouth is open, for example when the patient is smiling. The image may be rotated so as to straighten it around a vertical axis, and one or more lines may be defined on the image, such as a symmetry line, and one or more horizontal or vertical lines which may generate a grid. The professional may then select an image or model of the relevant part, for example a teeth set. The teeth set may be selected from a collection of teeth sets. The professional may select the set that seems to provide the best match to the teeth of the patient. The professional may select which parts the set will include. For example, when designing one tooth, the professional may select a set comprising all teeth, and leave out all teeth but five which include the tooth to be designed and two teeth on either side. The model may be resized as required and placed in the appropriate location on the image, for example the face image. The model may be a wire-frame model with transparent or semi-transparent such that the patient's features such as the teeth may be seen under the model. Alternatively, the model may be a three dimensional model in which the projection is displayed as a collection of one or more contours. The professional may change the outline of each tooth as displayed on the image, to match it as required, for example by moving, adding or deleting control points. In order to keep smooth lines, the tooth outline may be automatically manipulated to represent a Bezier curve, or it may be manually manipulated by the professional. In some embodiments, when designing a tooth, the symmetrical tooth may be automatically manipulated to be symmetric to the designed tooth. However such symmetry may be avoided if required. Designing one or more teeth may include changing their size, location along the gum, vertical location, or rotation angle. Designing many also include changing the tooth's shape in any required manner. It will be understood that changing control points or otherwise manipulating the teeth is a design phase which relates to image manipulations, and does not imply changes to actual teeth, unless further actions are taken as described below. In some embodiments, a different image may be placed on the first image which may provide different information on the same body part. For example, an image of the teeth may be taken using a close-up of the mouth with a macro lens, wherein the patient's mouth may be wide open using an oral retractor, such that the teeth are better exposed, and under-lip view is enabled. Such image may also be resized and placed in the relevant location over the first image. In the example of teeth designing, the mouth image may be placed over the facial image such that a detailed view of the teeth under the lips is shown in the overall context, e.g., as part of the full face. The professional may take different measures of the face and\/or teeth, gums or the like as part of designing the body part such as the teeth. The professional may also take measures of designed teeth, for example height at a particular area, width, angle, or the like. In some embodiments, the professional may mark certain areas on the first or the second image, for example the contour of the patient's smile, in order to improve the design, for example make sure a desired part of the teeth is seen when the person is smiling, but the gums are generally covered. In some embodiments, areas such as the smile contour may be determined automatically, for example using edge detection techniques for the facial image. When the professional has completed the design, or even before that, the professional may store the design, for example the control points, the Bezier curve, the outline of the teeth or the image of the designed teeth, with or without any of the displayed images. The professional may also take measures of the designed areas such as the designed teeth, and may store them together with the designed teeth. It will be appreciated that although the examples above relate to teeth, the disclosure is not limited to teeth and may be used for designing other parts such as the nose or eyes area before a surgery. The system and method may be used for planning aesthetic as well as functional operations. One technical effect of the disclosed subject matter relates to providing an easy, intuitive and efficient apparatus for designing operations such as aesthetical surgeries, or designing parts such as teeth. The method and apparatus provide for identifying, measuring or evaluating the clinical patient parameters, such that the design may take thee parameters into account. The method and apparatus provide for combining data from multiple sources such as different types of images, and superimposing them to achieve better results. For example, making sure that the designed teeth are compatible with the gums size and structure, as seen in the intra-mouth image, while being compatible with the face as a whole, the smile, or other factors. The system and method provide for selecting from multiple predetermined sets of teeth or other parts, to be used as a basis for design. Thus, the disclosed method and apparatus provide for diagnosing conditions, identifying risks and predicting the treatment outcomes in an efficient and effective manner. Another technical effect of the disclosed subject matter relates to communicating and sharing the design among multiple professionals. For example, after a dentist designed one or more teeth, a root canal specialist or a technician may review or enhance the design. Even further, a technician or a laboratory may receive the design for molding or otherwise creating one or more false teeth or dental crowns as designed. Yet another technical effect of the disclosed subject matter relates to sharing the design with the patient, by showing the patient what the body part is expected to look like when transplanted or operated. In some embodiments, the expected look is the final result that will be assumed after the initial swelling or other side effects disappear, and the tooth assumes its final position. Referring now to FIGS. 1-7, showing a user interface of an apparatus for designing teeth for a patient. A user of the apparatus may be a professional such as a dentist, a teeth technician, or the like. Referring now to FIG. 1, showing a main image area 104 displaying a frontal image of a patient. The patient is smiling so that her teeth are visible. However, it will be appreciated that the way the patient's picture is taken depends on the purpose: for teeth designing it may be preferable that the patient's mouth is open, while in nose surgery planning this may not be required. Area 108 on the right hand side of the user interface shows smaller images from which the user can choose which image to show in area 104. Area 112 shows a small version of the image displayed in area 104. Area 112 always shows the full image, on which the zoomed-in part as shown in area 104 is marked, to provide the user with orientation of which part of the full image is currently displayed in area 104. The image in area 014 has thereon a symmetry line 116 and additional lines constituting a grid. Referring now to FIG. 2, showing area 104 with a zoom-in on the mouth of the patient shown in area 104 of FIG. 1. The shown part is indicated by a rectangle drawn around the mouth area on the image shown in area 112. Also shown in area 104 is an image 204 of a teeth model, which may have been selected by the user from a multiplicity of models. Image 204 may have been moved, rotated, or resized to fit the size and location of the patient's teeth as displayed. The model may be displayed in a semi-transparent manner so that the patient's teeth are also visible, such that the model may be adapted for the specific patient. Also shown is a legend 208 from which the user may select which teeth should be part of the model. For example, if a person has a certain tooth and it is not planned to reconstruct that tooth, then the tooth may be unchecked and not be part of the model. The user may also select or change additional parameters. Referring now to FIG. 3, showing markers 304 as indicated by the user on tooth 300, in order to design its boundary. The boundary may be designed according to the existing tooth as seen through the model image, to fill missing parts of the existing tooth, to create a brand new false tooth or dental crown in accordance with an existing symmetrical tooth, or the like. Symmetrical tooth 308 may be marked with a curved contour 312, determined according to points 304 indicated on the symmetrical tooth. The contour may be determined as a Bezier curve or any other preferably smooth curve connecting control points 304 or the symmetrical points. Referring now to FIG. 4, showing the mouth area of the patient shown in area 104 of FIG. 1, with an additional image 400 which may have been taken by a macro lens when the patient's mouth is opened using an oral retractor. Image 400 shows also the teeth parts behind the lips, and thus provides a fuller image of the teeth. Image 400 may be adjusted in size and location to the patient's image and superimposed thereon. Image 400 may hide the relevant area of the patient's image, or may be transparent to some degree. Model 300 may still be shown to facilitate designing the teeth in view of image 400. It will be appreciated that image 400 may be laid over only part of the patient's image, such that other parts for example chin 404 or other areas are visible (although these parts, for example the patient's eyes, may be out of the field of view is changed), in order to provide an overall view of the teeth within the context of the face. Referring now to FIG. 5, showing image 400 together with the teeth model, and with some indications thereon, such as the measurements showing required dimensions of the designed tooth. Referring now to FIG. 6, showing a part of image area 104 with control points 600 and curve 604, which indicates the smile area of the patient. Marking the smile area enables to design the teeth so that they are aesthetically compliant with the smiles, for example a portion of the teeth is visible when the person smiles but the gums are hidden. It will be appreciated that control points 600 and curve 604 may mark other parts or effects in a patient's face or body, and not necessarily the smile area. Referring now to FIG. 7, showing a significant part of the patient's image, with different measurements, such as different distances, angles, or the like. Determining the measurements may provide for better adjustment of teeth parameters, such as teeth angles, sizes, or the like. Referring now to FIG. 8, showing a flowchart of steps in a method for designing a body part such as teeth or an operation on a body part. On step 800 an image of the body part of the patient may be displayed on a display device. The image may show the patient in full, or a part thereof such as a facial image. In some embodiments, such as dental applications, the first image may be an image of the patient's face, with the patient smiling so that the patient's teeth are visible. On step 804, a second image of the patient may be displayed, wherein the second image may have different characteristic, such as being partial to the first image, being taken with different equipment such as a different lens, being taken with special handling of the body part. For example in the dental application, the second image may be taken by a macro lens with the patient's mouth opened with an oral retractor. The second image may be displayed on top of the first image, after having been resized, rotated, moved or otherwise adapted. The top image may be displayed with a degree of transparency so that the bottom image is also visible. On step 808, an image of a model of the body part to be designed or to be operated on may be displayed. The model may be selected from multiple models according to a user's choice, and may be replaced if the user feels it is suboptimal. The model image may include feature indications and outlines, such as control points, teeth outlines, or other indicators. The model may be configured, for example indicated to comprise only some teeth, in accordance with the design task. The model image may be displayed such that only the contours are visible, while internal areas are transparent, such that the body part can be best adapted in accordance with the first and the second images which may be visible in addition to the model image. The model or any part thereof may be moved, rotated, resized or otherwise manipulated to fit the first or the second images as displayed on the display device. It will be appreciated that the first image, the second image and the model image may be displayed in any desired temporal order (e.g. any image or model may be displayed prior to or after another one), and in any vertical order (e.g., any image or model may be displayed above or below any other one such that it may fully or partially hide or expose it). On step 812, user indications related to the model may be received, such as size measurements, control point marking, or other indications. The user may also mark which parts of the model are required, for example selecting only some teeth from a model comprising a full set of teeth. On step 816, additional manipulations may be performed, such as determining a curve based on points marked on the model image. Manipulations may also include manipulations to other teeth in the model. For example, in response to the user marking control points on one tooth, adding a curve line connecting corresponding control points on a symmetrical tooth. On optional step 820 the model may be validated. Such validation may include professional validation, for example adherence with medical standards and principles such as tooth structure and strength, administrative principles, such as verifying that the patient approved the output before manufacturing, or the like. Additional validation may relate to color selection, for example verifying that color match between a new tooth and existing ones was determined according to at least a predetermined number of images taken under different lightning conditions. On optional step 824 the model may be output, for example to a file, a printer, a plotter, another display, a manufacturing device, or the like. In some embodiments, the model may be output to a laboratory or a machine for molding or otherwise generating objects to be used as one or more false teeth or dental crowns in accordance with the model. On optional step 828 the model may be shared with another professional or institute such as a technician, a laboratory or another expert.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS For better explaining the technical solution and the effect of the present invention, the present invention will be further described in detail with the accompanying drawings in the specific embodiments. Please refer to FIG. 1. FIG. 1 is a structure diagram of a 3D printer provided by the present invention. The 3D printer according to the embodiment of the present invention comprises a printing chamber 1, and the printing chamber 1 comprises a printing assembly 2 and a loading platform 3 inside, and the printing assembly 2 is located above the loading platform 3, and the printing assembly 2 comprises a printing support 21 and a printing head assembly 22 and a curing lamp assembly 24 connected on the printing support 21. For convenience, the printing direction of the 3D printer of this embodiment is defined to be the X direction shown in FIG. 1. In other words, the printing assembly 2 proceeds printing motion along the X direction. Specifically, the printing support 21 of the printing assembly 2 is moved along the X direction, and in the X direction, the printing head assembly 22 is in front of the curing lamp assembly 24. The printing head assembly 22 comprises a main printing head 221 of printing a model mainbody 4 and a sub printing head 222 of printing support material 5, and material of the model mainbody 4 is photosensitive resin, and a printing temperature inside the printing chamber 1 is lower than a solidification temperature of the support material 5, and the support material 5 is solidified at the printing temperature. In the 3D printer according to the embodiment of the present invention, the model mainbody 4 is printed by the main printing head 221, and the material of the model mainbody 4 is photosensitive resin, and the model mainbody 4 is solidified under irradiation of the curing lamp assembly 24; the support material 5 is printed by the sub printing head 222, and the support material 5 is printed at the position adjacent to the model mainbody 4 or the hanging position, and is solidified at the printing temperature lower than the solidification temperature of the support material 5 for supporting and fixing the model mainbody 4. In the 3D printer of this embodiment, the support material 5 can be solidified after being printed by controlling the printing temperature in the printing chamber 1, and thus to realize the fixture and support to the model mainbody 4. The entire process is simple and highly efficient, and is beneficial for promoting the printing efficiency of the 3D printer. Meanwhile, only needed is to take out the model from the 3D printer, and put the same in an environment of which the temperature is higher than the solidification temperature of the support material 5, the support material 5 will spontaneously melt. The remove procedure of the support material 5 is fast and simple, and will not cause damage to the model mainbody 4. The printing quality of the model mainbody 4 can be ensured. Furthermore, with utilizing water to be the support material, compared with the support material cost of prior art which is about 700-100 RMB\/kg, the cost of this embodiment in which water is utilized to be the support material is extremely low and environmentally friendly, and can be recycled. Then, the printing temperature in the printing chamber 1 is set to be lower than 0\u00b0 C. Certainly, only needed is to take out the printing accomplished model from the 3D printer of the present embodiment, and put the same in an environment of which the temperature is higher than 0\u00b0 C., the support material of water will spontaneously melt. The remove procedure of the support material is fast and simple, and will not cause damage to the model mainbody. The printing quality of the model mainbody can be ensured. It is understandable that the printing temperature inside the printing chamber 1 can be maintained by the wind circulation system. The Cooling source of the wind circulation system can be an external refrigeration system or an auxiliary system of the 3D printer. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 1, the printing assembly 2 of the 3D printer further comprises a flattening assembly 23 connected on the printing support 21, and the flattening assembly 23 is positioned between the printing head assembly 22 and the curing lamp assembly 24. In the printing procedure, first, the printing assembly 2 prints the photosensitive resin and the support material, and then the flattening assembly 23 presses the photosensitive resin and the support material with a setting thickness, and finally, the curing lamp assembly 24 solidifies the photosensitive resin to accomplish one printing. Please refer to FIG. 2. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the flattening assembly 23 comprises a flattening roller 231 and a supporting frame 232 connected to the flattening roller 231 and the printing support 21. The flattening roller 231 rolls and flattens the photosensitive resin 4 and the support material 5. The motion is slow and the forward resistance is small. Moreover, an interior of the flattening roller 231 and an interior of the supporting frame 232 are hollow and communicate with each other, and the interior of the flattening roller 231 and the interior of the supporting frame 232 are filled with cooling material of which a temperature is lower than the solidification temperature. As an illustration, the cooling material also can flow in the interior of the flattening roller 231 and the interior of the supporting frame 232. The flowing direction is indicated by the arrow shown in FIG. 2. The flattening surface of the flattening roller 231 is in a low temperature state which is lower than the solidification temperature of the support material. The flattening roller 231 can promote the solidification of the support material as flattening the support material, and can assure the support strength of the support material. Here, the flattening surface is the outer surface of the flattening roller 231, i.e. the contact surface of the flattening roller 231 with the photosensitive resin and the support material. It is understandable that when the support material utilizes water to be material, the cooling material can be gas or liquid of \u22123\u00b0 C. to \u22127\u00b0 C., and preferably of \u22125\u00b0 C. Because flattening surface of the flattening roller 231 is in a low temperature state which is lower than 0\u00b0 C. The flattening roller 231 can solidify the water into ice in advance as flattening the water, and can assure the support strength of the support material which utilizes the water in this embodiment. Furthermore, the sub printing head 222 of the 3D printer according to the embodiment of the present invention comprises a temperature control device of controlling the support material in the sub printing head 222 to remain to be liquid for preventing the support material from being solidified at the mouth of the sub printing head 222 to form the output barrier of the sub printing head 222. It is understandable that when the support material utilizes water to be material, the temperature control device controls the temperature of the water in the sub printing head 222 to not to be lower than 0\u00b0 C. for preventing the water from being solidified at the mouth of the sub printing head 222 to form the output barrier of the sub printing head 222. AS shown in FIG. 1, in the printing direction, the main printing head 221 of the printing assembly 2 is in front of the sub printing head 222. Furthermore, the printing assembly 2 comprises a printing control system. In the moving and printing process of the printing assembly 2, the printing control system can detect the positions of the main printing head 221 and the sub printing head 222, and independently controls the output operation of the main printing head 221 and the sub printing head 222 or stops the output operation. Please refer to FIG. 3. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the printing assembly 2 of the 3D printer further comprises a switch head 223, and the switch head 223 connects the main printing head 221 and the sub printing head 222 to the printing support 21, and switches positions of the main printing head 221 and the sub printing head 222. Furthermore, the printing assembly 2 of this embodiment comprises a printing control system. In the moving and printing process of the printing assembly 2, the printing control system can detect the positions of the printing assembly 2, and controls the switch head 223 to switch the positions of the main printing head 221 and the sub printing head 222 (namely, it determines whether the photosensitive resin 4 or the water 5 is required according to the printing position of the printing assembly 2, and then rotates the main printing head 221 or the sub printing head 222 to the printing position, and rotates the other printing head out of the printing position). Meanwhile, it can independently control the output operation of the main printing head 221 and the sub printing head 222 or stop the output operation. Furthermore, the curing lamp assembly 24 of the 3D printer described in the embodiment of the present invention comprises a LED ultraviolet light source. The heat generated by the LED ultraviolet light source is small, and the lifetime is long, and the volume is small. The installation position in the 3D printer can be flexibly adjusted and the influence to the printing temperature inside the printing chamber 1 is small. Moreover, a spotlight device can be added on the LED ultraviolet light source. Thereby, the irradiation position of the light can be controlled more accurately to achieve the printing and curing effect in the 3D printing process. Moreover, the loading platform 3 of the 3D printer described in the embodiment of the present invention comprises a low temperature assembly, and the low temperature assembly controls a temperature of a loading surface of the loading platform 3 to be lower than the solidification temperature of the support material. It ensures that the support material which utilizes the water and contacts with the loading surface will not melt. Here, the loading surface is the contact surface of the loading platform 3 with the photosensitive resin and the support material. It is understandable that when the support material utilizes water to be material, the temperature of the loading surface is lower than 0\u00b0 C. The embodiment of the present invention further provides a 3D printing method, which utilizes the 3D printer described in the aforesaid embodiments for printing, comprising the printing steps of: printing the photosensitive resin and the support material in the printing chamber to form a model, and the photosensitive resin forms the model mainbody under irradiation of the curing lamp assembly, and the support material is solidified and supports the model mainbody at the printing temperature lower than the solidification temperature of the support material; taking out the model, and removing the support material in an environment of which a temperature is higher than the solidification temperature of the support material. In the 3D printer of this embodiment, the support material can be solidified after being printed by controlling the printing temperature in the printing chamber, and thus to realize the fixture and support to the model mainbody. The entire process is simple and highly efficient, and is beneficial for promoting the printing efficiency. Meanwhile, only needed is to take out the model from the 3D printer, and put the same in an environment of which the temperature is higher than the solidification temperature of the support material, the support material will spontaneously melt. The remove procedure of the support material is fast and simple, and will not cause damage to the model mainbody. The printing quality of the model mainbody can be ensured.

The ASO has a function of controlling information transfer from a gene into protein by changing an intermediate metabolism of mRNA through single-stranded RNA or DNA strand, which is to achieve desired expression control of target protein by selecting base sequences that are sufficiently complementary and specifically hybridized. The ASO is sequence-specifically bonded to a target gene, which does not have an effect on expression of other genes other than the target gene. Therefore, the ASO technology is a tool that is useful for analysis of functions in vivo of the specific protein, and has a possibility of being utilized as a gene therapy with respect to specific diseases (FASEBJ. 9, 1288-1296, 1995). miRNA (microRNA) is small RNA of a large group that is naturally produced in a subject, and at least some of them control the expression of the target gene. The miRNA is formed from approximately 70 nucleotide single-stranded hairpin precursor transcriptomes by ribonuclease dicer (Ambros et al. 2003. current biology 13(10):807-818), wherein the dicer cuts the precursor to form 21-23 nucleotide double-stranded miRNAs. In many cases, the miRNA is transcribed from some of DNA sequences of which functions have not been found yet. The miRNA is not translated into protein, but rather, the miRNAs are combined with the specific mRNAs that block the translation. It is though that the miRNAs incorrectly form base pairs with targets thereof to inhibit the translation. Since a role of the RNAi had been found, it was found that the RNAi sequence-sequentially functions to mRNA in various kinds of mammalian cells (Silence of the transcripts: RNA interference in medicine. J Mol Med, 2005, 83: 764-773). When a long chain of double-stranded RNA is delivered to a cell, the delivered double-stranded RNA is converted into a small interfering RNA (hereinafter, referred to as \u2018siRNA\u2019) which is processed to 21 to 23 base pairs (bp) by an endonuclease called a Dicer. siRNA has a short chain of double-stranded RNA having 19 to 27 bases and is coupled to an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whereby a guide (antisense) strand recognizes and decomposes a target mRNA to sequence-specifically inhibit the expression of the target gene (Nucleic-acid therapeutics: basic principles and recent applications. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. 2002. 1, 503-514). In particular, the long-chain of double-stranded RNA delivered from the outside has a problem of excessively causing a non-sequence-specific immune reaction through interferon expression in a mammal cell; however, it is found that the problem may be overcome by a short-stranded siRNA (Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells. Nature. 2001. 411, 494-498). However, siRNA also has a possibility of innate immune response stimulation generated through sensors present in cells, and accordingly, in order to overcome the possibility, the specific structure of the siRNA is changed or 2-methoxy substituents or 2-fluoro substituents have been developed. A chemically synthesized siRNA has a double-stranded of about 19 to 27 base pairs (bps) and has a 2-nt(nucleotide) overhang structure at 3\u2032-end, and in order that the double-stranded siRNA expresses an activity, it is known that the double-stranded siRNA has a structure consisting of 3\u2032-hydroxyl group (OH) and 5\u2032-phosphate group (PO 4 ) (Effect of asymmetric terminal structures of short RNA duplexes on the RNA interference activity and strand selection. Nucleic Acids Res 1 Oct. 2008:5812-5821). It is known that a commercialized and synthesized siRNA has a structure in which hydroxyl groups are present at both ends, and when the synthesized siRNA is delivered to a cell, siRNA 5\u2033-end is phosphorylated by a phosphorylation kinase to express functions of siRNA (siRNA function in RNAi: A chemical modification analysis. RNA 2003. 9: 1034-1048). Bertrand et al., found that as compared to an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) on the same target gene, siRNA has an effect of significantly inhibiting mRNA expression in vitro and in vivo, and the corresponding effect is maintained for a long time (Comparison of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs in cell culture and in vivo. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002. 296: 1000-1004). In addition, since siRNA is complementarily coupled to a target mRNA to sequence-specifically regulate the expression of the target gene, a mechanism of the siRNA has an advantage that a target to be capable of being applied may be remarkably increased as compared to the existing antibody-based medical product or small molecular drug. (Progress Towards in Vivo Use of siRNAs. MOLECULAR THERAPY. 2006 13(4):664-670). Even if an oligonucleotide (siRNA, etc)-based therapeutic agent has excellent effect and variously usable range, in order to develop the siRNA as a therapeutic agent, the siRNA is required to be effectively delivered to the target cell by improving stability of siRNA and a cell delivery efficiency of siRNA (Harnessing in vivo siRNA delivery for drug discovery and therapeutic development. Drug Discov Today. 2006 January; 11(1-2):67-73). In particular, since the oligonucleotides such as siRNA, etc., are not passed through a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer of a cell due to negative charges thereof, it is difficult to be delivered in the cell through a simple diffusion. In order to increase a delivery efficiency of the oligonucleotides in vivo or in vitro, various kinds of cell delivery materials have been developed. Liposomes, cationic surfactants, etc., are generally and largely used. Further, methods of using a carrier such as a method of fusing a gene in liposome, a method of using a cationic lipid or a cationic polymer, etc., a method of changing a chemical structure, that is, changing a combined basic structure of oligonucleotide to methylphosphonate, peptide nucleic acid (PNA), etc., and a method of using a conjugate have been known (Chemically modified siRNA: tools and applications. Drug Discov Today. 2008 October; 13(19-20):842-855; Mechanisms and strategies for effective delivery of antisense and siRNA oligonucleotides. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 July; 36(12):4158-71). Among them, a method of using a nanocarrier, that is, a method of using various polymers such as liposome, cationic polymer composite, etc., is to capture oligonucleotides in a nanocarrier by forming nanoparticles to deliver the captured oligonucleotides to cells. Among the methods of using the nanocarrier, a method of using polymeric nanoparticle, polymer micelle, lipoplex, or the like, is mainly used, wherein the lipoplex consists of cationic lipid to interact with anionic lipid of endosome of a cell, thereby inducing a destabilization effect of the endosome to deliver the siRNA into a cell (Mechanism of oligonucleotide release from cationic liposomes. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996 Oct. 15; 93(21):11493-8). In particular, it is known that when the oligonucleotide is siRNA, chemical materials, etc., are connected to end portions of a siRNA passenger (sense) strand to provide increased pharmacokinetics characteristics, such that high efficiency may be induced in vivo (Therapeutic silencing of an endogenous gene by systemic administration of modified siRNAs. Nature. 2004 Nov. 11; 432(7014):173-8). Here, stability of the siRNA may vary depending on properties of the chemical materials bonded to ends of the siRNA sense (passenger) or antisense (guide) strand. For example, an siRNA to which a polymer compound such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) is conjugated, interacts with an anionic phosphate group of siRNA in the presence of cationic materials to form a complex, thereby being a carrier having an improved siRNA stability (Local and systemic delivery of VEGF siRNA using polyelectrolyte complex micelles for effective treatment of cancer. J Control Release. 2008 Jul. 14; 129(2):107-16). In particular, micelle consisting of polymer complexes has an extremely small size, significantly uniform distribution, and is spontaneously form, thereby being easy to manage quality of formulation and secure reproducibility, as compared to other systems used as a drug delivery vehicle, such as microsphere, nanoparticle, etc. Further, in order to improve an intracellular delivery efficiency of siRNA, technology of using a siRNA conjugate in which hydrophilic material which is a biocompatible polymer (for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG)) is conjugated to the siRNA by a simple covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond, to thereby secure stability of siRNA and have effective cell membrane permeability was developed (see Korean Patent Publication No. 883471). However, the chemical modification of the siRNA and the conjugation with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PEGylation) still has disadvantages that stability in a living body is low and delivery into a target tissue is not smooth. In order to solve the disadvantages, a structure comprising double-stranded oligo RNA (\u2018double-stranded oligo RNA structure\u2019) in which a hydrophilic material and a hydrophobic material are bonded to oligonucleotides, in particular, double-stranded oligo RNA such as siRNA, was developed, wherein the double-stranded oligo RNA structure forms a self assembled nanoparticle named a self assembled micelle inhibitory RNA (SAMiRNA\u2122) by a hydrophobic interaction of a hydrophobic material (see Korean Patent Publication No. 1224828), the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology has an advantage in that homogenous nanoparticles having a significantly small size are capable of being obtained as compared to the existing delivery technologies. As a specific example of the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology, PEG (polyethylene glycol) is used as a hydrophilic material, wherein PEG is synthetic polymer, which is used for increasing solubility of pharmaceuticals, particularly, protein, and for controlling pharmacokinetics. PEG is a polydisperse material as like all synthetic polymers, a polymer in one batch consists of the sum of different number of monomers, a molecular weight is shown in the Gaussian curve, and polydispersity index (Mw\/Mn) expresses the homogeneity degree of a material. That is, when PEG has a low molecular weight (3 to 5 kDa), the polydisperse index is about 1.01, and when PEG has a high molecular weight (20 kDa), the polydisperse index is about 1.2 which is high, such that as the molecular weight is higher, the homogeneity of the material is relatively low (F. M. Veronese. Peptide and protein PEGylation: a review of problems and solutions. Biomaterials (2001) 22:405-417). Accordingly, when the PEG is bonded to the pharmaceuticals, polydispersity characteristic of PEG is reflected on the conjugate, such that it is difficult to verify a single material. Recently, in order to overcome the problem, production of materials having a low polydispersity index by synthesizing PEG and improving purification processes is on a rising trend, but has still problems due to polydispersity characteristic of the material, particularly, when PEG is bonded to a material having a small molecular weight, there is difficulty in confirming whether or not the binding is easily performed, etc. (Francesco M. Veronese and Gianfranco Pasut. PEGylation, successful approach to drug delivery. DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY (2005) 10(21):1451-1458). Further, the size of nanoparticles significantly affects the deliver efficiency into the target cell, when the size of nanoparticles is 50 nm or less, the nanoparticles are rapidly removed from the body via excretion, and when the size of nanoparticles is 100 nm or more, the nanoparticles are not evenly delivered into the tissue, and the effect is reduced. Therefore, it is required to form nanoparticles each having a predetermined size (Wim H De Jong and Paul J A Borm. Int J Nanomedicine. 2008 June; 3(2): 133-149.). Therefore, the market on a novel concept of oligonucleotide delivery technique for solving polydispersity characteristic of hydrophilic materials such as PEG, etc., of themselves while maintaining the excellent effects of SAMiRNA\u2122 according to the related art as they are, has been urgently demanded.","summary":"<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a nano-particle formed of oligonucleotide structures to which hydrophilic materials each having the same molecular weight are bonded according to the present invention.

In addition, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition including the oligonucleotide structure, a method for preparing the oligonucleotide structure, and a technology for delivering oligonucleotide using the oligonucleotide structure. BACKGROUND ART Various types of therapeutic agents based on oligonucleotides such as antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), RNA interference (hereinafter, referred to as \u2018RNAi\u2019), microRNA (miRNA), etc., have been actively developed at present. The ASO has a function of controlling information transfer from a gene into protein by changing an intermediate metabolism of mRNA through single-stranded RNA or DNA strand, which is to achieve desired expression control of target protein by selecting base sequences that are sufficiently complementary and specifically hybridized. The ASO is sequence-specifically bonded to a target gene, which does not have an effect on expression of other genes other than the target gene. Therefore, the ASO technology is a tool that is useful for analysis of functions in vivo of the specific protein, and has a possibility of being utilized as a gene therapy with respect to specific diseases (FASEBJ. 9, 1288-1296, 1995). miRNA (microRNA) is small RNA of a large group that is naturally produced in a subject, and at least some of them control the expression of the target gene. The miRNA is formed from approximately 70 nucleotide single-stranded hairpin precursor transcriptomes by ribonuclease dicer (Ambros et al. 2003. current biology 13(10):807-818), wherein the dicer cuts the precursor to form 21-23 nucleotide double-stranded miRNAs. In many cases, the miRNA is transcribed from some of DNA sequences of which functions have not been found yet. The miRNA is not translated into protein, but rather, the miRNAs are combined with the specific mRNAs that block the translation. It is though that the miRNAs incorrectly form base pairs with targets thereof to inhibit the translation. Since a role of the RNAi had been found, it was found that the RNAi sequence-sequentially functions to mRNA in various kinds of mammalian cells (Silence of the transcripts: RNA interference in medicine. J Mol Med, 2005, 83: 764-773). When a long chain of double-stranded RNA is delivered to a cell, the delivered double-stranded RNA is converted into a small interfering RNA (hereinafter, referred to as \u2018siRNA\u2019) which is processed to 21 to 23 base pairs (bp) by an endonuclease called a Dicer. siRNA has a short chain of double-stranded RNA having 19 to 27 bases and is coupled to an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whereby a guide (antisense) strand recognizes and decomposes a target mRNA to sequence-specifically inhibit the expression of the target gene (Nucleic-acid therapeutics: basic principles and recent applications. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. 2002. 1, 503-514). In particular, the long-chain of double-stranded RNA delivered from the outside has a problem of excessively causing a non-sequence-specific immune reaction through interferon expression in a mammal cell; however, it is found that the problem may be overcome by a short-stranded siRNA (Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells. Nature. 2001. 411, 494-498). However, siRNA also has a possibility of innate immune response stimulation generated through sensors present in cells, and accordingly, in order to overcome the possibility, the specific structure of the siRNA is changed or 2-methoxy substituents or 2-fluoro substituents have been developed. A chemically synthesized siRNA has a double-stranded of about 19 to 27 base pairs (bps) and has a 2-nt(nucleotide) overhang structure at 3\u2032-end, and in order that the double-stranded siRNA expresses an activity, it is known that the double-stranded siRNA has a structure consisting of 3\u2032-hydroxyl group (OH) and 5\u2032-phosphate group (PO4) (Effect of asymmetric terminal structures of short RNA duplexes on the RNA interference activity and strand selection. Nucleic Acids Res 1 Oct. 2008:5812-5821). It is known that a commercialized and synthesized siRNA has a structure in which hydroxyl groups are present at both ends, and when the synthesized siRNA is delivered to a cell, siRNA 5\u2033-end is phosphorylated by a phosphorylation kinase to express functions of siRNA (siRNA function in RNAi: A chemical modification analysis. RNA 2003. 9: 1034-1048). Bertrand et al., found that as compared to an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) on the same target gene, siRNA has an effect of significantly inhibiting mRNA expression in vitro and in vivo, and the corresponding effect is maintained for a long time (Comparison of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs in cell culture and in vivo. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002. 296: 1000-1004). In addition, since siRNA is complementarily coupled to a target mRNA to sequence-specifically regulate the expression of the target gene, a mechanism of the siRNA has an advantage that a target to be capable of being applied may be remarkably increased as compared to the existing antibody-based medical product or small molecular drug. (Progress Towards in Vivo Use of siRNAs. MOLECULAR THERAPY. 2006 13(4):664-670). Even if an oligonucleotide (siRNA, etc)-based therapeutic agent has excellent effect and variously usable range, in order to develop the siRNA as a therapeutic agent, the siRNA is required to be effectively delivered to the target cell by improving stability of siRNA and a cell delivery efficiency of siRNA (Harnessing in vivo siRNA delivery for drug discovery and therapeutic development. Drug Discov Today. 2006 January; 11(1-2):67-73). In particular, since the oligonucleotides such as siRNA, etc., are not passed through a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer of a cell due to negative charges thereof, it is difficult to be delivered in the cell through a simple diffusion. In order to increase a delivery efficiency of the oligonucleotides in vivo or in vitro, various kinds of cell delivery materials have been developed. Liposomes, cationic surfactants, etc., are generally and largely used. Further, methods of using a carrier such as a method of fusing a gene in liposome, a method of using a cationic lipid or a cationic polymer, etc., a method of changing a chemical structure, that is, changing a combined basic structure of oligonucleotide to methylphosphonate, peptide nucleic acid (PNA), etc., and a method of using a conjugate have been known (Chemically modified siRNA: tools and applications.

Here, stability of the siRNA may vary depending on properties of the chemical materials bonded to ends of the siRNA sense (passenger) or antisense (guide) strand. For example, an siRNA to which a polymer compound such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) is conjugated, interacts with an anionic phosphate group of siRNA in the presence of cationic materials to form a complex, thereby being a carrier having an improved siRNA stability (Local and systemic delivery of VEGF siRNA using polyelectrolyte complex micelles for effective treatment of cancer.

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a novel concept of nanoparticles having a small size and improved polydispersity and an oligonucleotide structure forming the nanoparticles. Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the oligonucleotide structure and nanoparticles formed of the oligonucleotide structure, a pharmaceutical composition including the oligonucleotide structure, and a technology for controlling gene expression using the same. The present inventors found that in a technology of SAMiRNA\u2122 which is the existing self-assembled nanoparticles, when the hydrophilic material of the oligonucletide structure configuring SAMiRNA\u2122 is blocked as a base unit including uniform monomers (the number of monomers is m) having a predetermined molecular weight and a linker as needed, the appropriate number of blocked hydrophilic materials is used as needed, the nanoparticles formed by the oligonucleotide structure have a significantly small size and remarkably improved polydispersity as compared to the existing SAMiRNA\u2122, and completed the present invention.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The oligonucleotide of the present invention is a material consisting of a DNA (deoxyribonucleotide) or RNA (ribonucleotide), and means antisense oligonucleotide formed in a single-strand or a double-strand formed of complementary bindings, small interfering RNA (siRNA), small hairpin RNA (shRNA), microRNA (miRNA), miRNA inhibitor, aptamer, etc., but the present invention is not limited thereto. In particular, when the oligonucleotide in the present invention is the double-stranded oligonucleotide, the antisense strand is a strand that is complementarily bonded to the target mRNA in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to decompose the target mRNA, thereby having RNAi activity, and the sense strand means a strand having a sequence complementary to the antisense strand. \u201ccomplementary\u201d or \u201ccomplementary binding\u201d in the present invention means that two sequences are bonded to each other to form a double-stranded structure, wherein the binding is not necessarily a perfect match binding, and may also include a mismatch in a case where some sequences are different. Further, an miRNA mimic in the present invention is a double-stranded RNA having the same sequence and structure as miRNA present in nature, which means miRNA in a chemically synthesized form. An miRNA inhibitor means a chemically synthesized single-stranded oligonucleotide which is complementarily bonded to miRNA present in nature to inhibit the action of the corresponding miRNA. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a novel form of oligonucleotide structure having a structure represented by the following Structural Formula (1) or Structural Formula (2). Q-(Am-J)n-X\u2014R\u2014Y\u2014B Structural Formula (1) Q-(J-Am)n-X\u2014R\u2014Y\u2014B Structural Formula (2) In Structural Formulas (1) and (2), A is a hydrophilic material monomer, B is a hydrophobic material, J is a linker in which hydrophilic material monomers (the sum is m) are connected to each other or a linker in which hydrophilic material monomers (the sum is m) are connected to oligonucleotides, X and Y are each independently a simple covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond, R is single-stranded or double-stranded oligonucleotide, m is an integer of 1 to 15, and n is an integer of 1 to 10, Q is (Li-Zj) or P-J1-J2, L is a ligand specifically bonded to a receptor that promotes target cell internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME), and Z is a linker that mediates a simple covalent bond or a bond between the hydrophilic material monomer in a hydrophilic material block and the ligand, i represents an integer from 0 to 5, preferably, an integer of 0 to 3, and j means 0 or 1, provided that when i is 0, j is necessarily 0, P means an amine group or a polyhistidine group, and J1 and J2 are independently linkers that mediate a simple covalent bond, or a bond between the amine group or the polyhistidine group with the hydrophilic material. The \u201chydrophilic material block\u201d in the present invention means a repeating unit represented by (Am-J) or (J-Am) in Structural Formulas (1) and (2). In Structural Formulas (1) and (2), the hydrophilic material monomer A is usable without limitation as long as it meets the objects of the present invention among the monomers of the non-ionic hydrophilic polymer. The hydrophilic material monomer A is preferably a monomer selected from the following compounds (1) to (3) shown in Table 1, more preferably, a monomer of the compound (1), and G in the compound (1) may be preferably selected from CH2, O, S and NH. In particular, among the hydrophilic material monomers, the monomer of Compound (1) may have various functional groups introduced thereinto and good affinity in vivo, and induce a little immune response, thereby having excellent bio-compatibility, and further, may increase stability in vivo of the oligonucleotide included in the structures according to Structural Formulas (1) and (2), and may increase delivery efficiency, which is significantly suitable for producing the structure according to the present invention. TABLE 1 Monomer structure of hydrophilic material preferred in the present invention Compound (1) Compound (2) Compound (3) G is CH2, O, S or NH The hydrophilic material in Structural Formulas (1) and (2) preferably has total molecular weight of 1,000 to 2,000. Therefore, for example, when hexaethylene glycol represented by Compound (1), that is, a material in which G is O, and m is 6, is used in Structural Formulas (1) and (2), a molecular weight of hexaethylene glycol spacer is 344, such that the repetition number (n) is preferred to be 3 to 5. In particular, in the present invention, the repeating unit of the hydrophilic group represented by (Am-J) or (J-Am) in Structural Formulas (1) and (2), that is, hydrophilic material block, is capable of being used in an appropriate number represented by n as needed. A, the hydrophilic material monomer, and J, the linker, included in each hydrophilic material block, may be independently the same as each other or be different from each other in each hydrophilic material block. That is, when 3 hydrophilic material blocks are used (n=3), the hydrophilic material monomer of the compound (1) is used in the first block, the hydrophilic material monomer of the compound (2) is used in the second block, the hydrophilic material monomer of the compound (3) is used in the third block, etc. That is, different hydrophilic material monomers for all hydrophilic material blocks may be used, and any one hydrophilic material monomer selected from the hydrophilic material monomers of compounds (1) to (3) may be equally used in all hydrophilic material blocks. Similarly, linkers that mediate the binding of the hydrophilic material monomer may also be same as each other or different from each other for all hydrophilic material blocks. Further, m which is the number of hydrophilic material monomers may be the same as each other or different from each other among all hydrophilic material blocks. That is, 3 hydrophilic material monomers (m=3) are connected in the first hydrophilic material block, 5 hydrophilic material monomers (m=5) are connected in the second hydrophilic material block, 4 hydrophilic material monomers (m=4) are connected in the third hydrophilic material block, etc. That is, hydrophilic material monomers each having different numbers or each having the same number may be used in all hydrophilic material blocks. Further, in the present invention, the linker (J) is preferably selected from the group consisting of PO3\u2212, SO3 and CO2, but the present invention is not limited thereto. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that any linker may be used depending on the used hydrophilic material monomer, etc., as long as it meets the objects of the present invention. Some or all of the hydrophilic material monomer may be modified to have functional groups required for binding with other materials such as a target specific ligand, etc., as needed. The hydrophilic material block may be bonded to any position of 3\u2032 end or 5\u2032 end of the single strand oligo, and may be bonded to any position of 3\u2032 end or 5\u2032 end of the sense strand or the antisense strand of the double-stranded oligo. The hydrophobic materials B in Structural Formulas (1) and (2) form the nanoparticles formed of the oligonucleotide structures of Structural Formulas (1) and (2) through a hydrophobic interaction. The hydrophobic material preferably has a molecular weight of 250 to 1,000, and may include a steroid derivative, a glyceride derivative, glycerol ether, polypropylene glycol, C12 to C50 unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon, diacylphosphatidylcholine, fatty acid, phospholipid, lipopolyamine, etc., but the present invention is not limited thereto. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that any hydrophobic material may be used as long as it meets the objects of the present invention. The steroid derivative may be selected from the group consisting of cholesterol, cholestanol, cholic acid, cholesteryl formate, cholestanyl formate, and cholesteryl amine, and the glyceride derivative may be selected from mono-, di- and tri-glyceride, etc., wherein the fatty acid of the glyceride is preferred to be C12 to C50 unsaturated or saturated fatty acid. In particular, among the hydrophobic materials, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon or cholesterol is preferred since it is easily capable of being bonded in a synthetic step of the oligonucleotide structure according to the present invention, and C24 hydrocarbon, particularly, tetradocosane including a disulfide bond is the most preferred. The hydrophobic material is bonded to the opposite end (distal end) of oligonucleotide bonded to the hydrophilic material block, and may be bonded to any position of the sense strand or the antisense strand of the double-stranded oligo. The oligonucleotide (R) in the present invention may include a double-stranded or single-stranded siRNA or shRNA, antisense microRNA mimic, microRNA inhibitor, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), etc., without limitation, and in particular, the double-stranded siRNA is more preferred. When the double-stranded oligonucleotides such as double-stranded siRNA, miRNA, etc., are used, the sense strand and\/or the antisense strand of the double-stranded oligonucleotide consists of 15 to 40, preferably 19 to 31 nucleotides, and in particular, it is preferred to bind at least one phosphate group, preferably one to three phosphate groups to 5\u2032 end of the antisense strand. Further, the oligonucleotide has various modifications for providing resistance of nuclease and decreasing a non-specific immune stimulation in order to improve stability in vivo, wherein the modification may be one or more combinations selected from modification in which \u2014OH group at 2\u2032 carbon in a sugar structure in one or more nucleotides is substituted with \u2014CH3(methyl), \u2014OCH3 (methoxy), \u2014NH2, \u2014F (fluorine), \u2014O-2-methoxyethyl, \u2014O-propyl, \u2014O-2-methylthioethyl, \u2014O-3-aminopropyl, \u2014O-3-dimethylaminopropyl, \u2014O\u2014N-methylacetamido or \u2014O\u2014 dimethylamidooxyethyl; modification in which oxygen in a sugar structure in nucleotides is substituted with sulfur; and modification to phosphorothioate or boranophosphophate, methyl phosphonate bindings from nucleotides bindings, or may be modification to peptide nucleic acid (PNA), modification to locked nucleic acid (LNA), or modification to unlocked nucleic acid (UNA) (Crooke et al., Ann. Rev. Med. Vol. 55: pp 61-65 2004, U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,985, U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,691, U.S. Pat. No. 6,531,584, U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,023, U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,358, U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,001 Braasch D. A. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 14:1139-1143, 2003; Chiu Y. L. et al., RNA, 9:1034-1048, 2003; Amarzguioui M. et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 31:589-595, 2003, Nucleic Acids Research, 2010, Vol. 38, No. 17 5761-5773, Nucleic Acids Research, 2011, Vol. 39, No. 5 1823-1832). Meanwhile, the tissue of the tumor is rigid to have diffusion-limitation as compared to the normal tissue, wherein this diffusion-limitation affects the movement of the waste, such as nutrients, oxygen and carbon dioxide required for tumor growth, such that the diffusion-limitation is overcome by forming the blood vessels around the tumor through angiogenesis. Blood vessels in tumor tissue formed by the angiogenesis have a leaky and defective blood vessel structure with a gap of 100 nm to 2 um, depending on types of tumors. Therefore, the nanoparticles easily pass through capillary endothelium of cancer tissue having the leaky and defective blood vessel structure as compared to organized capillaries of the normal tissue, such that it is easy to access to tumor interstitium in blood circulation process. In addition, lymphatic vessels (lymphatic drainage) are not present in the tumor tissue, such that drugs are accumulated, which refers to an enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon in which the nanoparticles are tumor-tissue-specifically delivered by this effect, refers to passive targeting (passive targeting) (Nanoparticles for drug delivery in cancer treatment. Urol. Oncol. 2008 January-February; 26(1):57-64). An active targeting represents a case in which a targeting moiety is bonded to the nanoparticle, and it was reported that the active targeting promotes preferential accumulation of the nanoparticles into the target tissue or improves internalization in which the nanoparticles are delivered into the target cell (Does a targeting ligand influence nanoparticle tumor localization or uptake Trends Biotechnol. 2008 October; 26(10):552-8. Epub 2008 Aug. 21). The active targeting uses materials (targeting moiety) having an ability to be capable of being bonded to carbohydrates, receptors, antigens that are specific to target cell surface or over-expressed (Nanotechnology in cancer therapeutics: bioconjugated nanoparticles for drug delivery. Mol Cancer Ther 2006; 5(8): 1909-1917). Therefore, when a targeting moiety is provided in the oligonucleotide structure according to the present invention and the nanoparticle formed therefrom, delivery to the target cell is effectively promoted to achieve delivery to the target cell even in a relatively low concentration of dosage, thereby showing a high control function for target gene expression, and thereby preventing non-specific delivery of the oligonucleotide into other organs and cells. Accordingly, the present invention provides structures represented by Structural Formulas (3) and (4) in which Q is (Li-Zj) in structures according to Structural Formulas (1) and (2), and in which the ligand (L), particularly, the ligand (L) specifically bonded to the receptor that promotes target cell internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME), is additionally included. (Li-Zj)-(Am-J)n-X\u2014R\u2014Y\u2014B Structural Formula (3) (Li-Zj)-(J-Am)n-X\u2014R\u2014Y\u2014B Structural Formula (4) The ligand in Structural Formulas (3) and (4) may be preferably selected from the group consisting of a target receptor-specific antibody or aptamer, peptide having properties of RME for promoting cell internalization in the target cell-specific manner; or folate (generally, folate and folic acid are intersectionally used, and the folate in the present invention means folate in a natural state or in an activated state in a human body), chemicals such as sugar, carbohydrate, etc., including hexoamines such as N-acetyl galactosamine (NAG), etc., glucose, mannose, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In particular, when the ligand of the present invention is sugars such as N-acetyl Galactosamine (NAG), mannose, glucose, etc., the corresponding ligand may not only complement and strengthen hydrophilicity that may be decreased depending on the repeat number of the monomer in the hydrophilic material block, but also provide a targeting effect of the nanoparticles formed of structures according to Structural Formulas (3) and (4) of the present invention, such that the nanoparticles may be easily formed. The ligand may be either directly connected to the hydrophilic material monomer in the hydrophilic material block by a covalent bond, or may be bonded to the hydrophilic material monomer in the hydrophilic material block by a linker (Z) mediating the binding of the ligand. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that when the ligand is covalently bonded to the hydrophilic material monomer in the hydrophilic material block by the linker (Z), any linker may be used as long as it meets the objects of the present invention. In particular, the linker preferably has any one structure selected from Compounds (4) to (7) shown in Table 2 below. TABLE 2 Linker structure preferred in the present invention compound ( 4 ) compound ( 5 ) compound (6) compound ( 7) In Compound (4), T is a compound in which any one compound selected from compounds (1) to (3) is repeated 1 to 15 times, and in particular, it is preferred to repeat the compound represented by Structural Formula (1) 1 to 15 times. In Compound (4), T is bonded to the ligand, and the distal end is bonded to the hydrophilic material monomer in the hydrophilic material block or the linker. Further, in Compounds (5) to (7), the left side of functional group is bonded to the ligand, and the right side is bonded to the hydrophilic material monomer in the hydrophilic material block, and n in Compound (5) is 0 or 1. At least one functional group that is capable of being bonded to the ligand is included in Compounds (5) to (7), such that at least one ligand binding may more improve delivery efficiency of the double-stranded oligo RNA structure according to the present invention into the target tissue. In Structural Formulas (3) and (4), when both of i and j are 0, there is provided an oligonucleotide structure to which the ligand is not bonded, and when i is 1 and j is 0, there is provided a form in which the ligand is directly bonded to the hydrophilic material monomer in the hydrophilic material block, and when i is an integer of 1 or more, and j is 1, there is provided a linker-mediated form in which the ligand is bonded to the hydrophilic material monomer in the hydrophilic material block. In addition, the present invention provides structures in which the amine group or the polyhistidine group is additionally introduced into the end of the hydrophilic material of structures represented by Structural Formulas 1 and 2, particularly, the distal end portion of the end bonded to siRNA, that is, structures represented by Structural Formulas 5 and 6 in which Q is P-J1-J2 in Structural Formulas (1) and (2). P-J1-J2-(Am-J)n-X\u2014R\u2014Y\u2014B Structural Formula (5) P-J1-J2-(J-Am)n-X\u2014R\u2014Y\u2014B Structural Formula (6) In Structural Formulas (5) and (6), J1 and J2 are linkers and are each independently a simple covalent bond or are preferably selected from the group consisting of C2-12 alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, PO3\u2212, SO3, and CO2, but the present invention is not limited thereto. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that any linker is usable as J1 and J2 as long as it meets the objects of the present invention depending on the used hydrophilic material. Preferably, when the amine group is introduced, in Structural Formula (5), J2 is preferably PO3\u2212, and J1 is preferably C6 alkyl, and in Structural Formula (6), J2 is preferably a simple covalent bond, and J1 is preferably C6 alkyl, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In addition, when the polyhistidine group is introduced, in Structural Formula (5), J2 is preferably PO3\u2212, and J1 is preferably Compound (8), and in Structural Formula (6), J2 is preferably a simple covalent bond, and J1 is preferably Compound (8), but the present invention is not limited thereto. The amine group in Structural Formulas (5) and (6) may be primary to tertiary amine groups, and the primary amine group is particularly preferred. The introduced amine group may be present as an amine salt. For example, the salt of the primary amine group may be present in a form of NH3+. Further, the polyhistidine group in Structural Formulas (5) and (6) preferably includes 3 to 10 histidines, more preferably, 5 to 8 histidines, and the most preferably, 6 histidines. In addition to histidine, at least one cystein may be additionally included. The amine group or the polyhistidine group is introduced to easily perform intercellular introduction and escape from the endosome of the oligonucleotide RNA structure, and a possibility of introducing the amine group and using the polyhistidine group to easily perform the intercellular introduction and the escape from the endosome of the carriers such as Quantum dot, Dendrimer, liposome, etc., and the effect thereof, have already been reported. Specifically, it is known that the primary amine group expressed at the end or the outside of the carrier is protonated in vivo pH to form a conjugate with a negatively charged gene by an electrostatic interaction, and the escape from the endosome is easily performed due to internal tertiary amines having a buffer effect at a low pH of the endosome after being introduced into the cells, thereby being capable of protecting the carrier from decomposition of lysosome (Gene Delivery and Expression Inhibition Using Polymer-Based Hybrid Material. Polymer Sci. Technol., Vol. 23, No. 3, pp 254-259). It is known that histidine which is one of non-essential amino acids, has an imidazole ring (pKa3 6.04) at a residue (\u2014R) to increase a buffer capacity (buffering capacity) in the endosome and the lysosome, such that histidine expression may be used to increase an escape efficiency of the endosome in non-viral gene carriers including liposome (Novel histidine-conjugated galactosylated cationic liposomes for efficient hepatocyte selective gene transfer in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. J. Controlled Release 118, pp 262-270). In Structural Formulas (1) to (6) in the present invention, the hydrophilic material block or the hydrophobic material is bonded to oligonucleotide by the simple covalent bond or the linker-mediated covalent bond (X or Y). The linker mediating the covalent bond is covalently bonded to the hydrophilic material block or the hydrophobic material represented by (Am-J)n or (J-Am)n in Structural Formulas (1) and (2) at the end of the oligonucleotide, and is not particularly limited as long as the bond that is possible to be decomposed in a specific environment is provided as needed. Therefore, any compound for the binding to activate the oligonucleotide and\/or the hydrophilic material (or hydrophobic material) in preparation of the oligonucleotide structure may be used as the linker. The covalent bond may be any one of a non-degradable bond or a degradable bond.

Further, since the hydrophilic material monomer in the hydrophilic material block and the number of monomers thereof may be easily controlled, and the number of hydrophilic material blocks to be used may also be easily controlled, the hydrophilic material portions consisting of n hydrophilic material blocks in all oligonucleotide structures are the same as each other, such that the oligonucleotide structure having the hydrophilic material portion has advantages in that it is easy to perform material analysis, and as compared to the oligonucleotide structure synthesized by using the hydrophilic material through additional purification process so as to have the same molecular weight, a synthesis process is simple, and the cost may be reduced. In addition, since the size of nanoparticles formed of the oligonucleotide structure may be regulated by controlling the repetition number of hydrophilic material blocks and hydrophilic material monomers in the hydrophilic material block, the nanoparticles formed based on the oligonucleotide may have significantly reproducible cell delivery capability. Further, the oligonucleotide to which the ligand is bonded, wherein the ligand is particularly sugars such as N-acetyl Galactosamine (NAG), mannose, glucose, etc., and the oligonucleotide structure is represented by Structural Formula (1) or (2), may simultaneously complement and strengthen hydrophilicity that is decreased when the repetition number of hydrophilic material blocks is decreased, thereby stabilizing the formation of the nanoparticles.

Preparation of Double-Stranded Oligo RNA Structure Hereinafter, in order to inhibit Survivin, a double-stranded oligo RNA to Survivin was used. The Survivin, which is protein commonly expressed in most neoplastic tumors or transformed cell lines tested until now, is expected as an important target in cancer treatment (Survivin: a new target for anti-cancer therapy. Cancer Treat Rev. 2009 November; 35(7): 553-62). The double-stranded oligo RNA to Survivin of the present invention consists of a sense strand of SEQ ID NO: 1 and an antisense strand having a complementary sequence thereto, and a double-stranded oligo RNA used as a control group consists of a sense strand of SEQ ID NO: 2 and an antisense strand having a complementary sequence thereto. Base sequences of the double-stranded oligo RNA used in the present Examples are as follows: (SEQ ID NO: 1) 5\u2032-AAG GAG AUC AAC AUU UUC A-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 2) 5\u2032-CUU ACG CUG AGU ACU UCG A-3\u2032 In the double-stranded oligo RNA, the double-stranded oligo RNA single strand was synthesized by a method of using \u03b2-cyanoethylphosphoramidite to connect a phosphodiester bond forming an RNA backbone structure (Polymer support oligonucleotide synthesis XVIII: use of beta-cyanoethyl-N,N-dialkylamino-\/N-morpholinophosphoramidite of deoxynucleosides for the synthesis of DNA fragments simplifying deprotection and isolation of the final product. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984 Jun. 11; 12(11): 4539-57). A desired sequence of the RNA single strand could be obtained by starting the synthesis process on the solid support (CPG) containing nucleoside bonded thereto and repeating cycles including deblocking, coupling, capping, and oxidation. The RNA 384 synthesizer (BIONEER, Korea) was used for a series of the corresponding synthesis process of the double-stranded oligo RNA. In order to analyze physical properties of the nanoparticle formed of the double-stranded oligo RNA structure according to the repetition number of the hydrophilic material monomer forming the double-stranded oligo RNA structure, double-stranded oligo RNA structures having the following structures were prepared. The double-stranded oligo RNA structures to which the ligand prepared in the present invention was bonded, had structures shown in Table 4 below, respectively. TABLE 4 Details of structure to which the ligand prepared in the present invention was bonded Name Detailed structure SAMiRNA C24-5\u2032 S-3\u2032 PEG-NAG AS 5\u2032-PO4 monoSAMi C24-5\u2032 S-3\u2032-hexaethylene glycol-NAG RNA (n = 1) AS 5\u2032-PO4 monoSAMi C24-5\u2032 S-3\u2032 (hexaethylene glycol-PO4\u2212)1-hexaethylene RNA (n = 2) glycol-NAG AS 5\u2032-PO4 monoSAMi C24-5\u2032 S-3\u2032 (hexaethylene glycol-PO4\u2212)2-hexaethylene RNA (n = 3) glycol NAG AS 5\u2032-PO4 monoSAMi C24-5\u2032 S-3\u2032 (hexaethylene glycol-PO4\u2212)3-hexaethylene RNA (n = 4) glycol NAG AS 5\u2032-PO4 In Table 4, S is a sense strand of double-stranded oligo RNA; AS is an antisense strand of double-stranded oligo RNA; PO4 is a phosphate group; NAG is a ligand, N-acetyl galactosamine; PEG is a polydisperse hydrophilic material, that is, polyethylene glycol; hexamethylene glycol-PO3\u2212 is a hydrophilic material monomer in which hexaethylene glycol is bonded through a phosphate group (PO3\u2212); the subscript is the repetition number (n) of the hydrophilic material monomer; C24 is a hydrophobic material, and tetradocosane including a disulfide bond; and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 mean directivities of the double-stranded oligo RNA end.

The antisense strand of double-stranded oligo RNA structure was prepared by the above-described method in which a phosphodiester bond forming an RNA backbone structure is linked using \u03b2-cyanoethylphosphoramidite. Then, in order to bind a phosphate group to 5\u2032 end, chemical phosphorylation reagent (CPR) which is [3-(4,4\u2033 dimethoxytrityloxy)-2,2-dicarboxyethyl]propyl-(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)-phosphoramidite was used to prepare an antisense strand of S-SAMiRNALP-PO4 to which a phosphate group is bonded to 5\u2032 end.

When the synthesis was completed, the RNA single strand and the RNA-polymer structure synthesized by treating 28% (v\/v) ammonia in water bath at 60\u00b0 C. were separated from CPG and protecting moieties were removed therefrom by a deprotection reaction, respectively.

It was confirmed by electrophoresis that the produced double-stranded oligo RNA structures were annealed. Example 3. Analysis of Physical Properties of Nanoparticles Consisting of monoSAMiRNA A nanoparticle, that is, micelle, is formed by a hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic materials bonded to the end of the monoSAMiRNA double-stranded oligo RNA prepared by Example 2 (see FIG. 1). Formation of the nanoparticle (SAMiRNA) consisting of the corresponding monoSAMiRNA was confirmed by analyzing the nanoparticle size and critical micelle concentration (CMC) value according to the repetition number of hydrophilic material monomers of monoSAMiRNA, and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Example 3-1. Measurement of Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of Nanoparticle Consisting of monoSAMiRNA An amphiphile material containing both of hydrophobic groups and hydrophilic groups in a single molecule may be a surfactant, wherein when the surfactant is dissolved into an aqueous solution, the hydrophobic groups thereof move toward the center portion to prevent the hydrophobic groups from being contacted with water and the hydrophilic groups thereof move toward the outside to form a micelle. Here, a concentration at which the micelle is initially formed is referred to as a critical micelle concentration (CMC). A method of measuring CMC using fluorescent pigment is based on property of the fluorescent pigment in which the slope of the graph curve of the fluorescence intensity is rapidly changed before\/after the micelle is formed. In order to measure CMC of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA, 0.04 mM DPH (1,6-Diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, SIGMA, USA) was prepared as the fluorescent pigment. 1 nmole\/\u03bcl of monoSAMiRNA (n=1) was diluted from a concentration of 0.0977 \u03bcg\/ml to the maximum of 50 \u03bcg\/ml with DPBS for each step to prepare monoSAMiRNA (n=1) samples having the total volume of 180 \u03bcl. 20 \u03bcl of 0.04 mM DPH and methanol which is a solvent of DPH for a control group were added to the prepared samples, respectively, and mixed well, and treated by ultrasonic disperser (Wiseclean: DAIHAN, Korea) so that a size of the nanoparticle is homogenized (700 W; amplitude: 20%). The homogenized samples were reacted at room temperature without light for about 24 hours, and fluorescent values (excitation: 355 nm, emission: 428 nm, top read) were measured. In order to confirm relative fluorescent values among the measured fluorescent values, the fluorescent value of the sample containing DPH\u2014the fluorescent value of the sample containing only the methanol (Y axis) at the same concentration was measured and shown as a graph with respect to log value of the treated concentration of monoSAMiRNA (n=1) (X axis). MonoSAMiRNA (n=2) and monoSAMiRNA (n=3) were measured by the same method as described above. The fluorescent value measured for each concentration was rapidly increased while moving from a low concentration section to a high concentration section, wherein the concentration at the rapidly increased point is CMC concentration. Therefore, when drawing trend lines by dividing the low concentration section in which the fluorescent amount is not increased and the high concentration section in which the fluorescent amount is increased into several sections, an X value in an intersection of the two trend lines is CMC concentration. It was observed that the measured CMC of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA (n=1) was 0.83 \u03bcg\/ml, which was relatively high, and the measured CMC of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA (n=2) was 0.33 \u03bcg\/ml, which was significantly low. It was observed that the measured CMC of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA (n=3) was 0.58 \u03bcg\/ml, and the measured CMC of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA (n=4) was 0.44 \u03bcg\/ml (FIG. 15). Accordingly, it was confirmed that the micelle could be well-formed by the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA even at a significantly low concentration. Example 3-2. Preparation of Nanoparticles Consisting of monoSAMiRNA In order to prepare homogenized nanoparticles, the monoSAMiRNA (n=1) was dissolved in 1.5 ml DPBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline) at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg\/ml, and the obtained mixture was freeze-dried under condition of \u221275\u00b0 C. and 5 mTorr for 48 hours. MonoSAMiRNA (n=2), monoSAMiRNA (n=3), and monoSAMiRNA (n=4) were measured by the same method as described above. Example 3-3. Measurement of Size and Polydispersity Index (PDI) of Nanoparticle Consisting of monoSAMiRNA A size of the nanoparticle was measured by zeta-potential measurement. Specifically, a size of the homogenized nanoparticle produced by Example 3-2 was measured by zeta-potential measurement (Nano-ZS, MALVERN, England), under conditions in which a refractive index to the material was 1.459, an absorption index was 0.001, a temperature of a solvent: DPBS was 25\u00b0 C. and the corresponding viscosity and refractive index were 1.0200 and 1.335, respectively. Once measurement was conducted by a size measurement including 15 times repeats and then repeated six times. MonoSAMiRNA (n=1), monoSAMiRNA (n=2), monoSAMiRNA (n=3), and monoSAMiRNA (n=4) were measured by the same method as described above. It was confirmed that a size of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA (n=1) was 111 nm and PDI of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA (n=1) was 0.19. It was confirmed that a size of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA (n=2) was about 86 nm and PDI thereof was 0.25, a size of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA (n=3) was about 80 nm and PDI thereof was 0.30, and a size of the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA (n=4) was about 83 nm and PDI thereof was 0.26 (FIG. 16). As the PDI value is decreased, the corresponding particles become uniformly distributed, and thus, it could be appreciated that the nanoparticle of the present invention has a significantly uniform size. Example 3-4. Observation of Nanoparticle Consisting of monoSAMiRNA by TEM The nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA was observed by TEM in order to confirm the shape thereof. Specifically, the S-SAMiRNA was dissolved into DPBS so as to have the final concentration of 100 \u03bcg\/ml and treated by ultrasonic disperser (Wiseclean: DAIHAN, Korea) so that a size of nanoparticle is homogenized (700 W; amplitude: 20%). The nanoparticle consisting of S-SAMiRNA was observed with a material having a high electron density through a negative staining method. It was confirmed that the nanoparticle observed by TEM had a size similar to that of the nanoparticle measured in Example 3-2. Example 4. Inhibition of Expression of Target Gene in Tumor Cell Line Using Nanoparticle Consisting of monoSAMiRNA The expression aspect of survivin gene of the transfected tumor cell line was analyzed by using the nanoparticle consisting of monoSAMiRNA prepared by Example 3-2. Example 4-1. Culture of Tumor Cell Line Human cervical cancer cell (HeLa) acquired from American type Culture Collection (ATCC) was cultured in EMEM culture medium (ATCC-formulated eagle's minimum essential medium, U.S.A) containing 10% (v\/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units\/ml of penicillin and 100 \u03bcg\/ml of streptomycin, under condition of 37\u00b0 C. and 5% (v\/v) CO2. Example 4-2. Transformation of Tumor Cell Line Using Nanoparticle Consisting of monoSAMiRNA 1\u00d7105 fibroblast cell line cultured by Example 4-1 was cultured in EMEM medium for 18 hours in 12-well plate under condition of 37\u00b0 C. and 5% (v\/v) CO2, and the medium was removed, and the same amount of Opti-MEM medium (GIBCO, USA) for each well was dispensed. 100 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM medium and SAMiRNA and monoSAMiRNA produced by Example 3-2 were added to DPBS at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg\/ml, and the obtained mixture was freeze-dried under condition of \u221275\u00b0 C. and 5 mTorr for 48 hours by the same method as Example 3-1 to produce homogenized nanoparticles. Then, each well of the tumor cell line in which the Opti-MEM is dispensed was treated with a transfection solution at a concentration of 200 nM, and cultured under condition of 37\u00b0 C. and 5% (v\/v) CO2 for the total of 48 hours. Example 4-3. Relative Quantitative Analysis of mRNA of Survivin Gene cDNA was synthesized by extracting the total RNA from the transfected cell line in Example 4-2 above, and an expression amount of Survivin mRNA was relatively quantified by real-time PCR according to a method disclosed in Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 10-2009-0042297 (see FIG. 17). Sur584 means SAMiRNA having double-stranded oligo RNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) specific to the target gene Survivin for each structure of SAMiRNA, and CONT means SAMiRNA including control group sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2) that does not affect expression of the target gene. A degree of inhibiting expression of mRNA of the target gene was calculated with the expression amount of the target gene of a sample treated with Sur584 with respect to the expression amount of the target gene of a sample treated with CONT through comparative quantification. All of monoSAMiRNAs (n=1 to 4) including Survivin-specific double-stranded oligo RNA had an inhibition effect of target gene expression, and it was observed that from monoSAMiRNA (n=2) in which the hydrophilic material blocks are two or more, the high inhibition effect of target gene expression (about 75% or more of inhibition of expression) was maintained. Example 5. Preparation of Double-Stranded Oligo Structure into which Amine Group and\/or Histidine Group is Introduced into Hydrophilic Material Example 5.1.

ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS The oligonucleotide structure according to the present invention may have all of the same hydrophilic material portions, such that problems such as quality control, etc., caused by polydispersity characteristic occurring when a hydrophilic material bonded to the oligonucleotide is a synthetic polymer may be remarkably improved. Further, as compared to the existing purification process using polydispersity hydrophilic materials, the method for preparing the oligonucleotide structure according to the present invention may be simple, may reduce the synthesis cost, and may easily perform material analysis of the oligonucleotide structure. Further, the size of nanoparticles may be regulated by controlling the repetition number of hydrophilic material blocks and hydrophilic material monomers in each hydrophilic material block. In particular, when the ligand is additionally bonded to the receptor that promotes target cell internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) in the oligonucleotide structure according to the present invention, delivery into the target cell is more effectively performed. Further, when the ligand is sugar, together with the targeting effect of the nanoparticles, hydrophilicity which is decreased depending on the repetition number of the hydrophilic material blocks, may be complemented to improve intracellular delivery of the oligonucleotide and to improve an efficacy for controlling gene expression of oligonucletide. Further, after the oligonucleotide structure is absorbed into the cell, the oligonucleotide may be easily escaped from the endosome, and may have an effect of inhibiting the decomposition by lysosome, such that higher treatment effect may be obtained by introducing the amine group or the polyhistidine groups into the hydrophilic material block.

It is one of disease that most commonly affect people in the world. Dengue fever is transmitted by mosquito bites or infected people, causes a high fever and rash with muscle and joint pains, and also causes hemorrhage in some cases. People with dengue hemorrhagic fever are high risk of losing their life. In addition, people have permanent immunity against a dengue viral type that infected them, but are not protected from other viral types. For this reason, in the case people who live in endemic area, infections with all four types of dengue virus may occur throughout their life. The World Health Organization estimates that over 50 million dengue infected people and over one million dengue infected patients each year in worldwide occur. Thus, dengue is considered as one of key public health issues, but a dengue virus preventive vaccine has not yet been reported. Southeastern Asia is the largest endemic area for dengue fever, in which reinfections with several serotypes of dengue virus easily occur. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in secondary dengue infections are the major causes of death (Qiu F X et al., Bull World Health Organ, 71:349-359, 1993; Tassniyom S et al., Pediatrics, 92:111-115, 1993). In Korea, an outbreak of dengue fever has not yet occurred, but it is expected that the number of Korean people infected with dengue virus will increase due to the expansion of trade with dengue endemic areas, trip abroad, overseas residence and the like. In addition, an increase in infection opportunities such as off-road traveling and repeated visits to dengue endemic areas can increase the possibility of reinfection with dengue virus and can also increase the risk of development of DHF or DSS by secondary infection. In fact, in the Korea National Institute of Health, serological tests for 99 persons, who returned from abroad and showed symptoms suspected as dengue fever, were performed during a period from 2001 to June, 2003, and 33 people positive for dengue virus antibodies were found. Dengue virus has four serotypes and a genome size of about 11 kb. The dengue virus genome is translated into a single polyprotein, and then cleaved into functional proteins by host or viral proteases into functional proteins. In a previous vaccine strategy, there was great difficulty in inhibiting dengue virus replication, because effective protection against four similar serotypes with a polyvalent vaccine was not induced. However, in a genetic engineering approach for the viral genome, studies on a vaccine effective against all the four serotypes are in progress, and final clinical trials are in progress by a certain multi-national pharmaceutical company. Generally, primary infection is not fatal, but when secondary infection with different serotypes occurs, effective protection will not be made due to a previously formed antibody, and the viral infection will be increased by ADCC (antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity) to pose great threat to life. To date, only a primary approach has been performed in which cytokine is administered to such patients. Meanwhile, technologies of inhibiting the expression of genes are an important tool in developing a therapeutic agent for treating diseases and validating a target. Since the roles of RNA interference (hereinafter referred to as \u2018RNAi\u2019) among these technologies was found, it was found that the RNAi acts on sequence-specific mRNA in various kinds of mammalian cells (Silence of the Transcripts: RNA Interference in Medicine. J Mol Med (2005) 83: 764-773). When long-chain double-stranded RNA is delivered into cells, the delivered double stranded RNA is converted into a small interfering RNA (hereinafter referred to as \u2018siRNA\u2019) processed into 21 to 23 base pairs (bp) by the endonuclease Dicer, wherein the siRNA inhibits the expression of the target gene in a sequence-specific manner by a process in which the antisense strand recognizes and degrades the target mRNA (NUCLEIC-ACID THERAPEUTICS: BASIC PRINCIPLES AND RECENT APPLICATIONS. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. 2002. 1, 503-514). Bertrand et al. have reported that siRNA has an excellent inhibitory effect on the expression of mRNA in vitro and in vivo compared to an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) for the same target gene and that the effect is long lasting (Comparison of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs in cell culture and in vivo. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002. 296: 1000-1004). Also, because siRNA complementarily binds to the target mRNA to regulate the expression of the target gene in a sequence-specific manner, it can be advantageously used in a wider range of applications compared to conventional antibody-based drugs or chemicals (small molecule drugs) (Progress Towards in Vivo Use of siRNAs. MOLECMLAR THERAPY. 2006 13(4):664-670). siRNA has excellent effects and can be used in a wide range of applications, but in order for siRNA to be developed into therapeutic agents, it is required to improve the in vivo stability and intracellular delivery efficiency of siRNA so as to effectively deliver siRNA into its target cells (Harnessing in vivo siRNA delivery for drug discovery and therapeutic development. Drug Discov Today. 2006 January; 11(1-2):67-73). In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, studies on a technology of either modifying some nucleotides of siRNA or the backbone of siRNA to improve the in vivo stability so as to have resistance against nuclease or using carriers such as a viral vector, liposome or nanoparticles have been actively conducted. Delivery systems comprising a viral vector such as adenovirus or retrovirus have high transfection efficiency, carry the risks of immunogenicity and oncogenicity. However, non-viral carriers including nanoparticles are evaluated to have low intracellular delivery efficiency compared to viral carriers, but have advantages, including high safety in vivo, target-specific delivery, efficient uptake and internalization of RNAi oligonucleotides into cells or tissues, and low cytotoxicity and immune stimulation. Thus, these non-viral carriers are considered as a promising delivery method compared to the vial delivery system (Nonviral delivery of synthetic siRNA s in vivo. J Clin Invest. 2007 Dec. 3; 117(12): 3623-3632). In a method of using nanocarriers among the non-viral delivery systems, nanoparticles are formed using various polymers such as liposome, a cationic polymer complex and the like, and iRNA is supported on these nanoparticles that are nanocarriers, and is delivered into the cell. In the method of using nanocarriers, a polymeric nanoparticle, polymer micelle, lipoplex and the like are mainly used. Among them, the lipoplex is composed of cationic lipid and interacts with anionic lipid of endosome in the cell to destabilize the endosome, thereby serving to deliver the iRNA into the cell (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 15; 93(21):11493-8, 1996). In addition, it is known that the efficiency of siRNA in vivo can be increased by conjugating a chemical compound or the like to the end region of the passenger (sense) strand of the siRNA so as to have improved pharmacokinetic characteristics (Nature 11; 432(7014):173-8, 2004). In this case, the stability of the siRNA changes depending on the property of the chemical compound conjugated to the end of the sense (passenger) or antisense (guide) strand of the siRNA. For example, siRNA conjugated with a polymer compound such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) interacts with the anionic phosphoric acid group of siRNA in the presence of a cationic compound to form a complex, thereby providing a carrier having improved siRNA stability (J Control Release 129(2):107-16, 2008). Particularly, micelles made of a polymer complex have a very small size and a very uniform size distribution compared to other drug delivery systems such as microspheres or nanoparticles, and are spontaneously formed. Thus, these micelles have advantages in that the quality of the formulation is easily managed and the reproducibility thereof is easily secured. Further, in order to improve the intracellular delivery efficiency of siRNA, a technology for securing the stability of the siRNA and increasing the cell membrane permeability of the siRNA using a siRNA conjugate obtained by conjugating a hydrophilic compound (for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG)), which is a biocompatible polymer, to the siRNA via a simple covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond, has been developed (Korean Patent Registration No. 883471). However, even when the siRNA is chemically modified and conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PEGylation), it still has low stability in vivo and a disadvantage in that it is not easily delivered into a target organ. In order to solve these disadvantages, double-stranded oligo RNA structures comprising hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds bound to an oligonucleotide, particularly double-stranded oligo RNA such as siRNA have been developed. These structures form self-assembled nanoparticles, named SAMiRNA\u2122 (Self Assembled Micelle Inhibitory RNA), by hydrophobic interaction of the hydrophobic compound (see Korean Patent Registration No. 1224828). The SAMiRNA\u2122 technology has advantages over conventional delivery technologies in that homogenous nanoparticles having a very small size can be obtained. Specifically, in the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology, PEG (polyethylene glycol) is used as the hydrophilic compound. PEG is a synthetic polymer and is generally used to increase the solubility of medical drugs, particularly proteins, and control the pharmacokinetics of drugs. PEG is a polydisperse material, and a one-batch polymer is made up of different numbers of monomers, and thus shows a molecular weight in the form of a gauss curve. Also, the homogeneity of a material is expressed as the polydisperse index (Mw\/Mn). In other words, when PEG has a low molecular weight (3-5 kDa), it shows a polydisperse index of about 1.01, and when it has a high molecular weight (20 kDa), it shows a high a polydisperse index of about 1.2, indicating that the homogeneity of PEG decreases as the molecular weight of PEG increases (F. M. Veronese. Peptide and protein PEGylation: a review of problems and solutions. Biomaterials (2001) 22:405-417). Thus, when PEG is bound to a medical drug, there is a disadvantage in that the polydisperse properties of PEG are reflected to the conjugate so that the verification of a single material is not easy. Due to this disadvantage, processes for the synthesis and purification of PEG have been improved in order to produce materials having a low polydisperse index. However, when PEG is bound to a compound having a low molecular weight, there are problems associated with the polydisperse properties of the compound, causing a problem in that it is not easy to confirm whether the binding was easily achieved (Francesco M. Veronese and Gianfranco Pasut. PEGylation, successful approach to drug delivery. DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY (2005) 10(21):1451-1458). Accordingly, in recent years, the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology (that is self-assembled nanoparticles) has been improved by forming the hydrophilic compound of the double-stranded RNA structure (constituting SAMiRNA\u2122) into basic unit blocks, each comprising 1-15 monomers having a uniform molecular weight, and if necessary, a linker, so that a suitable number of the blocks will be used, if required. Thus, new types of delivery system technologies, which have small sizes and significantly improved polydisperse properties, compared to conventional SAMiRNA\u2122, have been developed. As described above, a therapeutic agent having an excellent therapeutic effect against most serotypes of dengue virus is not currently present, and conventional vaccination methods have limitations. Thus, there is an urgent need for the treatment of a new type of therapeutic agent. A dengue virus infection therapeutic agent based on RNAi technology has a potential to be used as an alternative thereto, but an effective therapeutic agent based on RNAi technology, particularly a therapeutic agent having a therapeutic effect against all dengue virus serotypes, has not yet been developed.","summary":"<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 shows the results of multiple sequence alignment of the 5\u2032-UTR region of the genome sequence of dengue virus.

The siRNA included in the double-stranded oligo RNA structures is preferably a dengue virus-specific siRNA. Moreover, the present invention relates to a method for preparing the double-stranded oligo RNA structure, and a pharmaceutical composition for the inhibition of dengue virus replication and the prevention and treatment of dengue viral infection, which comprises the double-stranded oligo RNA structure. BACKGROUND ART Dengue virus is a virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, which has a single strand RNA and a single envelope having a diameter of 30 nm and shows positive polarity. It is one of disease that most commonly affect people in the world. Dengue fever is transmitted by mosquito bites or infected people, causes a high fever and rash with muscle and joint pains, and also causes hemorrhage in some cases. People with dengue hemorrhagic fever are high risk of losing their life. In addition, people have permanent immunity against a dengue viral type that infected them, but are not protected from other viral types. For this reason, in the case people who live in endemic area, infections with all four types of dengue virus may occur throughout their life. The World Health Organization estimates that over 50 million dengue infected people and over one million dengue infected patients each year in worldwide occur. Thus, dengue is considered as one of key public health issues, but a dengue virus preventive vaccine has not yet been reported. Southeastern Asia is the largest endemic area for dengue fever, in which reinfections with several serotypes of dengue virus easily occur. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in secondary dengue infections are the major causes of death (Qiu F X et al., Bull World Health Organ, 71:349-359, 1993; Tassniyom S et al., Pediatrics, 92:111-115, 1993). In Korea, an outbreak of dengue fever has not yet occurred, but it is expected that the number of Korean people infected with dengue virus will increase due to the expansion of trade with dengue endemic areas, trip abroad, overseas residence and the like. In addition, an increase in infection opportunities such as off-road traveling and repeated visits to dengue endemic areas can increase the possibility of reinfection with dengue virus and can also increase the risk of development of DHF or DSS by secondary infection. In fact, in the Korea National Institute of Health, serological tests for 99 persons, who returned from abroad and showed symptoms suspected as dengue fever, were performed during a period from 2001 to June, 2003, and 33 people positive for dengue virus antibodies were found. Dengue virus has four serotypes and a genome size of about 11 kb. The dengue virus genome is translated into a single polyprotein, and then cleaved into functional proteins by host or viral proteases into functional proteins. In a previous vaccine strategy, there was great difficulty in inhibiting dengue virus replication, because effective protection against four similar serotypes with a polyvalent vaccine was not induced. However, in a genetic engineering approach for the viral genome, studies on a vaccine effective against all the four serotypes are in progress, and final clinical trials are in progress by a certain multi-national pharmaceutical company. Generally, primary infection is not fatal, but when secondary infection with different serotypes occurs, effective protection will not be made due to a previously formed antibody, and the viral infection will be increased by ADCC (antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity) to pose great threat to life. To date, only a primary approach has been performed in which cytokine is administered to such patients. Meanwhile, technologies of inhibiting the expression of genes are an important tool in developing a therapeutic agent for treating diseases and validating a target. Since the roles of RNA interference (hereinafter referred to as \u2018RNAi\u2019) among these technologies was found, it was found that the RNAi acts on sequence-specific mRNA in various kinds of mammalian cells (Silence of the Transcripts: RNA Interference in Medicine. J Mol Med (2005) 83: 764-773). When long-chain double-stranded RNA is delivered into cells, the delivered double stranded RNA is converted into a small interfering RNA (hereinafter referred to as \u2018siRNA\u2019) processed into 21 to 23 base pairs (bp) by the endonuclease Dicer, wherein the siRNA inhibits the expression of the target gene in a sequence-specific manner by a process in which the antisense strand recognizes and degrades the target mRNA (NUCLEIC-ACID THERAPEUTICS: BASIC PRINCIPLES AND RECENT APPLICATIONS. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. 2002. 1, 503-514). Bertrand et al. have reported that siRNA has an excellent inhibitory effect on the expression of mRNA in vitro and in vivo compared to an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) for the same target gene and that the effect is long lasting (Comparison of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs in cell culture and in vivo. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002. 296: 1000-1004). Also, because siRNA complementarily binds to the target mRNA to regulate the expression of the target gene in a sequence-specific manner, it can be advantageously used in a wider range of applications compared to conventional antibody-based drugs or chemicals (small molecule drugs) (Progress Towards in Vivo Use of siRNAs. MOLECMLAR THERAPY. 2006 13(4):664-670). siRNA has excellent effects and can be used in a wide range of applications, but in order for siRNA to be developed into therapeutic agents, it is required to improve the in vivo stability and intracellular delivery efficiency of siRNA so as to effectively deliver siRNA into its target cells (Harnessing in vivo siRNA delivery for drug discovery and therapeutic development. Drug Discov Today. 2006 January; 11(1-2):67-73). In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, studies on a technology of either modifying some nucleotides of siRNA or the backbone of siRNA to improve the in vivo stability so as to have resistance against nuclease or using carriers such as a viral vector, liposome or nanoparticles have been actively conducted. Delivery systems comprising a viral vector such as adenovirus or retrovirus have high transfection efficiency, carry the risks of immunogenicity and oncogenicity. However, non-viral carriers including nanoparticles are evaluated to have low intracellular delivery efficiency compared to viral carriers, but have advantages, including high safety in vivo, target-specific delivery, efficient uptake and internalization of RNAi oligonucleotides into cells or tissues, and low cytotoxicity and immune stimulation. Thus, these non-viral carriers are considered as a promising delivery method compared to the vial delivery system (Nonviral delivery of synthetic siRNA s in vivo. J Clin Invest. 2007 Dec. 3; 117(12): 3623-3632). In a method of using nanocarriers among the non-viral delivery systems, nanoparticles are formed using various polymers such as liposome, a cationic polymer complex and the like, and iRNA is supported on these nanoparticles that are nanocarriers, and is delivered into the cell. In the method of using nanocarriers, a polymeric nanoparticle, polymer micelle, lipoplex and the like are mainly used. Among them, the lipoplex is composed of cationic lipid and interacts with anionic lipid of endosome in the cell to destabilize the endosome, thereby serving to deliver the iRNA into the cell (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 15; 93(21):11493-8, 1996). In addition, it is known that the efficiency of siRNA in vivo can be increased by conjugating a chemical compound or the like to the end region of the passenger (sense) strand of the siRNA so as to have improved pharmacokinetic characteristics (Nature 11; 432(7014):173-8, 2004). In this case, the stability of the siRNA changes depending on the property of the chemical compound conjugated to the end of the sense (passenger) or antisense (guide) strand of the siRNA. For example, siRNA conjugated with a polymer compound such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) interacts with the anionic phosphoric acid group of siRNA in the presence of a cationic compound to form a complex, thereby providing a carrier having improved siRNA stability (J Control Release 129(2):107-16, 2008). Particularly, micelles made of a polymer complex have a very small size and a very uniform size distribution compared to other drug delivery systems such as microspheres or nanoparticles, and are spontaneously formed. Thus, these micelles have advantages in that the quality of the formulation is easily managed and the reproducibility thereof is easily secured. Further, in order to improve the intracellular delivery efficiency of siRNA, a technology for securing the stability of the siRNA and increasing the cell membrane permeability of the siRNA using a siRNA conjugate obtained by conjugating a hydrophilic compound (for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG)), which is a biocompatible polymer, to the siRNA via a simple covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond, has been developed (Korean Patent Registration No. 883471). However, even when the siRNA is chemically modified and conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PEGylation), it still has low stability in vivo and a disadvantage in that it is not easily delivered into a target organ. In order to solve these disadvantages, double-stranded oligo RNA structures comprising hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds bound to an oligonucleotide, particularly double-stranded oligo RNA such as siRNA have been developed. These structures form self-assembled nanoparticles, named SAMiRNA\u2122 (Self Assembled Micelle Inhibitory RNA), by hydrophobic interaction of the hydrophobic compound (see Korean Patent Registration No. 1224828). The SAMiRNA\u2122 technology has advantages over conventional delivery technologies in that homogenous nanoparticles having a very small size can be obtained. Specifically, in the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology, PEG (polyethylene glycol) is used as the hydrophilic compound. PEG is a synthetic polymer and is generally used to increase the solubility of medical drugs, particularly proteins, and control the pharmacokinetics of drugs. PEG is a polydisperse material, and a one-batch polymer is made up of different numbers of monomers, and thus shows a molecular weight in the form of a gauss curve. Also, the homogeneity of a material is expressed as the polydisperse index (Mw\/Mn). In other words, when PEG has a low molecular weight (3-5 kDa), it shows a polydisperse index of about 1.01, and when it has a high molecular weight (20 kDa), it shows a high a polydisperse index of about 1.2, indicating that the homogeneity of PEG decreases as the molecular weight of PEG increases (F. M. Veronese. Peptide and protein PEGylation: a review of problems and solutions. Biomaterials (2001) 22:405-417). Thus, when PEG is bound to a medical drug, there is a disadvantage in that the polydisperse properties of PEG are reflected to the conjugate so that the verification of a single material is not easy. Due to this disadvantage, processes for the synthesis and purification of PEG have been improved in order to produce materials having a low polydisperse index. However, when PEG is bound to a compound having a low molecular weight, there are problems associated with the polydisperse properties of the compound, causing a problem in that it is not easy to confirm whether the binding was easily achieved (Francesco M. Veronese and Gianfranco Pasut. PEGylation, successful approach to drug delivery. DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY (2005) 10(21):1451-1458). Accordingly, in recent years, the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology (that is self-assembled nanoparticles) has been improved by forming the hydrophilic compound of the double-stranded RNA structure (constituting SAMiRNA\u2122) into basic unit blocks, each comprising 1-15 monomers having a uniform molecular weight, and if necessary, a linker, so that a suitable number of the blocks will be used, if required. Thus, new types of delivery system technologies, which have small sizes and significantly improved polydisperse properties, compared to conventional SAMiRNA\u2122, have been developed. As described above, a therapeutic agent having an excellent therapeutic effect against most serotypes of dengue virus is not currently present, and conventional vaccination methods have limitations. Thus, there is an urgent need for the treatment of a new type of therapeutic agent. A dengue virus infection therapeutic agent based on RNAi technology has a potential to be used as an alternative thereto, but an effective therapeutic agent based on RNAi technology, particularly a therapeutic agent having a therapeutic effect against all dengue virus serotypes, has not yet been developed. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION Technical Problem The present inventors have made extensive efforts to solve the above-described problems, and as a result, have found that a siRNA candidate derived from the conserved sequence of dengue virus inhibits the replication of all dengue virus serotypes with high efficiency, thereby completing the present invention. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel siRNA capable of inhibiting the expression of serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of dengue virus with very high efficiency in a manner specific for the serotypes, a double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the novel siRNA, and a method for preparing the double-stranded oligo RNA structure. Another object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for the inhibition of dengue virus replication and\/or the prevention and treatment of dengue virus infection, which contains, as an active ingredient, the dengue virus-specific siRNA or the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the siRNA. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for the inhibition of dengue virus replication and\/or the prevention and treatment of dengue virus infection, which comprises using the dengue virus-specific siRNA or the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the siRNA. Technical Solution The present invention provides a dengue virus-specific siRNA comprising a first oligonucleotide which is a sense strand having any one sequence selected from among SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO: 88, and a second oligonucleotide which is an antisense strand having a sequence complementary to that of the sense strand. As used herein, the term \u201csiRNA\u201d is intended to include all materials having general RNAi (RNA interference) activity, and it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the dengue virus-specific siRNA also includes dengue virus-specific shRNA and the like. Each of the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO: 88 is the sense strand sequence of the dengue virus-specific siRNA, and targets a conserved region present in all dengue virus serotypes. Thus, it has the property of inhibiting the replication of all dengue virus serotypes, thereby exhibiting the effect of preventing and\/or treating dengue virus infection. The siRNA according to the present invention preferably comprises a dengue virus-specific siRNA sense strand having a sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 8, 13, 16, 20, 22, 23, 29, 32, 34, 39 to 42, 44 to 47, 51, 52, 70 to 72, 76, 77 and 80 to 82. More preferably, it comprises a dengue virus-specific siRNA sense strand having a sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 4, 16, 22, 51, 52, 71 and 82. Most preferably, it comprises a dengue virus-specific siRNA sense strand having a sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 51, 52, 71 and 82. The sense strand or antisense strand of the siRNA according to the present invention preferably consists of 19 to 31 nucleotides, and the siRNA according to the present invention comprises a sense strand having a sequence of any one selected from the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO: 88, and an antisense strand complementary thereto. The sense strand or antisense strand of the siRNA according to the present invention may bind to the sequences of serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of dengue virus. The dengue virus-specific siRNA according to the present invention has a nucleotide sequence designed such that it can bind complementary to an mRNA encoding the gene of interest, and thus it can effectively inhibit the expression of the gene of interest. Also, the 3\u2032 end of the siRNA may comprise an overhang having one or two or more unpaired nucleotides. In addition, the siRNA may comprise various chemical modifications for imparting nuclease resistance and reducing non-specific immune responses in order to increase the in vivo stability thereof. A modification of the first or second oligonucleotide of the siRNA according to the present invention may be one modification or a combination of two or more modifications selected from among: modification in which an OH group at the 2\u2032 carbon position of a sugar structure in one or more nucleotides is substituted with \u2014CH3 (methyl), \u2014OCH3 (methoxy), \u2014NH2, \u2014F (fluorine), \u2014O-2-methoxyethyl-O-propyl, \u2014O-2-methylthioethyl, \u2014O-3-aminopropyl, \u2014O-3-dimethylaminopropyl, \u2014O\u2014N-methylacetamido or \u2014O-dimethylamidooxyethyl; modification in which oxygen in a sugar structure in nucleotides is substituted with sulfur; modification of a bond between nucleotides to a phosphorothioate, boranophosphophate or methyl phosphonate bond; and modification to PNA (peptide nucleic acid), LNA (locked nucleic acid) or UNA (unlocked nucleic acid) (Ann. Rev. Med. 55, 61-65 2004; U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,985; U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,691; U.S. Pat. No. 6,531,584; U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,023; U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,358; U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,001; Bioorg. Med. Chem.

The dengue virus-specific siRNA according to the present invention reduces the expression of the gene of interest and significantly reduces the expression of the protein of interest, thereby inhibiting the release of progeny virus into a cell culture medium. In another aspect, the present invention provides a conjugate in which a hydrophilic compound and a hydrophobic compound are conjugated to both ends of the dengue virus-specific siRNA in order to ensure the efficient in vivo delivery of the siRNA and increase the stability of the siRNA. The siRNA conjugate comprising the hydrophilic compound and hydrophobic compound conjugated to the siRNA as described above forms self-assembled nanoparticles by the hydrophobic interaction of the hydrophobic compound moieties (see Korean Patent Registration No. 1224828). This conjugate has advantages in that it has very high in vivo delivery efficiency and in vivo stability, and also has a uniform particle size distribution, and thus the quality control (QC) thereof is easy so that a process for preparing a drug from the conjugate is simple. In a preferred embodiment, a double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA according to the present invention preferably has a structure represented by the following structural formula (1): A-X-R-Y-B Structural formula (1) wherein A represents a hydrophilic compound, B represents a hydrophobic compound, X and Y each independently represents a simple covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond, and R represents a dengue virus-specific siRNA. More preferably, the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA according to the present invention preferably has a structure represented by the following structural formula (2): wherein A, B, X and Y are as defined in structural formula (1) above, S represents the sense strand of the dengue virus-specific siRNA, and AS represents the antisense strand of the dengue virus-specific siRNA. More preferably, the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA has a structure represented by the following formula (3) or (4): wherein A, B, S, AS, X and Y are as defined in structural formula (1) above, and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 represent the 5\u2032 end and 3\u2032 end of the sense strand of the dengue virus-specific siRNA. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that one to three phosphate groups may be bound to the 5\u2032 end of the antisense strand of the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA as shown in structural formula (1) to structural formula (4) and that shRNA may be used in place of the siRNA. The hydrophilic compound in structural formula (1) to structural formula (4) above is preferably a cationic or nonionic polymer compound having a molecular weight of 200-10,000, and more preferably a nonionic polymer compound having a molecular weight of 1,000-2,000. For example, the hydrophilic polymer compound that is used in the present invention is preferably a nonionic hydrophilic polymer compound such as polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or polyoxazoline, but is not limited thereto. Particularly, the hydrophilic compound (A) in structural formula (1) to structural formula (4) may be used in the form of hydrophilic blocks as shown in the following structural formula (5) or (6), and a suitable number (n in structural formula (5) or (6)) may be used as required, thereby overcoming the problems associated with polydisperse properties that may occur when general synthetic polymer compounds: (A\u2032m-J)n Structural formula (5) (J-A\u2032m)n Structural formula (6) wherein A\u2032 represents a hydrophilic monomer, J represents a linker that connects between a number (m) of hydrophilic monomers or connects a number (m) of hydrophilic monomers with siRNA, m is an integer ranging from 1 to 15, n is an integer ranging from 1 to 10, and a repeat unit represented by (A\u2032m-J) or (J-Am\u2032) corresponds to the basic unit of the hydrophilic block. If the hydrophilic block as shown in structural formula (5) or (6) above is used, the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA according to the present invention may have a structure as shown in the following structural formula (7) or (8): (A\u2032m-J)n-X-R-Y-B Structural formula (7) (J-A\u2032m)n-X-R-Y-B Structural formula (8) wherein X, R, Y and B are as defined in structural formula (1) above, and A\u2032, J, m and n are as defined in structural formula (5) and (6) above. As the hydrophilic monomer (A\u2032) in structural formula (5) to structural formula (8) above, one selected from among nonionic hydrophilic polymers may be used without limitation, as long as it coincides with the purpose of the present invention. Preferably, a monomer selected from among compound (1) to compound (3) set forth in Table 1 below may be used. More preferably, a monomer of compound (1) may be used. In compound (1), G may preferably be selected from among CH2, O, S and NH. Particularly, among hydrophilic monomers, the monomer represented by compound (1) is very suitable for the preparation of the structure according to the present invention, because it has advantages in that it can introduce various functional groups, has good biocompatibility to induce less immune responses, can increase the in vivo stability of the siRNA included in the structure represented by structural formula (7) or (8), and can increase the delivery efficiency of the siRNA. TABLE 1 Structure of hydrophilic monomers used in the present invention Compound (1) Compound (2) Compound (3) The total molecular weight of the hydrophilic compound (hydrophilic compound block) in structural formula (5) to structural formula (8) is preferably in the range of 1,000 to 2,000. Thus, for example, when compound (1) in structural formula (7) and structural formula (8) is hexaethylene glycol that is a compound in which G is O and m is 6, the repeat number (n) is preferably 3 to 5, because the hexaethylene glycol space has a molecular weight of 344. Particularly, the present invention is characterized in that a suitable number (represented by n) of repeat units of the hydrophilic group (hydrophilic blocks) represented by (A\u2032m-J) or (J-A\u2032m)n in structural formula (5) and structural formula (6) may be used as required. The hydrophilic monomer J and linker J included in each hydrophilic block may be the same or different between the hydrophilic blocks. In other words, when 3 hydrophilic blocks are used (n=3), the hydrophilic monomer of compound (1), the hydrophilic monomer of compound (2) and the hydrophilic monomer of compound (3) may be used in the first, second and third blocks, respectively, suggesting that different monomers may be used in all hydrophilic blocks. Alternatively, any one selected from the hydrophilic monomers of compounds (1) to (3) may also be used in all the hydrophilic blocks. Similarly, as the linker that mediates the bonding of the hydrophilic monomer, the same linker may be used in the hydrophilic blocks, or different linkers may be used in the hydrophilic blocks. In addition, m that is the number of the hydrophilic monomers may also be the same or different between the hydrophilic blocks. In other words, in the first hydrophilic block, three hydrophilic monomers are connected (m=3), and in the second hydrophilic block, five hydrophilic monomers are connected (m=5), and in the third hydrophilic block, four hydrophilic monomers are connected (m=4), suggesting that different numbers of the hydrophilic monomers may be used in the hydrophilic blocks. Alternatively, the same number of the hydrophilic monomers may also be used in all the hydrophilic blocks. In addition, in the present invention, the linker (J) is preferably selected from the group consisting of PO3\u2212, SO3 and CO2, but is not limited thereto. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that any linker selected depending on the hydrophilic monomer used may be used, as long as it coincides with the purpose of the present invention. The hydrophobic compound (B) in structural formula (1) to structural formula (4), structural formula (7) and structural formula (8) functions to form nanoparticles made of the oligonucleotide structure as shown in structural formula (1) to structural formula (4), structural formula (7) and structural formula (8) by hydrophobic interactions. The hydrophobic compound preferably has a molecular weight of 250-1,000, and may be a steroid derivative, a glyceride derivative, glycerol ether, polypropylene glycol, a C12-C50 unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon, diacylphosphatidylcholine, fatty acid, phospholipid, lipopolyamine or the like, but is not limited thereto. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that any hydrophobic compound may be used, as long as it coincides with the purpose of the present invention. The steroid derivative may be selected from the group consisting of cholesterol, cholestanol, cholic acid, cholesteryl formate, cholestanyl formate, and cholesteryl amine, in which the glyceride derivative may be selected from mono-, di-, and tri-glycerides, and the like. Herein, fatty acid of the glyceride is preferably C12-C50 unsaturated or saturated fatty acid. Particularly, among the hydrophobic compounds, the saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon or cholesterol is preferably used, because it can be easily bound in a process of synthesizing the oligonucleotide structure according to the present invention. Most preferably, a C24 hydrocarbon, particularly tetradocosane containing a disulfide bond is used. The hydrophobic compound may be bound to the distal end of the hydrophilic compound, and may be bound to any position of the sense or antisense strand of the siRNA. The hydrophilic compound or hydrophobic compound in structural formulas (1) to (4), (7) and (8) according to the present invention is bound to the dengue virus-specific siRNA by a single covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent (X or Y). The linker that mediates the covalent bond is covalently bound to the hydrophilic or hydrophobic compound at the end of the dengue virus-specific siRNA, and is not specifically limited as long as it provides a degradable bond in a specific environment, if required. Therefore, the linker that is used in the present invention may be any compound that is bound in order to activate the dengue virus-specific siRNA and\/or the hydrophilic (or hydrophobic) compound in the process of preparing the double-stranded oligo RNA structure according to the present invention. The covalent bond may be any one of a non-degradable bond and a degradable bond. Herein, examples of the non-degradable bond include, but are not limited to, an amide bond and a phosphate bond, and examples of the degradable bond include, but are not limited to, a disulfide bond, an acid-degradable bond, an ester bond, an anhydride bond, a biodegradable bond, and an enzyme-degradable bond. As the siRNA represented by R (or S and AS) in structural formulas (1) to (4), (7) and (8), any siRNA having the property of binding specifically to dengue virus may be used without limitation. Preferably, the siRNA that is used in the present invention comprises a sense strand comprising any one sequence selected from among SEQ ID NO: 1 to SEQ ID NO: 88, and an antisense strand having a sequence complementary to that of the sense strand. The siRNA according to the present invention preferably comprises a dengue virus-specific siRNA sense strand having a sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 8, 13, 16, 20, 22, 23, 29, 32, 34, 39 to 42, 44 to 47, 51, 52, 70 to 72, 76, 77 and 80 to 82. More preferably, it comprises a dengue virus-specific siRNA sense strand having a sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 4, 16, 22, 51, 52, 71 and 82. Most preferably, it comprises a dengue virus-specific siRNA sense strand having a sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS: 51, 52, 71 and 82. In the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA according to the present invention, an amine or polyhistidine group may additionally be introduced into the distal end of the hydrophilic compound bound to the siRNA in the structure. This facilitates the intracellular uptake and endosomal escape of a carrier comprising the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA according to the present invention, and it has been already reported that the introduction of an amine group and a polyhistidine group can be used to facilitate the intracellular introduction and endosomal escape of carriers such as quantum dots, dendrimers or liposome. Specifically, it is known that a primary amine group introduced into the end or outside of a carrier is protonated at biological pH while forming a conjugate by interaction with a negatively charged gene, and that endosomal escape is facilitated due to an internal tertiary amine having a buffering effect at low pH after intracellular uptake, and thus the carrier can be protected from lysosomal degradation (inhibition of gene delivery and expression using a polymer-based hybrid material, Polymer Sci. Technol., Vol. 23, No. 3, pp 254-259). Also, it is known that histidine, a non-essential amino acid, has an imidazole ring (pKa=6.04) at the residue (-R), and thus has the effect of increasing buffering capacity in endosome and lysosome, and thus histidine modification may be used in non-viral gene carriers, including liposome, in order to increase endosomal escape efficiency (Novel histidine-conjugated galactosylated cationic liposomes for efficient hepatocyte selective gene transfer in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. J. Controlled Release 118, pp 262-270). The amine group or polyhistidine group may be connected to the hydrophilic compound or the hydrophilic block by one or more linkers. When the amine group or polyhistidine group is introduced into the hydrophilic compound of the double-stranded oligo RNA structure represented by structural formula (1) according to the present invention, the RNA structure may have a structure as shown in the following structural formula (9): P-J1-J2-A-X-R-Y-B Structural formula (9) wherein A, B, R, X and Y are as defined in structural formula (1) above, P represents an amine group or polyhistidine group, and J1 and J2 are linkers and may be each independently selected from among a simple covalent bond, PO3\u2212, SO3, CO2, a C2-12 alkyl, alkenyl and alkinyl, but are not limited thereto. It will be obvious skilled in the art that any linker may be used as J1 and J2, as long as it coincides with the purpose of the present invention. Preferably, when an amine group is introduced, J2 is a simple covalent bond or PO3\u2212, and J1 is a C6 alkyl, but are not limited thereto. In addition, when a polyhistidine group is introduced, it is preferred that J2 in structural formula (9) is a simple covalent bond or PO3\u2212, and J1 is compound (4), but are not limited thereto. In addition, when the hydrophilic compound of the double-stranded oligo RNA structure as shown in structural formula (9) is the hydrophilic block represented by structural formula (5) or (6) and is introduced with an amine group or a polyhistidine group, the RNA structure may have a structure as shown in the following structural formula (10) or (11): P-J1-J2-(A\u2032m-J)n-X-R-Y-B Structural formula (10) P-J1-J2-(J-A\u2032m)n-X-R-Y-B Structural formula (11) wherein X, R, Y, B, A\u2032, J, m and n are as defined in structural formula (5) or (6) above, and P, J1 and J2 are as defined in structural formula (9). Particularly, the hydrophilic compound in structural formula (10) and structural formula (11) is preferably bound to the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand of the dengue virus-specific siRNA, and in this case, structural formula (9) to structural formula (11) may correspond to the following structural formula (12) to structural formula (14): wherein X, R, Y, B, A, A\u2032 J, m, n. P, J1 and J2 are as defined in structural formula (9) to structural formula (11) above, and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 represent the 5\u2032 end and 3\u2032 end of the sense strand of the dengue virus-specific siRNA. An amine group that may be used in the present invention may be a primary, secondary or tertiary amine group. Preferably, a primary amine group is used. The introduced amine group may be an amine salt. For example, a salt of the primary amine group may be present as NH3+. In addition, a polyhistidine group that may be used in the present invention preferably comprises 3 to 10 histidines, more preferably 5 to 8 histidines, and most preferably six histidines. In addition to histidines, one or more cysteines may be included. Active targeting using nanoparticles is a technology of binding a targeting moiety to nanoparticles, and it has been reported that the active targeting promotes preferential accumulation of nanoparticles in the target tissue or improves internalization of nanoparticles into the target cells (Does a targeting ligand influence nanoparticle tumor localization or uptake Trends Biotechnol. 2008 October; 26(10):552-8. Epub 2008 Aug. 21). The active targeting is performed using a targeting moiety capable of binding a target cell surface-specific or overexpressed carbohydrate, receptor, or antigen (Nanotechnology in cancer therapeutics: bioconjugated nanoparticles for drug delivery. Mol Cancer Ther 2006; 5(8): 1909-1917). Thus, when a targeting moiety is included in the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA according to the present invention and nanoparticles formed therefrom, it can promote the efficient delivery of the RNA structure into target cells so that the RNA structure can be delivered into the target cells even at a relatively low concentration to exhibit a high effect of regulating the expression of the target gene, and the non-specific delivery of the dengue virus-specific siRNA into other organs and cells can be prevented. Accordingly, the present invention provides a double-stranded oligo RNA structure in which a ligand (L), particularly a ligand having the property of binding specifically to a receptor that enhances target cell internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME), is further bound to the structure represented by any one of structural formulas (1) to (4), (7) and (8). For example, a structure comprising a ligand bound to the double-stranded RNA structure represented by structural formula (1) has a structure as shown in the following structural formula (15): (Li-Z)-A-X-R-Y-B Structural formula (15) wherein A, B, X and Y are as defined in structural formula (1) above, L is a ligand having the property of binding specifically to a receptor that enhances target cell internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME), Z represents a simple covalent bond or a linker that mediates the binding between the ligand and the hydrophilic monomer in the hydrophilic block, and I is an integer ranging from 1 to 5, and preferably from 1 to 3. The ligand in structural formula (15) may preferably be selected from among: target receptor-specific antibodies, aptamers and peptides, which have the RME property of enhancing target cell internalization; folate (the term \u201cfolate\u201d is generally used interchangeably with folic acid, and the term \u201cfolate\u201d as used herein means folate that is a natural form or is activated in the human body); and chemical compounds, including hexoamine such as N-acetyl galactosamine (NAG), and saccharides or carbohydrates such as glucose and mannose, but is not limited thereto. In addition, the hydrophilic compound A in structural formula (15) above may be used in the form of the hydrophilic block represented by structural formula (5) or (6). In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA. For example, the method for preparing the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA may comprise the steps of: (1) binding a hydrophilic compound to a solid support; (2) synthesizing a RNA single strand on the hydrophilic compound-bound solid support; (3) covalently binding a hydrophobic compound to the 5\u2032 end of the RNA single strand; (4) synthesizing a RNA single strand having a sequence complementary to the sequence of the RNA single strand of step (3); (5) separating and purifying a RNA-polymer structure and the RNA single strand from the solid support after completion of the synthesis; and (6) annealing the prepared RNA-polymer structure with the RNA single strand having the complementary sequence. The solid support that is used in the present invention is preferably controlled pore glass (CPG), but is not limited thereto, polystyrene, silica gel, cellulose paper or the like may also be used. If CPG is used, it preferably has a diameter of 40-180 \u03bcm and a pore size of 500-3000 \u212b. After step (5), the molecular weights of the prepared and purified RNA-polymer structure and RNA single strand can be measured by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in order to confirm whether the desired RNA-polymer structure and RNA single strand were prepared. In the above-described preparation method, step (4) of synthesizing the RNA single strand having a sequence complementary to the sequence of the RNA single strand synthesized in step (2) may be performed before step (1) or during any one step of steps (1) to (5). In addition, the RNA single strand having a sequence complementary to the sequence of the RNA single strand synthesized in step (2) may be used in a state in which a phosphate group is bound to the 5\u2032 end of the RNA single strand. Meanwhile, the present invention provides a method for preparing a double-stranded oligo RNA structure further comprising a ligand bound to the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA. For example, the ligand-bound oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA may comprise the steps of: (1) binding a hydrophilic compound to a solid support having a functional group bound thereto; (2) synthesizing a RNA single strand on the solid support having the functional group and hydrophilic compound bound thereto; (3) covalently binding a hydrophobic compound to the 5\u2032 end of the RNA single strand; (4) synthesizing a RNA single strand having a sequence complementary to the sequence of the RNA single strand synthesized in step (2); (5) separating the functional group-RNA-polymer structure and the RNA single strand having the complementary sequence from the solid support after completion of the synthesis; (6) binding a ligand to the end of the hydrophilic compound by the functional group to prepare a ligand-RNA-polymer structure single strand; and (7) annealing the prepared ligand-RNA-polymer structure with the RNA single strand having the complementary sequence. After step (6), the prepared the prepared ligand-RNA-polymer structure and the RNA single strand having the complementary sequence may be separated and purified, and then the molecular weights thereof may be measured by a MALDI-TOF mass analyzer in order to confirm whether the desired ligand-RNA-polymer structure and the desired RNA single strand having the complementary sequence were prepared. By annealing the prepared ligand-RNA-polymer structure with the RNA single strand having the complementary sequence, a ligand-double stranded oligo RNA structure can be prepared. In the above-described preparation method, step (4) of synthesizing the RNA single strand having a sequence complementary to the sequence of the RNA single strand synthesized in step (3) may be performed before step (1) or during any one step of steps (1) to (6). In still another aspect, the present invention provides nanoparticles comprising the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA. As described above, the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the dengue virus-specific siRNA is an amphiphilic structure comprising both the hydrophobic compound and the hydrophilic compound, in which the hydrophilic moiety is oriented toward of the structure by interactions (such as hydrogen bonds) with water molecules in vivo, and the hydrophobic compound moieties are oriented toward the inside of the structure by hydrophobic interactions therebetween to thereby form thermodynamically stable nanoparticles. In other words, the hydrophobic compound is located in the center of the nanoparticles, and the hydrophilic compound is located on the outside of the dengue virus-specific siRNA to cover the dengue virus-specific siRNA, thereby forming nanoparticles. The nanoparticles formed as described above enhance the intracellular delivery of the dengue virus-specific siRNA and enhances siRNA efficiency.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to examples. It will be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art that these examples are illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed to limit or change the scope of the present invention. Example 1 Design of Target Nucleotide Sequence of Dengue Virus and Preparation of siRNA Dengue virus serotype 4 (bank accession No. KBPV-VR-31) obtained from the Korea Bank for Pathogenic Viruses (Korea) was transfected into VeroE6 cells, and after 4 days, cell pellets were harvested. RNA was prepared using a Qiagen RNA prep kit and quantified, and then cDNA was synthesized from 2 \u03bcg of the total RNA using an AccuPower Rocketscript\u2122 RT Premix (Bioneer, Korea). The obtained cDNA was sequenced, and as a result, it was found that the sequence of the cDNA was consistent with the total nucleotide sequence of the dengue virus serotype 4 strain H241 (GenBank: AY947539.1), except for 11 nucleotides and 6 amino acids. Based on such sequencing results, highly scored siRNAs and additional siRNAs selected so as to be uniformly distributed in functional proteins were combined using the siRNA design algorithms of the following four bio companies on the H241 nucleotide sequence, thereby designing a total of 50 siRNAs as shown in Table 2 below. Bioneer: http:\/\/10.10.10.46:8080\/siRNA2\/menuDesigner.jsf; Invitrogen: https:\/\/rnaidesigner.invitrogen.com\/rnaiexpress; Genscript: https:\/\/www.genscript.com\/ssl-bin\/gs_login; ThermoScientific: http:\/\/www.thermoscientificbio.com\/design-center\/-redirect=true) Next, the sequences of the 5\u2032-UTR region and 3\u2032-UTR region of the genome sequences of about 60 dengue virus strains belonging to four serotypes were multialigned to compare the homology, thereby obtaining a conserved sequence region having high homology (FIGS. 1 and 2). Thus, 6 universal siRNAs targeting the region were additionally constructed as shown in Table 3 below. The relative positions of these siRNAs are shown in FIG. 3.

The siRNA was prepared by connecting the phosphodiester bonds of the RNA backbone structure using \u03b2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite (Nucleic Acids Research, 12:4539-4557, 1984). Specifically, a series of processes including deblocking, coupling, oxidation and capping were repeated on a nucleotide-bound solid support using a RNA synthesizer (384 Synthesizer, BIONEER, KOREA), thereby obtaining a reaction product comprising a RNA having a desired length. The RNA was separated and purified from the reaction product by HPLC LC918 (Japan Analytical Industry, Japan) equipped with a Daisogel C18 column (Daiso, Japan), and was analyzed by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) to confirm whether it was consistent with the desired nucleotide sequence. Next, the sense and antisense RNA strands were bound to each other, thereby preparing a double-stranded siRNA comprising a sense strand having a sequence selected from among the sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 56 and 89.

After dengue virus infection, the viral culture was collected at 24-hr intervals and centrifuged (6000 rpm, 5 min, 4\u00b0 C.). From 400 \u03bcl of the culture, RNA was prepared using an ExiPrep\u2122 16DX RNA prep system. Of a total of 50 \u03bcl of the eluted RNA, 19.5 \u03bcl was used for cDNA synthesis, and of a total of 20 \u03bcl of the cDNA, 5 \u03bcl was used for qPCR. Among the dengue virus serotypes used, serotype 2 to serotype 4 were obtained from the Korea Bank for Pathogenic Viruses (Korea), and serotype 1 was obtained from the Department of Virology, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2.2: Examination of Viral Copy Number From a total of 400 \u03bcl of the collected culture media, RNA was extracted using Exiprep Dx\u2122 (Bioneer, Korea) system. Using this system, about 50 \u03bcl of RNA per 400 \u03bcl of the culture media was obtained. Then, 0.5 \u03bcl of an antisense primer (100 pM\/\u03bcl) having the primer sequence shown in Table 5 below and 19.5 \u03bcl of the prepared RNA were reacted using AccuPower\u00ae CycleScript RT PreMix (Bioneer, Korea) at 50\u00b0 C. for 1 hr and at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 min, thereby obtaining a total of 20 \u03bcl of a cDNA sample for each virus serotype. Then, for qPCR, the detection of serotypes 1 to 3 was performed using DN1234_S, DN123_AS and DN123_probe, and the detection of serotype 4 was performed using DN1234_S, DN4_AS and DN4_probe. In the qPCR reaction, AccuPower\u00ae Plus DualStar\u2122 qPCR PreMix (Bioneer, Korea) was used, and 0.3 \u03bcl (based on 100 pM\/\u03bcl stock) of each of the primer and the probe, 5 \u03bcl of cDNA and 44.1 \u03bcl of dH2O were added to a total of 50 \u03bcl of a reaction volume and mixed by vortexing for about 3-5 minutes. The reaction was performed using Exicycler\u2122 96 Real-Time Quantitative Thermal Block (Bioneer, Korea) at 95\u00b0 C. for 10 min and for 45 cycles (95\u00b0 C. for 5 sec, and 60\u00b0 C. for 5 sec, and the fluorescence value was detected after each cycle. Based on the results obtained after the qPCR array, the viral copy number of each sample and the relative amount (%) of residual virus were calculated.

Based on the averaged values, the qPCR results were graphically shown. As a result, the copy numbers of serotypes 2, 3 and 4 in the C6\/36 cell line increased rapidly up to 72 hours after infection, and then were maintained (FIG. 4). In the case of the VeroE6 cell line, it was observed that the copy numbers of serotypes 2 and 3 increased rapidly up to 72 hours after infection, and then were maintained, and the copy number of serotype 4 gradually increased up to 144 hours (FIG. 5). Thus, for virus replication, the virus was collected at 7 days after infection, and for evaluation of siRNA efficacy, the culture medium was collected at day 3 when the virus replication reached the peak point. Although the results of quantitative measurement of the copy number of serotype 1 were not described in the specification, serotype 1 was used in the Examples under the same conditions according to the same method as other serotypes. Example 3 Examination of the Ability of Primarily Selected siRNAs to Inhibit Dengue Virus Replication 3.1: siRNA Transfection and Virus Infection VeroE6 cells were transfected with 56 kinds of siRNAs constructed in Example 1, and the copy number of virus in the transfected cell line was analyzed to determine the performance of the siRNAs. 24 hours before siRNA transfection, VeroE6 cells were seeded into a 12-well plate (Nunc, USA) at a density of 1\u00d7105 cells\/well. The cells were cultured using 1 ml\/well of a complete medium of DMEM (Hyclone, USA) under the conditions of 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2. The complete medium composition was obtained by adding 4.00 mM of L-gutamine and 4500 mg\/L of glucose, sodium pyruvate and fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, USA) to 500 ml of Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 10%. After 24 hours, for siRNA transfection, the medium in the 12-well plate was replaced with 500 \u03bcl of OPTI-MEM (GIBCO, USA), and the cells were pre-incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0 C. Each of a mixture of 3.5 \u03bcl of LipofectamineRNAimax (Invitrogen, USA) reagent and 250 \u03bcl of OPTI-MEM and 250 \u03bcl of OPTI-MEM containing at various concentrations of the siRNA diluted therein was prepared, and then allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes, after which the OPTI-MEM containing the siRNA diluted therein was added to the LipofectamineRNAimax-containing OPTI-MEM and incubated at room temperature for about 20 minutes. The incubated medium was transfected into cells. After about 6 hours, the medium was washed out and exchanged with complete DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, and the cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the medium was washed out, and then the prepared virus soup (about 1.0\u00d7108 copies\/ml) was 2-fold diluted and controlled to more than 1\u00d7107 copies per 200 \u03bcl. 200 \u03bcl of the dilution was added to each well, and then rocked at 30-min intervals for 2 hours to promote the application of the virus, and then 1 ml of 2% FBS-containing DMEM medium (virus growth medium) was added thereto and incubated before an assay was performed. After about 3 days, RNA was extracted from the harvested cell culture medium and the virus copy number was measured. 3.2: Examination of the Ability of 56 siRNAs to Inhibit Dengue Virus Serotype 4 To select candidates having the ability to inhibit the replication of virus serotype 4 from a total of 56 designed siRNA candidates (Tables 2 and 3), treatment with 20 nM of the siRNA was performed, followed by a screening experiment. In each experiment, the residual virus value of the siRNA siCONT control group was set at 100%, the residual virus values of the siRNA candidates were expressed as value relative thereto for comparison. As a result, as can be seen in FIG. 6, 30 or more siRNAs showed a residual virus value of less than 15%, suggesting that these have a high ability to inhibit dengue virus. Accordingly, 23 siRNA candidates (SiRNA#4, SiRNA#5, SiRNA#6, SiRNA#7, SiRNA#8, SiRNA#13, SiRNA#16, SiRNA#20, SiRNA#22, SiRNA#23, SiRNA#29, SiRNA#32, SiRNA#34, SiRNA#39, SiRNA#40, SiRNA#41, SiRNA#42, SiRNA#44, SiRNA#45, SiRNA#46, SiRNA#47, SiRNA#51, and SiRNA#52) showing a high ability to inhibit dengue virus at a concentration of 20 nM were primarily selected. The primarily selected siRNA candidates were siRNAs having sense strands having the sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 8, 13, 16, 20, 22, 23, 29, 32, 34, 39 to 42, 44 to 47, 51 and 52, respectively (Tables 2 and 3). In the present invention, siRNA of \u201cSiRNA#X\u201d means a siRNA comprising a sense strand having a sequence represented by SiRNA#X in Tables 2, 3 and 6. 3.3: Analysis of the Ability of Primarily Selected Five siRNA Candidates to Inhibit Dengue Virus Serotype 4 In order to verify whether the 23 siRNA candidates selected in Example 3.2 above have an inhibitory effect on the replication of dengue virus serotype 4, a screening experiment by treatment with 5 nM of the siRNA was performed, thereby selecting five siRNA candidates (SiRNA#4, SiRNA#16, SiRNA#22, SiRNA#51, and SiRNA#52). Then, in order to confirm whether the selected five siRNAs have an inhibitory effect on the replication of all dengue virus serotypes, the inhibitory effect on the replication of dengue virus serotype 4 was examined by treatment with 10 nM of the siRNA. Herein, siRNA (UnisiRNA-sh) having the same sequence as that of shRNA described in Korrapati A B et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 6(7):e1735, 2012 was used as a positive control. As a result, it was shown that the selected five siRNA candidates (SiRNA#4, SiRNA#16, SiRNA#22, SiRNA#51, and SiRNA#52) had excellent dengue virus replication inhibitory ability compared to UnisiRNA-sh (FIG. 7). In addition, in order to examine whether the finally selected five siRNA candidates (SiRNA#4, SiRNA#16, SiRNA#22, SiRNA#51, and SiRNA#52) have a dose-dependent effect on the inhibition of replication of dengue virus serotype 4, a screening experiment was performed at four concentrations of 20 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM and 1 nM. As a result, the five siRNA candidates mostly showed a residual virus value of about 10% at a concentration of 5 nM or more, particularly 10 nM or more, suggesting that these have virus inhibitory ability. However, it could be seen that, when the concentration was reduced to 1 nM, the inhibitory ability decreased. Through this experiment, it could be seen that the five siRNAs all showed high inhibitory ability when they were used at a concentration of 10 nM or higher (FIG. 8). 3.4: Analysis of Inhibitory Effects of Primarily Selected Five siRNAs on Each Dengue Virus Serotype In order to examine whether the primarily selected five siRNA candidates show inhibitory ability against each dengue virus serotype, each screening experiment was performed using four dengue virus serotypes. As a result, it was shown that when the experiment was performed at a siRNA concentration of 10 nM, SiRNA#51 and SiRNA#52 showed high inhibitory ability against most of the serotypes, and the remaining three siRNAs showed insignificant inhibitory ability against the serotypes except for serotype 4 (FIG. 9). Examples 4 Preparation of Secondary Universal siRNAs by Single Nucleotide Sliding Window Scanning 4.1: Design and Preparation of Secondary siRNAs Based on the sequence of each of SiRNA#51 SiRNA#52 constructed to target a conserved sequence region having high homology to the 5\u2032-UTR region and Cp region of the dengue virus genome, 16 new universal siRNAs (a total of 32 siRNAs) as shown in Table 6 were additionally constructed by a single nucleotide sliding window scanning design method. FIG. 10 shows the relative positions of these siRNAs.

As a result, the experiment group treated with siRNAs of SiRNA#51-14 (SEQ ID NO: 70), SiRNA#51-15 (SEQ ID NO: 71), SiRNA#51-16 (SEQ ID NO: 72), SiRNA#52-4 (SEQ ID NO: 76), SiRNA#52-5 (SEQ ID NO: 77), SiRNA#52-8 (SEQ ID NO: 80), SiRNA#52-9 (SEQ ID NO: 81) and SiRNA#52-10 (SEQ ID NO: 82) showed a residual virus value of less than 1%, suggesting that these siRNAs show a very strong inhibitory ability. This value is a significantly better inhibitory ability value compared to those of previous SiRNA#51 and SiRNA#52. 4.3: Examination of the Ability of Finally Selected Two siRNAs to Inhibit Replication of Dengue Virus Serotypes 2 to 4 Next, among the siRNAs constructed based on the sequences of SiRNA#51 and SiRNA#52 among the siRNA candidates showing strong inhibitory ability, SiRNA#51-15 (SEQ ID NO: 71) and SiRNA#52-10 (SEQ ID NO: 82) having high reproducibility were finally selected, and the inhibitory effects thereof against the replication of dengue virus serotypes 2 to 4 were examined at a concentration of 10 nM. As a result, it could be seen that SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10 showed high inhibitory effects compared to previous SiRNA#51 and SiRNA#52 (FIG. 12). 4.4: Examination of the Effect of Combination of SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10 Against the Replication of Dengue Virus Serotypes 2 to 4 As described above, the two siRNAs (SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10) having better inhibitory ability against the replication of dengue virus serotypes 2, 3 and 4 were selected through the single nucleotide sliding windows scanning experiment. However, based on the fact that a single siRNA cannot be sufficient for use as a universal therapeutic agent for inhibiting the replication of al dengue virus serotypes (SiRNA#51-15 does not show strong inhibitory ability against dengue virus serotype 4), SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10 were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 to prepare a siRNA mixture (hereinafter referred to as \u2018Combi-siRNA\u2019), and a screening experiment was performed at a concentration of 10 nM in order to confirm whether Combi-siRNA can show a strong inhibitory effect by a complementary effect against the replication of all dengue virus serotypes. As a result, it could be seen that Combi-siRNA showed a strong inhibitory effect against the replication of all dengue virus serotypes (FIG. 13). 4.5: Examination of Inhibitory Effect of Combination of SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10 Against the Replication of Dengue Virus Serotypes 2 to 4 in a Pre-Virus Infection Condition Established to Make a Therapeutic Agent Application Environment Caused by Infection in Nature Next, cells cultured in view of a virus infection state caused by mosquitoes were infected with the virus, and then treated with the siRNA, and whether the siRNA can exhibit a therapeutic effect was examined. Specifically, 5 nM of each of the selected two siRNAs (SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10) was added, and 5 nM of siCONT was added thereto to control the final concentration of the siRNA to 10 nM. Also, the cells were treated with Combi-siRNA containing 5 nM of each of the two siRNAs (SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10), and the inhibitory ability of Combi-siRNA was examined. As a result, it was shown that treatment with Combi-siRNA showed strong inhibitory ability against the replication of all dengue virus serotypes (FIG. 14). This suggests that Combi-siRNA can function as a universal therapeutic agent against all dengue virus serotypes. 4.6: Determination of Inhibitor Effect and IC50 Value of Combi-siRNA a Against Replication of all Dengue Virus Serotypes In order to verify whether the finally selected two siRNAs (SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10) and Combi-siRNA have a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the replication of dengue virus JB (serotype 2, Chonbuk National University) and dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4, a screening experiment was performed at four concentrations of 10 nM, 1 nM, 200 pM and 50 pM. As a result, the siRNA candidates showed different dose-dependent inhibitory effects against all dengue virus serotypes (FIG. 15), and showed an IC50 value at a low concentration of 50-200 pM for most virus serotypes except for dengue virus serotype 4. Combi-siRNA showed a better IC50 value compared to the siRNAs (Table 7).

The siRNA sense strand in structural formula (16) above was prepared by synthesizing a double stranded oligo RNA-hydrophilic compound structure having polyethylene glycol bound to the 3\u2032 end region by a method in which the phosphodiester bonds of the RNA backbone structure were connected by \u03b2-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite using a 3\u2032 polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mn=2,000)-CPG support prepared according to the method described in Example 1 of Korean Patent Publication No. 2012-0119212, and then binding a disulfide bond-containing tetradocosane to the 5\u2032 end, thereby preparing a desired RNA-polymer sense strand. The antisense strand to be annealed to the above sense strand was obtained by preparing an antisense strand having a sequence complementary to that of the sense strand using the above-described reaction. After completion of the synthesis, the synthesized RNA single strand and RNA polymer structure were detached from the CPG by treatment with 28% (v\/v) ammonia in water bath at 60\u00b0 C., followed by deprotection to remove the protecting group. The deprotected RNA single strand and RNA-polymer structure were treated with a mixture of N-methylpyrolidon, triethylamine and triethylaminetrihydrofluoride at a volume ratio of 10:3:4 in an oven at 70\u00b0 C. to remove 2\u2032TBDMS (tert-but\u03bcldimethylsilyl). RNA was separated and purified from the reaction product by HPLC LC918 (Japan Analytical Industry, Japan) equipped with a Daisogel C18 column (Daiso, Japan), and analyzed by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) to confirm whether it is consistent with the desired nucleotide sequence. Then, in order to prepare each double-stranded oligo RNA polymer structure, the sense strand was mixed with the same amount of the antisense strand, and the mixture was added to 1\u00d7 annealing buffer (30 mM HEPES, 100 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, pH 7.0-7.5), and allowed to react in water bath at 90\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, and then allowed to react at 37\u00b0 C., thereby preparing double-stranded oligo RNA structures comprising the finally selected five siRNA candidates (SiRNA#4, SiRNA#16, SiRNA#22, SiRNA#51, and SiRNA#52), respectively. It was confirmed by electrophoresis that the prepared double-stranded oligo RNA structures were annealed. The prepared double-stranded oligo RNA structure (SAMiRNA) forms nanoparticles (i.e., micelles) by interactions between the hydrophobic compound moieties bound to the ends of the double-stranded oligo RNAs (FIG. 16). The prepared SAMiRNA was dissolved in 1.5 me of DPBS (D\u03bclbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline) at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg\/ml, and then lyophilized at \u221275\u00b0 C. and 5 mTorr for 48 hours to prepare nanoparticle powder, which was then dissolved in the solvent DPBS to prepare homogeneous nanoparticles, which were used in the Examples of the present invention. 5.2 Analysis of Virus Replication Inhibitory Ability of SAMiRNAs Comprising Primarily Selected Five siRNA Candidates Using the SAMiRNAs prepared by the method of Example 5.1 so as to include the primarily selected five siRNA candidates (SiRNA#4, SiRNA#16, SiRNA#22, SiRNA#51, and SiRNA#52), the inhibitory effects of the SAMiRNAs on the replication of dengue virus serotypes 3 and 4 were analyzed. It was shown that when the SAMiRNAs comprising SiRNA#51 and SiRNA#52 showing high inhibitory ability against all dengue virus serotypes in the above Examples were used, they were delivered into cells at a concentration of about 200 nM or higher and showed high inhibitory ability (70-75%) (FIG. 17). 5.3 Analysis of Reproducibility of Universal Inhibitory Ability of Selected Finally Combi-siRNA Candidate in the Form of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA Unlike the SAMiRNA used in Example 5.2, the hydrophilic compound block [PO3\u2212 hexaethylene glycol]4 was used in place of the hydrophilic compound PEG to prepare a highly stable SAMiRNA comprising both SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018Mono-HEG SAMiRNA\u2019; see structural formula (17)). C24-5\u2032-S-3\u2032-[(Hexa Ethylene Glycol)-PO3\u2212]4 Structural formula (17) wherein S represents the sense strand of the dengue virus-specific siRNA, AS represents the antisense strand of the dengue virus-specific siRNA, Hexa ethylene glycol represents a hydrophilic compound, C24 represents a disulfide-containing tetradocosane that is a hydrophobic compound, and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 represents the direction of the ends of the sense strand in the double-stranded oligo RNA. In order to confirm whether the constructed Mono-HEG SAMiRNA reproducibly shows similar inhibitory abilities against all dengue virus serotypes, screening at a concentration of 500 nM was performed. As a result, it could be seen that treatment with Mono-HEG SAMiRNA reproducibly showed similar inhibitory abilities against all serotype (FIG. 18). 5.4: Analysis of Dose-Dependent Inhibitor Ability and Determination of IC50 of Finally Selected Combi-siRNA Candidates in the Form of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA Combi-siRNA obtained by mixing the finally selected two siRNAs (SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10) at a molar ratio of 1:1 was synthesized in the form of SAMiRNA, and whether the SAMiRNA efficiently inhibits dengue virus replication to 50% even at low concentration in vitro, thereby evaluating the effectiveness of the SAMiRNA as an actual therapeutic agent. Specifically, using Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA comprising both SiRNA#51-15 and SiRNA#52-10, a screening experiment of verifying the effect of inhibiting the replication of all dengue virus serotypes was performed at concentrations of 500 nM, 200 nM and 50 nM. As a result, it could be seen that Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA showed reproducible IC50 values against serotypes except for dengue virus serotype 4 at a concentration of 50-200 nM (FIG. 19 and Table 8). TABLE 8 IC50 value of SAMiRNA comprising Combi- siRNA against each dengue virus serotype IC50 values of each DENV serotype (nM) Serotypes DENV1 DENV2 DENV JB2 DENV3 DENV4 Combi-siRNA <50 <200 <200 <200 <200 Example 6 Comparative Analysis of the Intracellular Uptake and Endosomal Escape Efficiencies of SAMiRNA Carriers Obtained by Introducing Amine Group into SAMiRNA Nanoparticles In order to increase the intracellular delivery efficiency of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA represented by structural formula (17) above, newly modified amine-Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA was synthesized by conjugating an amine group to the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand as shown in the following structural formula (18): wherein S represents the sense strand of the dengue virus-specific siRNA, AS represents the antisense strand of the dengue virus-specific siRNA, Hexa ethylene glycol represents a hydrophilic compound, C6 represents a C6 alkyl linker that connects an amine group to [Hexa Ethylene Glycol]4, C24 represents a disulfide-containing tetradocosane that is a hydrophobic compound, and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 represents the direction of the ends of the sense strand in the double-stranded oligo RNA. The newly synthesized amine-Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA was constructed by conjugating a FITC fluorophore to the 3\u2032 end region of the antisense strand such that an increase in the delivery efficiency thereof by the introduction of the amine group compared to the Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA could be visibly measured by a fluorescence microscope. In this experiment, the time-dependent delivery efficiencies of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA and amine-Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA were randomly captured with the image data obtained a confocal microscope, and the fluorescence was quantitatively measured by a densitometer, thereby confirming whether the delivery efficiency of SAMiRNA was increased by the introduction of the amine group. 6.1: Comparison of Time-Dependent Delivery Efficiency of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-FITC by Comparative Observation of Fluorescence Images Using Confocal Microscope 15 hours before treatment with Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-FITC, HeLa cells were seeded into a 2-chamber polystyrene vessel (BD Falcon\u2122 cultureslides) at a concentration of 2\u00d7105 cells\/ml. The cells were cultured using 1 ml\/chamber of a complete medium of DMEM (Hyclone, USA) under the conditions of 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2. The complete medium composition was obtained by adding 4.00 mM of L-gutamine and 4500 mg\/L of glucose, sodium pyruvate and fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, USA) to 500 ml of Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 10%. After 15 hours of cell culture, the culture medium in the chamber was removed and replaced with 1 ml of OPTI-MEM (GIBCO, USA), and then the cells were treated with 1000 nM of SAMiRNA-FITC under a light-shielded condition at indicated time points (0 hr, 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 3 hr and 12 hr) such that IFA (ImmunoFluorescence Assay) could be performed at the same time. 6.2: Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) for Confocal Microscopy An IFA was performed under a light-shielded condition. The cell culture medium treated with SAMiRNA-FITC was removed from the 2-chamber polystyrene vessel by a 1000 p pipettor, and then the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of OPTI-MEM. Next, the cells were washed once with 1 ml of 1\u00d7PBS for 3 minutes, and then treated with 500 ul of 2% PFA (paraformaldehyde) and fixed at room temperature for 30 minutes. The 2% PFA used herein was prepared freshly, filtered and then freeze dried. After cell fixation, the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of 1\u00d7PBS for 3 minutes each time, and then treated with 500 ul of a blocking solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (USB) and 10% BSA (Albumin, Bovine, pH 7.0) in 1\u00d7PBS, after which the cells were blocked at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then briefly washed once with 1\u00d7PBS after removal of the blocking solution. Next, primary antibody (EEA1(H-300), Santa Cruz, sc-33585) for staining intracellular endosomes was diluted at a ratio of 500:1 (v\/v) in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (USB) and 3% BSA (Albumin, Bovine, pH 7.0) in 1\u00d7PBS, after which the cells were treated 500 ul of the antibody dilution and covered with a foil for 90 minutes, thereby performing primary staining. After primary staining, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of 1\u00d7PBS for 3 times each time. Secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 546 Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Invitrogen Molecular Probes) showing red fluorescence was diluted at a ratio of 1000:1 in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (USB) and 3% BSA (Albumin, Bovine, pH7.0) in 1\u00d7PBS, and then the cells were treated with 500 ul of the secondary antibody dilution and covered with a foil for 90 minutes, thereby performing secondary staining. After secondary staining, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of 1\u00d7PBS for 3 minutes each time, and 500 ul of a 1000:1 (v\/v) dilution of DAPI (DAPI, Dilactate, Sigma, D-9564), 10 mg\/ml in D.W) in 1\u00d7PBS was added to the cells, and the nucleus was stained at room temperature for 20 minutes. Next, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of 1\u00d7PBS for 3 minutes each time, and the chamber wall was detached, and then one drop of mounting medium (IMMU-MOUNT, Thermo Scientific Shandon, cat. NO. 9990402) was dropped on the cells while preventing the entry of air bubbles. Next, the cells were carefully covered with a cover glass, and dried under a light-shield condition using a foil at room temperature for 20 minutes or more until the mounting medium would be hardened. Next, the cells were observed by detecting FITC signal (green) and Alexa546 (red) signal using a confocal microscope (LSM700, Carl Zeiss), followed by image data analysis. 6.3: Analysis of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-FITC Image Data by Confocal Microscope Using a confocal microscope, 2D images at 400\u00d7 magnification were acquired at varying time points (0 hr, 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 3 hr, and 12 hr), and 3D images of the cells were obtained by z-stacking at 1000\u00d7 magnification. The 2D and 3D images were analyzed to determine whether the merge of the FITC signal and the Alexa546 signal occurred (co-localization of SAMiRNA-FITC nanoparticles to endosomes) and whether the FITC signal was located in the intracellular cytoplasm. The images obtained by the confocal microscope were analyzed by ZEN 2009 light edition (Carl Zeiss) software. As a result, it was shown that, in the case of amine-Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA comprising an amine group, the FITC signal that appeared as large spots in the initial stage appeared as small spots with the passage of time after treatment, and the amine-Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA was present in the cytoplasm in a larger amount than Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA (FIG. 20). 6.4: Quantitative Analysis of FITC Fluorescence Value of Cells at Varying Time Points by Densitometer Software At early time points (0 min, 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min) after treatment with FITC-labeled SAMiRNA, 6-cut 2D images were obtained at 200\u00d7 magnification using a confocal microscope, and then the FITC fluorescence value of each image at each time point was quantified using Image J densitometer software, thereby comparatively analyzing the delivery efficiency of SAMiRNA-FITC at each time point between the presence and absence of the amine group. As a result, it could be seen that the time-dependent fluorescence value of amine-Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA was higher than that of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA (FIG. 21). The above experimental results suggest that the introduction of the amine group can further increase the intracellular delivery efficiency of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA. 6.5: Comparative Experiment on the Universal Ability of Modified Amine-Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-DN Combi to Inhibit Dengue Virus Replication Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-DN Combi, a new type of therapeutic agent, was synthesized by introducing an amine group into Combi-SAMiRNA, and was subjected to a screening experiment at a concentration of 500 nM in order to confirm whether it has a significant difference from Combi-SAMiRNA with respect to the ability to inhibit the replication of each dengue virus serotype.","cpc_label":"C12N151131","ipc_label":"C12N15113","filing_date":"20160101","patent_issue_date":"20170704","date_published":"20160526","examiner_id":"71334.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention relates to a dengue virus-specific siRNA, a double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprising the siRNA, and a composition for inhibiting dengue virus replication, which comprises the same, in which the double-stranded oligo RNA structure comprises a hydrophilic compound and hydrophobic compound conjugated to both ends of the double-stranded RNA (siRNA) by a single covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond so as to be efficiently delivered into cells, and can be converted into nanoparticles by hydrophobic interactions between the double-stranded oligo RNA structures in an aqueous solution., in the context of the novelty:  The present invention relates to a dengue virus-specific siRNA, a double-stranded oligo RNA structure .

The produced 3-buten-2-one can, e.g., be further converted in 3-buten-2-ol and finally into 1,3-butadiene. Butadiene (1,3-butadiene) is a conjugated diene with the formula C4H6. It is an important industrial chemical used as a monomer in the production of synthetic rubber. There exist different possibilities to produce butadiene. Butadiene is, for example, produced as a by product of the steam cracking process used to produce ethylene and other olefins. In this process butadiene occurs in the C4 stream and is normally isolated from other by-products by extraction into a polar aprotic solvent, such as acetonitrile, from which it is then stripped. Butadiene can also be produced by the catalytic dehydrogenation of normal butane or it can be produced from ethanol. In the latter case, two different processes are in use. In a single-step process, ethanol is converted to butadiene, hydrogen and water at 400-450\u00b0 C. over a metal oxide catalyst (Kirshenbaum, I. (1978), Butadiene. In M. Grayson (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd ed., Vol. 4, pp. 313-337. New York: John Wiley & Sons). In a two-step process, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde which reacts with additional ethanol over a tantalum-promoted porous silica catalyst at 325-350\u00b0 C. to yield butadiene (Kirshenbaum, I. (1978), loc cit.). Butadiene can also be produced by catalytic dehydrogenation of normal butenes. For the past two decades, genetic engineering technologies have made possible the modification of the metabolism of microorganisms, and hence their use to produce key substances which they would otherwise produce at a low yield. By enhancing naturally occurring metabolic pathways, these technologies open up new ways to bio-produce numerous compounds of industrial relevance. Several industrial compounds such as amino acids for animal feed, biodegradable plastics or textile fibres are now routinely produced using genetically modified organisms. There are presently attempts to provide also bio-processes using genetically modified microorganisms for the large-scale production of the major petrochemically derived molecules, in particular butadiene, since no microorganisms are known as natural producers of butadiene even in small quantities. Given the large amounts of rubber produced worldwide and the increasing environmental concerns and the limited resources for producing 1,3-butadiene using chemical processes, there is a need to provide alternative, environmentally-friendly and sustainable processes for the production of 1,3-butadiene and its precursor molecules acetoacetyl-CoA, 4-hydroxy-2-butanone, 3-buten-2-ol and, in particular, 3-buten-2-one. WO 2012\/174439 describes methods for producing butadiene from butanols by enzymes which are able to catalyze the conversion of butanols to butadiene. Moreover, WO 2010\/144746 describes non-naturally occurring microbial organism having an exogenous nucleic acid encoding a 3-oxobutanol dehydratase which is capable of dehydrating 1,3-oxobutanol to form butanone. However, given the importance of being able to produce compounds such as 1,3-butadiene by microorganisms, there is still a need to identify alternative routes or mechanisms for producing such compounds from renewable resources. The present invention addresses this need and provides a process by which 3-buten-2-one (also referred to as methyl vinyl ketone) can be produced enzymatically starting from 4-hydroxy-2-butanone by employing certain enzymes. 3-buten-2-one can then further be converted enzymatically to 3-buten-2-ol which can then be further enzymatically converted to 1,3-butadiene. 4-hydroxy-2-butanone can be produced enzymatically from acetoacetyl-CoA while acetoacetyl-CoA can be provided starting from the metabolic intermediate acetyl-Coenzyme A (in the following also referred to as acetyl-CoA) as described herein. The corresponding reactions are schematically shown in FIG. 1. Thus, the present invention relates to a method for the production of 3-buten-2-one comprising the enzymatic conversion of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone into 3-buten-2-one by making use of an enzyme catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration. Enzymes catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration which can be employed in this reaction are the following enzymes which are all classified as E.C. 4.2.1._(i.e., hydro-lyases). Enzymes catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration are enzymes which catalyze the following reaction: The term \u201cdehydration\u201d is generally referred to a reaction involving the removal of H2O. According to the present invention an enzyme catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration is selected from the group consisting of the following enzymes (a) to (i): (a) a 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.116), (b) a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.55), (c) an enoyl-CoA hydratase (EC 4.2.1.17), (d) a 3-hydroxyoctanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.59), (e) a crotonyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydratase (EC 4.2.1.58), (f) a 3-hydroxydecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.60), (g) a 3-hydroxypalmitoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.61), (h) a long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase (EC 4.2.1.74), and (i) a 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase (EC 4.2.1.18). All these enzymes which are capable of catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration have in common that they use a natural substrate having the following minimal structural motif: wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group or CH2COO\u2212, R2 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; and R3 is coenzyme A or acyl-carrier protein. Thus, the above mentioned enzymes which can catalyze the dehydration of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone can be divided into two groups as follows: I.

The accession number for these enzymes in the Pfam database is PF00378 (http:\/\/pfam.sanger.ac.uk\/family\/PF00378). In one embodiment of the method according to the invention the conversion of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone into 3-buten-2-one is achieved by the use of a 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.116). 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratases (EC 4.2.1.116) catalyze the following reaction: The enzyme is known from various bacteria and archae.

As shown in the appended Examples, it was found that different tested 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratases from different organisms are capable of using 4-hydroxy-2-butanone as a substrate and converting it into 3-buten-2-one. Thus, in principle any 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase can be employed in the method according to the invention. However, it is not only possible to employ in the method of the invention a 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase for converting 4-hydroxy-2-butanone into 3-buten-2-one but also enzymes which show the structural and functional similarities as described above, i.e. enzymes as listed in items (b) to (f), above. Thus, in another embodiment of the method according to the invention the conversion of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone into 3-buten-2-one is achieved by the use of a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.55). 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratases (EC 4.2.1.55) catalyze the following reaction: This reaction corresponds to a Michael elimination. 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds.

Although this gene was annotated as a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase, Li et al. (loc. cit.) showed that its natural substrate is 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA. In a particularly preferred embodiment any protein can be employed in a method according to the present invention which comprises an amino acid as shown in SEQ ID NO:25 or an amino acid sequence which is at least x % homologous SEQ ID NO: 25 and which has the activity of a 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase\/3-hydromethylglutaryl-CoA dehydratase and which shows the activity of converting 4-hydroxy-2-butanone into 3-buten-2-one, with x being an integer between 30 and 100, preferably 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99. As described above, the 4-hydroxy-2-butanone to be converted into 3-buten-2-one can be provided by the enzymatic conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone. Thus, the present invention also relates to a method for the production of 3-buten-2-one comprising the enzymatic conversion of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone into 3-buten-2-one by making use of an enzyme catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration as described above wherein said method further comprises the enzymatic conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA into said 4-hydroxy-2-butanone by making use of an acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. The enzymatic conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone by making use of an acetoacetyl-CoA reductase may be accomplished by a two step conversion which comprises (1) the enzymatic conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA into acetoacetaldehyde and (2) the subsequent enzymatic conversion of acetoacetaldehyde into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone. The first step may occur according to the following scheme: Acetoacetyl-CoA+NADH+H+Acetoacetaldehyde+NAD+ or Acetoacetyl-CoA+NADPH+H+Acetoacetaldehyde+NADP+ The second step may occur according to the following scheme: Acetoacetaldehyde+NADH+H+4-Hydroxy-2-butanone+NAD+ or Acetoacetaldehyde+NADPH+H+4-Hydroxy-2-butanone+NADP+ In principle any enzyme which can catalyze such a conversion can be employed. Examples for corresponding enzymes are hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) or short-chain dehydrogenases\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase. Thus, in one embodiment of the method according to the invention the conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone is achieved by employing a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34). This enzyme normally catalyzes the following reaction (S)-3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA+2NADPH+H+(R)-mevalonate+CoA+2NADP+ Enzymes belonging to this class and catalyzing the above shown conversion occur in organisms of all kingdoms, i.e. plants, animals, fungi, bacteria etc. and have extensively been described in the literature. Nucleotide and\/or amino acid sequences for such enzymes have been determined for numerous organisms, in particular bacterial organisms. In principle, any hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) which can catalyze the conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone can be used in the context of the present invention. Alternatively or in addition, the above described conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone can also be achieved by using an enzyme referred to as a short-chain dehydrogenases\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase. The term \u201cshort-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase\u201d or \u201cshort-chain dehydrogenases\/reductase (SDR)\u201d in the context of the present invention refers to enzymes which are characterized by the following features: 1. They catalyze a two-step reaction in which fatty acyl-CoA is reduced to fatty alcohol. 2. They show a substrate specificity for acyl-CoA containing an aliphatic chain from 8 to 20 carbon atoms. Preferably such enzymes are furthermore characterized by the feature that they show a specific motif in their primary structure, i.e. amino acid sequence, namely they show two specific glycine motifs for NADP(H) binding. The short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase or short-chain dehydrogenases\/reductases (SDR) enzymes constitute a family of enzymes, most of which are known to be NAD- or NADP-dependent oxidoreductase (Jornvall H. et al., Biochemistry 34 (1995), 6003-6013). Recently, a novel bacterial NADP-dependent reductase from Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 was characterized (Willis et al., Biochemistry 50 (2011), 10550-10558). This enzyme catalyzes the four-electron reduction of fatty acyl-CoA substrates to the corresponding fatty alcohols. The enzymatic conversion of fatty acyl-CoA into fatty alcohol occurs through an aldehyde intermediate according to the following scheme: The enzyme displays activity on fatty acyl-CoA substrates ranging from 8 to 20 carbons in length (both saturated and unsaturated) as well as on fatty aldehyde substrates. Characteristically, proteins of this family possess two NAD(P)(H)-binding motifs, which have the conserved sequence GXGX(1-2X)G (Willis et al., Biochemistry 50 (2011), 10550-10558; Jornvall H. et al., Biochemistry 34 (1995), 6003-6013). The first pattern, GTGFIG, is identified near the N-terminus and the second signature sequence, GXXXGXG, is located between residues 384-390. In principle any \u201cshort-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase\u201d or \u201cshort-chain dehydrogenases\/reductases (SDR)\u201d can be applied in the method according to the invention. Preferably, the short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase is a short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase from a marine bacterium, preferably from the genus Marinobacter or Hahella, even more preferably from the species Marinobacter aquaeolei, more preferably Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8, Marinobacter manganoxydans, Marinobacter algicola, Marinobacter sp. ELB17 or Hahella chejuensis. Examples of such enzymes are the short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase from Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 (Uniprot accession number A1U3L3, Willis et al., Biochemistry 50 (2011), 10550-10558), the short-chain dehydrogenase from Marinobacter manganoxydans (Uniprot accession number G6YQS9), the short-chain dehydrogenase from Marinobacter algicola (Uniprot accession number A6EUH6), the short-chain dehydrogenase from Marinobacter sp. ELB17 (Uniprot accession number A3JCC5) and the short-chain dehydrogenase from Hahella chejuensis (Uniprot accession number Q2SCE0).

The sequence of the short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase from Marinobacter sp. Bss20148 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 20. The sequence of the short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase from Marinobacter adhaerens (strain HP15) is shown in SEQ ID NO: 21. The sequence of the short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase from Marinobacter santoriniensis NKSG1 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 22. The sequence of the short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase from Marinobacter lipolyticus SM19 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 23. The sequence of the short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase from Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus ATCC 49840 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 24. In a particularly preferred embodiment any protein can be employed in a method according to the present invention which shows an amino acid sequence as shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 7 to 11 and SEQ ID NOs: 20 to 24 or an amino acid sequence which is at least x % homologous to any of SEQ ID NOs: 7 to 11 and SEQ NOs: 20 to 24 and which has the activity of a short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase, i.e., an activity of converting acetoacetyl-CoA into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone, with x being an integer between 30 and 100, preferably 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99. As is evident from the appended Examples, it was found that different tested short-chain dehydrogenase\/reductase proteins from different organisms are capable of using acetoacetyl-CoA as a substrate and converting it into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone. The present invention also relates to a method as described herein above, in which acetoacetyl-CoA is converted into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone which is then further converted into 3-buten-2-one and which further comprises the step of enzymatically providing the acetoacetyl-CoA. This can be achieved by the enzymatic conversion of two molecules acetyl-CoA into one molecule of acetoacetyl-CoA. Such methods have already been described, e.g., in WO 2013\/057194. Thus, according to the present invention, acetyl-CoA can, for example, be converted into acetoacetyl-CoA by the following reaction: 2 acetyl-CoAacetoacetyl-CoA+CoA This reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferases which are classified as EC 2.3.1.9. Enzymes belonging to this class and catalyzing the above shown conversion of two molecules of acetyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA and CoA occur in organisms of all kingdoms, i.e. plants, animals, fungi, bacteria etc. and have extensively been described in the literature. Nucleotide and\/or amino acid sequences for such enzymes have been determined for a variety of organisms, like Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, E. coli, Bacillus subtilis and Candida, to name just some examples. In principle, any acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.9) can be used in the context of the present invention. Alternatively, the provision of acetoacetyl-CoA may also be achieved by the enzymatic conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA according to the following reaction. acetyl-CoA+malonyl-CoA\u2192acetoacetyl-CoA+CoA+CO2 This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called acetoacetyl-CoA synthase (EC 2.3.1.194). The gene encoding this enzyme was identified in the mevalonate pathway gene cluster for terpenoid production in a soil-isolated Gram-positive Streptomyces sp. Strain CL190 (Okamura et al., PNAS USA 107 (2010), 11265-11270, 2010). Moreover a biosynthetic pathway using this enzyme for acetoacetyl-CoA production was recently developed in E. coli (Matsumoto K et al., Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem, 75 (2011), 364-366). Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, in the methods of the invention further comprising the enzymatic conversion of acetyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA, the enzymatic conversion of acetyl-CoA into said acetoacetyl-CoA consists of a single enzymatic reaction in which acetyl-CoA is directly converted into acetoacetyl-CoA. Preferably, the enzymatic conversion of acetyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA is achieved by making use of an acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.9) as described above. In another preferred embodiment, in the methods of the invention further comprising the enzymatic conversion of acetyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA, the enzymatic conversion of acetyl-CoA into said acetoacetyl-CoA comprises two enzymatic steps of (i) enzymatically converting acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA; and (ii) enzymatically converting malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA. Preferably, the enzymatic conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA is achieved by the use of an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2). This enzyme catalyzes the following reaction: Acetyl-CoA+ATP+CO2\u2192Malonyl-CoA+ADP Preferably, the enzymatic conversion of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA is achieved by the use of an acetoacetyl-CoA synthase (EC 2.3.1.194). In principle, any acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.9), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) and\/or acetoacetyl-CoA synthase (EC 2.3.1.194) can be applied in the method according to the invention. The 3-buten-2-one produced according to any method as described herein can be further converted into 3-buten-2-ol, which in itself may serve as a substrate for the production of 1,3-butadiene as described further below. Thus, a method according to the present invention as described above may further include the step of the enzymatic conversion of the produced 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol by making use of a 3-buten-2-one reductase. Enzymes which can act as a 3-buten-2-one reductase, are, e.g., enzymes which are classified as EC 1.1.1 or enzymes which can be classified into E.C. 1.1.1 due to their characteristics, such as short-chain dehydrogenases\/fatty acyl-CoA reductases, in particular those from marine bacteria. In principle any possible enzyme classified in EC 1.1.1 which can catalyze the conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol can be employed in a method according to the invention. Examples of preferred enzymes are alcohol dehydrogenases, such as alcohol dehydrogenases classified as EC 1.1.1.1, alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) classified as EC 1.1.1.2 and allyl alcohol dehydrogenases classified as EC 1.1.1.54, as well as carbonyl reductases (EC 1.1.1.184).

In one preferred embodiment, the 3-buten-2-one reductase catalyzing the enzymatic conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol is an alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1). In principle, any alcohol dehydrogenase classified as EC 1.1.1.1 which can catalyze the conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol can be employed in a method according to the present invention. Alcohol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.1) are a group of dehydrogenase enzymes that occur in many organisms and facilitate the interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones with the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ to NADH). In humans and many other animals, they serve to break down alcohols that otherwise are toxic, and they also participate in generation of useful aldehyde, ketone, or alcohol groups during biosynthesis of various metabolites. In yeast, plants, and many bacteria, some alcohol dehydrogenases catalyze the opposite reaction as part of fermentation to ensure a constant supply of NAD+. Enzymes belonging to this class and catalyzing the above shown conversion occur in organisms of all kingdoms, i.e. plants, animals, fungi, bacteria etc. and have extensively been described in the literature. For example, enzymes from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Sacharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosasccharomyces pombe, Rhodobacter ruber, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Brassica napus have been identified and characterized. Nucleotide and\/or amino acid sequences for such enzymes have been determined for numerous organisms, in particular bacterial organisms. In principle, any alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) which can catalyze the conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol can be used in the context of the present invention. Indeed, as exemplified in the examples, it was found that different tested alcohol dehydrogenases from different organisms are capable of using 3-buten-2-one as a substrate and converting it into 3-buten-2-ol. In another embodiment, the 3-buten-2-one reductase catalyzing the enzymatic conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol is an alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.2). In principle, any alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) classified as EC 1.1.1.2 which can catalyze the conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol can be employed in a method according to the present invention. Alcohol dehydrogenases (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.2) are a group of dehydrogenase enzymes that occur in many organisms and facilitate the interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones with the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADP+ to NADPH). Enzymes belonging to this class and catalyzing the above shown conversion occur in organisms of all kingdoms, i.e. plants, animals, fungi, bacteria etc. and have extensively been described in the literature. For example, enzymes from Bos taurus, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Lactobacillus brevis, Escherichia coli, Sacharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster have been identified and characterized. Nucleotide and\/or amino acid sequences for such enzymes have been determined for numerous organisms. In principle, any alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.2) which can catalyze the conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol can be used in the context of the present invention.

In another preferred embodiment, the conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol is achieved by employing an allyl alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.54). Allyl alcohol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.54) catalyze the following reaction: In principle, any allyl alcohol dehydrogenase classified as EC 1.1.1.54 which can catalyze the conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol can be employed in a method according to the present invention. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH\u2014OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is often referred to as allyl-alcohol:NADP+ oxidoreductase.

For example, enzymes from Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli have been identified and characterized. In principle, any allyl alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.54) which can catalyze the conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol can be used in the context of the present invention. In another preferred embodiment, the 3-buten-2-one reductase catalyzing the enzymatic conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol is a carbonyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.184). A carbonyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.184) catalyzes the following reaction: Ketone+NADPH+H+secondary alcohol+NADP+ This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH\u2014OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is secondary-alcohol:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include aldehyde reductase 1, prostaglandin 9-ketoreductase, xenobiotic ketone reductase, NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase, ALR3, carbonyl reductase, nonspecific NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase, aldehyde reductase 1, and carbonyl reductase (NADPH). This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism, and has been shown to catabolize S-Nitrosoglutathione, as a means to degrade NO in an NADPH dependent manner. Enzymes belonging to this class and catalyzing the above shown conversion have been described to occur in many organisms and have extensively been described in the literature.

In a preferred embodiment the carbonyl reductase employed in a method according to the invention is derived from a mammal, preferably from a rodent, even more preferably from a rodent of the genus Rattus and most preferably from Rattus norvegicus. An example for such an enzyme is the carbonyl reductase from Rattus norvegicus (Uniprot B2GV72; Okamoto et al., IUBMB Life 48 (1999), 543-547). Amino acid and nucleotide sequences for carbonyl reductases are available. SEQ ID NO:18 is the amino acid sequence of a carbonyl reductase derived from Rattus norvegicus (Uniprot B2GV72).

Alternatively, in another aspect, the 3-buten-2-one reductase catalyzing the enzymatic conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol, may be a short chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase. These enzymes, i.e., the short-chain dehydrogenases\/fatty acyl-CoA reductase, in particular fatty acyl-CoA reductases derived from marine bacteria, have already been described above and the same as has been set forth above also applies here, in particular as regards the preferred embodiments. In the Examples it is shown that short-chain dehydrogenases\/fatty acyl-CoA reductases can be employed for converting 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol. In preferred embodiments of the method according to the invention an enzyme originating from a bacterium is employed, preferably from a marine bacterium, preferably from the genus Marinobacter or Hahella, most preferably from the species Hahella chejuensis. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the enzyme employed is the one showing the amino acid sequence as reflected in Uniprot Q2SCEO. The 3-buten-2-ol produced by a method as described herein-above may be further converted into 1,3-butadiene, in particular via an enzymatic conversion, i.e. by making use of an alkenol dehydratase. Thus, the present invention also relates to a method for the production of 1,3-butadiene comprising: (a) producing 3-buten-2-ol according to a method of the invention as described herein-above, and (b) the step of enzymatically converting the thus produced 3-buten-2-ol into 1,3-butadiene. An enzyme which is capable of converting 3-buten-2-ol into 1,3-butadiene is referred to in this context as an alkenol dehydratase. An example of an alkenol dehydratase to be employed in a method according to the present invention is the enzyme which has been designated \u201clinalool dehydratase-isomerase\u201d and which has been identified in Castellaniella defragrans (formerly Alcaligenes defragrans) strain 65Phen (Brodkorb et al., J. Biol. Chem. 285 (2010), 30436-30442). Linalool dehydratase-isomerase is a bifunctional enzyme which is involved in the anaerobic degradation of monoterpenes. The native enzyme has been found to have a molecular mass of 160 kDa and is assumed to be a homotetramer of 40 kDa subunits. The enzyme catalyzes in vitro two reactions in both directions depending on the thermodynamic driving forces. On the one hand, the enzyme catalyzes the isomerisation of the primary allyl alcohol geraniol into its stereoisomer linalool which bears a tertiary allyl alcohol motif. On the other hand, the enzyme catalyzes the water secession (dehydration) from the tertiary alcohol linalool to the corresponding acyclic monoterpene beta-myrcene, a molecule bearing a conjugated diene motif. In Castellaniella defragrans the protein is expressed as a precursor protein with a signal peptide for a periplasmatic location which is cleaved after transport through the membrane. The enzyme is classified as EC 4.2.1.127. A linalool dehydratase-isomerase has the capacity to catalyze the following reaction under anaerobic conditions: Linalool<=>myrcene+H2O This activity can, e.g., be measured with an assay as described in Brodkorb et al. (loc. cit.). In such an assay, vials are prewarmed at 35\u00b0 C., anoxic protein solution is transferred into the vials and DTT is added to 2 mM. The reaction mixtures are sealed with a butyl septum and the headspace is flushed with CO2\/N2 (10\/90 (v\/v)). The reaction is started by adding a distinct concentration of linalool and incubated at 35\u00b0 C. The conversion of linalool into myrcene is assessed by investigating the production of myrcene, e.g. by gas chromatography. In a preferred embodiment, a linalool dehydratase-isomerase also has the capacity to catalyze the isomerisation of geraniol into linalool under anaerobic conditions: Geraniol<=>linalool This activity can, e.g., be measured with an assay as described in Brodkorb et al. (loc. cit.). In such an assay, vials are prewarmed at 35\u00b0 C., anoxic protein solution is transferred into the vials and DTT is added to 2 mM. The reaction mixtures are sealed with a butyl septum and the headspace is flushed with CO2\/N2 (10\/90 (v\/v)). The reaction is started by adding a distinct concentration of geraniol and incubated at 35\u00b0 C. The conversion of geraniol into linalool is assessed by investigating the production of myrcene, i.e. the product of the second reaction catalyzed by the enzyme, e.g. by gas chromatography. Geraniol, linalool and myrcene are acyclic C10-terpenoids produced by plants, belonging to the class of allyl alcohols and hydrocarbons, respectively. L\u00fcddecke and Harder (Z. Naturforsch. 66c (2011), 409-412) reported on a high substrate specificity of linalool dehydratase-isomerase. It has been shown that linalool dehydratase-isomerase can act on but-3-en-2-ol and convert it into butadiene. An example of a sequence of an alkenol dehydratase which can be employed in the method according to the present invention is given in SEQ ID NO: 19. A sequence for an alkenol dehydratase is also accessible in the UniProtKB\/TrEMBL database under accession number E1XUJ2. These sequences represent an alkenol dehydratase which is classified as a linalool dehydratase-isomerase. In a preferred embodiment the method according to the present invention makes use of an alkenol dehydratase comprising the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 19 or a sequence which is at least x % identical to SEQ ID NO: 19 and which is able to catalyze the conversion of 3-buten-2-ol into 1,3-butadiene, with x being an integer between 30 and 100, preferably 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99. The term \u201can alkenol dehydratase\u201d as used in the present invention therefore in particular refers to an enzyme which shows the above indicated degree of sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 19 and which can catalyze the conversion of 3-buten-2-ol into 1,3-butadiene. By using the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 19 or corresponding encoding nucleotide sequences, it is possible for the skilled person to identify further alkenol dehydratases which can catalyze the above indicated conversion. Finally, the present invention also relates to a method for the production of 3-buten-2-ol comprising the enzymatic conversion of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone into 3-buten-2-one by making use of an enzyme catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration and the enzymatic conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol by making use of a 3-buten-2-one reductase. The enzyme catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration is not particularly limited to a specific enzyme as described herein above but can be any possible enzyme which can catalyze this conversion. In a preferred embodiment, the enzyme catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration is an enzyme as described above. Moreover, the enzyme converting 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol by making use of a 3-buten-2-one reductase is not particularly limited to a specific enzyme but may, in a preferred embodiment, be an enzyme as described above in the context of the fourth aspect of the present invention. When referring to \u201chomology\u201d in connection with amino acid or nucleotide sequences, reference is preferably made to sequence identity. The degree of sequence identity can be determined according to methods well known in the art using preferably suitable computer algorithms such as CLUSTAL. When using the Clustal analysis method to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, at least 60% identical to a reference sequence default settings may be used or the settings are preferably as follows: Matrix: blosum 30; Open gap penalty: 10.0; Extend gap penalty: 0.05; Delay divergent: 40; Gap separation distance: 8 for comparisons of amino acid sequences. For nucleotide sequence comparisons, the Extend gap penalty is preferably set to 5.0. In a preferred embodiment ClustalW2 is used for the comparison of amino acid sequences. In the case of pairwise comparisons\/alignments, the following settings are preferably chosen: Protein weight matrix: BLOSUM 62; gap open: 10; gap extension: 0.1. In the case of multiple comparisons\/alignments, the following settings are preferably chosen: Protein weight matrix: BLOSUM 62; gap open: 10; gap extension: 0.2; gap distance: 5; no end gap. Preferably, the degree of identity is calculated over the complete length of the sequence. When the sequences which are compared do not have the same length, the degree of identity either refers to the percentage of residues in the shorter sequence which are identical to residues in the longer sequence or to the percentage of residues in the longer sequence which are identical to residues in the shorter sequence. Preferably, it refers to the percentage of residues in the shorter sequence which are identical to residues in the longer sequence The methods according to the present invention may be carried out in vitro or in vivo. An in vitro reaction is understood to be a reaction in which no cells are employed, i.e. an acellular reaction. Thus, in vitro preferably means in a cell-free system. The term \u201cin vitro\u201d in one embodiment means in the presence of isolated enzymes (or enzyme systems optionally comprising possibly required cofactors). In one embodiment, the enzymes employed in the method are used in purified form. For carrying out the method in vitro the substrates for the reaction and the enzymes are incubated under conditions (buffer, temperature, cosubstrates, cofactors etc.) allowing the enzymes to be active and the enzymatic conversion to occur. The reaction is allowed to proceed for a time sufficient to produce the respective product. The production of the respective products can be measured by methods known in the art, such as gas chromatography possibly linked to mass spectrometry detection. The enzymes may be in any suitable form allowing the enzymatic reaction to take place. They may be purified or partially purified or in the form of crude cellular extracts or partially purified extracts. It is also possible that the enzymes are immobilized on a suitable carrier. In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the enzymes employed in such an in vitro reaction according to the present invention is a non-naturally occurring enzyme, e.g., a variant of an enzyme which does not as such occur in nature. Such variants include, for example, mutants, in particular prepared by molecular biological methods, which show improved properties, such as a higher enzyme activity, higher substrate specificity, higher temperature resistance and the like. In one embodiment of the method according to the invention the substrate which is used in such an in vitro method is 4-hydroxy-2-butanone which is converted by the use of the above-mentioned enzymes to 3-buten-2-one. In another embodiment, the substrate used in such an in vitro method is acetoacetyl-CoA which is first converted into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone as described above which is then in turn converted into 3-buten-2-one as described above. In another embodiment, the substrate used in such an in vitro method is acetyl-CoA which is first converted into acetoacetyl-CoA as described above which is then converted into 4-hydroxy-2-butanone as described above which is then in turn converted into 3-buten-2-one as described above. The in vitro method according to the invention may be carried out in a one-pot-reaction, i.e. the substrate is combined in one reaction mixture with the above described enzymes necessary for the conversion into 3-buten-2-one, 3-buten-2-ol or 1,3-butadiene, respectively, and the reaction is allowed to proceed for a time sufficient to produce the respective product. Alternatively, the method may also be carried out by effecting one or more enzymatic steps in a consecutive manner, i.e. by first mixing the substrate with one or more enzymes and allowing the reaction to proceed to an intermediate and then adding one or more further enzymes to convert the intermediate further either into an intermediate or into butadiene. The in vitro method according to the invention furthermore may comprise the step of collecting the product(s), preferably the gaseous products, in particular 1,3-butadiene, degassing out of the reaction, i.e. recovering the products from the culture or, in the case of gaseous products the products which degas, e.g., out of the culture. Thus, in one embodiment, the method is carried out in the presence of a system for collecting a gaseous product, such as butadiene, under gaseous form during the reaction. As a matter of fact, 1,3-butadiene, adopts the gaseous state at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The method according to the invention therefore does not necessarily require extraction of the product from the reaction mixture, a step which is always very costly when performed at industrial scale. The evacuation and storage of butadiene and its possible subsequent physical separation from other gaseous substances as well as its chemical conversion can be performed according to any method known to one of skill in the art. For example, butadiene can be separated from CO2 by the condensation of CO2 at low temperatures. CO2 can also be removed by polar solvents, e.g. ethanolamine. Moreover, it can be isolated by adsorption on a hydrophobic membrane. In another embodiment the method according to the invention is carried out in culture, in the presence of an organism, preferably a microorganism, producing at least one of the enzymes described above which are necessary to produce 3-buten-2-one according to one of the methods of the invention. Moreover, in another embodiment the method according to the invention is carried out in culture, in the presence of an organism, preferably a microorganism, producing at least one of the enzymes described above which are necessary to produce 3-buten-2-ol according to one of the methods of the invention. Moreover, in another embodiment the method according to the invention is carried out in culture, in the presence of an organism, preferably a microorganism, producing at least one of the enzymes described above which are necessary to produce 1,3-butadiene according to one of the method of the invention. Thus, in such embodiments of the invention, an organism, preferably a microorganism, that produces at least one of the enzymes specified in the description, above, is used. It is possible to use a (micro)organism which naturally produces one or more of the required enzymes and to genetically modify such a (micro)organism so that it expresses also those enzymes which it does not naturally express. If a (micro)organism is used which naturally expresses one of the required enzyme activities, it is possible to modify such a (micro)organism so that this activity is overexpressed in the (mircro)organism. This can, e.g., be achieved by effecting mutations in the promoter region of the corresponding gene so as to lead to a promoter which ensures a higher expression of the gene. Alternatively, it is also possible to mutate the gene as such so as to lead to an enzyme showing a higher activity. By using (micro)organisms which express the enzymes which are necessary for achieving the enzymatic conversions as described above, it is possible to carry out the method according to the invention directly in the culture medium, without the need to separate or purify the enzymes. In one embodiment the organism employed in the method according to the invention is an organism, preferably a microorganism, which has been genetically modified to contain one or more foreign nucleic acid molecules encoding one or more of the enzymes as described above. The term \u201cforeign\u201d in this context means that the nucleic acid molecule does not naturally occur in said organism\/microorganism. This means that it does not occur in the same structure or at the same location in the organism\/microorganism. In one preferred embodiment, the foreign nucleic acid molecule is a recombinant molecule comprising a promoter and a coding sequence encoding the respective enzyme in which the promoter driving expression of the coding sequence is heterologous with respect to the coding sequence. Heterologous in this context means that the promoter is not the promoter naturally driving the expression of said coding sequence but is a promoter naturally driving expression of a different coding sequence, i.e., it is derived from another gene, or is a synthetic promoter or a chimeric promoter. Preferably, the promoter is a promoter heterologous to the organism\/microorganism, i.e. a promoter which does naturally not occur in the respective organism\/microorganism. Even more preferably, the promoter is an inducible promoter. Promoters for driving expression in different types of organisms, in particular in microorganisms, are well known to the person skilled in the art. In a further embodiment the nucleic acid molecule is foreign to the organism\/microorganism in that the encoded enzyme is not endogenous to the organism\/microorganism, i.e. is naturally not expressed by the organism\/microorganism when it is not genetically modified. In other words, the encoded enzyme is heterologous with respect to the organism\/microorganism. The foreign nucleic acid molecule may be present in the organism\/microorganism in extrachromosomal form, e.g. as a plasmid, or stably integrated in the chromosome. A stable integration is preferred. Thus, the genetic modification can consist, e.g. in integrating the corresponding gene(s) encoding the enzyme(s) into the chromosome, or in expressing the enzyme(s) from a plasmid containing a promoter upstream of the enzyme-coding sequence, the promoter and coding sequence preferably originating from different organisms, or any other method known to one of skill in the art. Genetically modified organisms are organisms which do not naturally occur, i.e., which cannot be found in nature, and which differ substantially from naturally occurring organisms due to the introduction of a foreign nucleic acid molecule. Such non-naturally occurring organisms are preferably employed in a method according to the present invention carried out in vivo. The organisms used in the invention can be prokaryotes or eukaryotes, preferably, they are microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts, fungi or molds, or plant cells or animal cells. In a particular embodiment, the microorganisms are bacteria, preferably of the genus Escherichia or Bacillus and even more preferably of the species Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. It is also possible to employ an extremophilic bacterium such as Thermus thermophilus, or anaerobic bacteria from the family Clostridiae. In one embodiment the microorganism is a fungus, more preferably a fungus of the genus Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Pichia or Kluyveromyces and even more preferably of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma reesei, Pichia pastoris or of the species Kluyveromyces lactis. In another embodiment, the method according to the invention makes use of a photosynthetic microorganism expressing at least the enzymes which are necessary for achieving the enzymatic conversions as described above. Preferably, the microorganism is a photosynthetic bacterium, or a microalgae. In a further embodiment the microorganism is an algae, more preferably an algae belonging to the diatomeae. In another embodiment, it is possible to use a microorganism which belongs to the group of acetogenic bacteria which are capable of converting CO (or CO2+H2) to produce acetyl-CoA via the so-called Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (K\u00f6pke et al.; PNAS 10 (2010), 13087-13092). A fermentation process using such microorganisms is known as syngas fermentation. Strictly mesophilic anaerobes such as C. ljungdahlii, C. aceticum, Acetobacterium woodii, C. autoethanogenum, and C. carboxydeviron, are frequently being used in syngas fermentation (Munasingheet et al.; Bioresource Technology 101 (2010), 5013-5022). It is also conceivable to use in the method according to the invention a combination of (micro)organisms wherein different (micro)organisms express different enzymes as described above. In another embodiment the method according to the invention makes use of a multicellular organism expressing at least one of the enzymes which are necessary for achieving the enzymatic conversions as described above. Examples for such organisms are plants or animals. In a particular embodiment, the method according to the invention involves culturing microorganisms in standard culture conditions (30-37\u00b0 C. at 1 atm, in a fermenter allowing aerobic growth of the bacteria) or non-standard conditions (higher temperature to correspond to the culture conditions of thermophilic organisms, for example). In a further embodiment the method of the invention is carried out under microaerophilic conditions. This means that the quantity of injected air is limiting so as to minimize residual oxygen concentrations in the gaseous effluents containing butadiene. In another embodiment the method according to the invention furthermore comprises the step of collecting the product either from the culture or, in the case of a gaseous product, like, 1,3-butadiene degassing out of the reaction, from the culture off-gas. Thus in a preferred embodiment, the method is carried out in the presence of a system for collecting a product, for example, a gaseous product, such as 1,3-butadiene, under gaseous form during the reaction. As a matter of fact, 1,3-butadiene adopts the gaseous state at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The method according to the invention therefore does not necessarily require extraction of butadiene from the liquid culture medium, a step which is always very costly when performed at industrial scale. The evacuation and storage of butadiene and its possible subsequent physical separation and chemical conversion can be performed according to any method known to one of skill in the art and as described above. In a particular embodiment, the method also comprises detecting a gaseous product, such as butadiene, which is present in the gaseous phase. The presence of, e.g., butadiene in an environment of air or another gas, even in small amounts, can be detected by using various techniques and in particular by using gas chromatography systems with infrared or flame ionization detection, or by coupling with mass spectrometry. When the method according to the invention is carried out in vivo by using an organism\/microorganism providing the respective enzyme activities, the organism, preferably microorganism, is cultivated under suitable culture conditions allowing the occurrence of the enzymatic reaction. The specific culture conditions depend on the specific organism\/microorganism employed but are well known to the person skilled in the art. The culture conditions are generally chosen in such a manner that they allow the expression of the genes encoding the enzymes for the respective reactions. Various methods are known to the person skilled in the art in order to improve and fine-tune the expression of certain genes at certain stages of the culture such as induction of gene expression by chemical inducers or by a temperature shift. In another embodiment, the method of the invention comprises the step of providing the organism, preferably the microorganism carrying the respective enzyme activity or activities in the form of a (cell) culture, preferably in the form of a liquid cell culture, a subsequent step of cultivating the organism, preferably the microorganism in a fermenter (often also referred to a bioreactor) under suitable conditions allowing the expression of the respective enzyme and further comprising the step of effecting an enzymatic conversion of a method of the invention as described herein above. Suitable fermenter or bioreactor devices and fermentation conditions are known to the person skilled in the art. A bioreactor or a fermenter refers to any manufactured or engineered device or system known in the art that supports a biologically active environment. Thus, a bioreactor or a fermenter may be a vessel in which a chemical\/biochemical process like the method of the present invention is carried out which involves organisms, preferably microorganisms and\/or biochemically active substances, i.e., the enzyme(s) described above derived from such organisms or organisms harbouring the above described enzyme(s). In a bioreactor or a fermenter, this process can either be aerobic or anaerobic. These bioreactors are commonly cylindrical, and may range in size from litres to cubic metres, and are often made of stainless steel. In this respect, without being bound by theory, the fermenter or bioreactor may be designed in a way that it is suitable to cultivate the organisms, preferably microorganisms, in, e.g., a batch-culture, feed-batch-culture, perfusion culture or chemostate-culture, all of which are generally known in the art. The culture medium can be any culture medium suitable for cultivating the respective organism or microorganism. As described above, such a method according to the present invention may also comprise the step of recovering the produced product from the culture medium and\/or the fermentation off-gas. In another embodiment the organism employed in the method according to the invention is a plant. In principle any possible plant can be used, i.e. a monocotyledonous plant or a dicotyledonous plant. It is preferable to use a plant which can be cultivated on an agriculturally meaningful scale and which allows to produce large amounts of biomass. Examples are grasses like Lolium, cereals like rye, wheat, barley, oat, millet, maize, other starch storing plants like potato or sugar storing plants like sugar cane or sugar beet. Conceivable is also the use of tobacco or of vegetable plants such as tomato, pepper, cucumber, egg plant etc. Another possibility is the use of oil storing plants such as rape seed, olives etc. Also conceivable is the use of trees, in particular fast growing trees such as eucalyptus, poplar or rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). As described above, it is possible to use in the method according to the invention a (micro)organism which is genetically modified so as to contain a nucleic acid molecule encoding at least one of the which are necessary for achieving the enzymatic conversions as described above. Such a nucleic acid molecule encoding an enzyme as described above can be used alone or as part of a vector. The nucleic acid molecules can further comprise expression control sequences operably linked to the polynucleotide comprised in the nucleic acid molecule. The term \u201coperatively linked\u201d or \u201coperably linked\u201d, as used throughout the present description, refers to a linkage between one or more expression control sequences and the coding region in the polynucleotide to be expressed in such a way that expression is achieved under conditions compatible with the expression control sequence. Expression comprises transcription of the heterologous DNA sequence, preferably into a translatable mRNA. Regulatory elements ensuring expression in fungi as well as in bacteria, are well known to those skilled in the art. They encompass promoters, enhancers, termination signals, targeting signals and the like. Examples are given further below in connection with explanations concerning vectors. Promoters for use in connection with the nucleic acid molecule may be homologous or heterologous with regard to its origin and\/or with regard to the gene to be expressed. Suitable promoters are for instance promoters which lend themselves to constitutive expression. However, promoters which are only activated at a point in time determined by external influences can also be used. Artificial and\/or chemically inducible promoters may be used in this context. The vectors can further comprise expression control sequences operably linked to said polynucleotides contained in the vectors. These expression control sequences may be suited to ensure transcription and synthesis of a translatable RNA in bacteria or fungi. In addition, it is possible to insert different mutations into the polynucleotides by methods usual in molecular biology (see for instance Sambrook and Russell (2001), Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, CSH Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA), leading to the synthesis of polypeptides possibly having modified biological properties. The introduction of point mutations is conceivable at positions at which a modification of the amino acid sequence for instance influences the biological activity or the regulation of the polypeptide. Moreover, mutants possessing a modified substrate or product specificity can be prepared. Preferably, such mutants show an increased activity. Furthermore, the introduction of mutations into the polynucleotides encoding an enzyme as defined above allows the gene expression rate and\/or the activity of the enzymes encoded by said polynucleotides to be optimized. For genetically modifying bacteria or fungi, the polynucleotides encoding an enzyme as defined above or parts of these molecules can be introduced into plasmids which permit mutagenesis or sequence modification by recombination of DNA sequences. Standard methods (see Sambrook and Russell (2001), Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, CSH Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA) allow base exchanges to be performed or natural or synthetic sequences to be added. DNA fragments can be connected to each other by applying adapters and linkers to the fragments. Moreover, engineering measures which provide suitable restriction sites or remove surplus DNA or restriction sites can be used. In those cases, in which insertions, deletions or substitutions are possible, in vitro mutagenesis, \u201cprimer repair\u201d, restriction or ligation can be used. In general, a sequence analysis, restriction analysis and other methods of biochemistry and molecular biology are carried out as analysis methods. The polynucleotide introduced into a (micro)organism is expressed so as to lead to the production of a polypeptide having any of the activities described above. An overview of different expression systems is for instance contained in Methods in Enzymology 153 (1987), 385-516, in Bitter et al. (Methods in Enzymology 153 (1987), 516-544) and in Sawers et al. (Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 46 (1996), 1-9), Billman-Jacobe (Current Opinion in Biotechnology 7 (1996), 500-4), Hockney (Trends in Biotechnology 12 (1994), 456-463), Griffiths et al., (Methods in Molecular Biology 75 (1997), 427-440). An overview of yeast expression systems is for instance given by Hensing et al. (Antonie van Leuwenhoek 67 (1995), 261-279), Bussineau et al. (Developments in Biological Standardization 83 (1994), 13-19), Gellissen et al. (Antonie van Leuwenhoek 62 (1992), 79-93, Fleer (Current Opinion in Biotechnology 3 (1992), 486-496), Vedvick (Current Opinion in Biotechnology 2 (1991), 742-745) and Buckholz (Bio\/Technology 9 (1991), 1067-1072). Expression vectors have been widely described in the literature. As a rule, they contain not only a selection marker gene and a replication-origin ensuring replication in the host selected, but also a bacterial or viral promoter, and in most cases a termination signal for transcription. Between the promoter and the termination signal there is in general at least one restriction site or a polylinker which enables the insertion of a coding DNA sequence. The DNA sequence naturally controlling the transcription of the corresponding gene can be used as the promoter sequence, if it is active in the selected host organism. However, this sequence can also be exchanged for other promoter sequences. It is possible to use promoters ensuring constitutive expression of the gene and inducible promoters which permit a deliberate control of the expression of the gene. Bacterial and viral promoter sequences possessing these properties are described in detail in the literature. Regulatory sequences for the expression in microorganisms (for instance E. coli, S. cerevisiae) are sufficiently described in the literature. Promoters permitting a particularly high expression of a downstream sequence are for instance the T7 promoter (Studier et al., Methods in Enzymology 185 (1990), 60-89), lacUV5, trp, trp-lacUV5 (DeBoer et al., in Rodriguez and Chamberlin (Eds), Promoters, Structure and Function; Praeger, New York, (1982), 462-481; DeBoer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1983), 21-25), lp1 rac (Boros et al., Gene 42 (1986), 97-100). Inducible promoters are preferably used for the synthesis of polypeptides. These promoters often lead to higher polypeptide yields than do constitutive promoters. In order to obtain an optimum amount of polypeptide, a two-stage process is often used. First, the host cells are cultured under optimum conditions up to a relatively high cell density. In the second step, transcription is induced depending on the type of promoter used. In this regard, a tac promoter is particularly suitable which can be induced by lactose or IPTG (=isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside) (deBoer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 (1983), 21-25). Termination signals for transcription are also described in the literature. The transformation of the host cell with a polynucleotide or vector according to the invention can be carried out by standard methods, as for instance described in Sambrook and Russell (2001), Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, CSH Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA; Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Laboratory Course Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1990. The host cell is cultured in nutrient media meeting the requirements of the particular host cell used, in particular in respect of the pH value, temperature, salt concentration, aeration, antibiotics, vitamins, trace elements etc. The present invention also relates to an organism, preferably a microorganism, which is able to express the above described enzymes required for the conversion of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone into 3-buten-2-one and for the conversion of 3-buten-2-one into 3-buten-2-ol. Thus, the present invention relates to an organism or microorganism which expresses (i) an enzyme catalyzing 4-hydroxy-2-butanone dehydration as defined above, and (ii) a 3-buten-2-one reductase as defined above.

In one embodiment an organism according to the present invention is a recombinant organism in the sense that it is genetically modified due to the introduction of at least one nucleic acid molecule encoding at least one of the above mentioned enzymes.

Accordingly, the organism according to the present invention is preferably a non-naturally occurring organism which differs from a naturally occurring organism due to the introduction of a foreign nucleic acid molecule. The microorganism is preferably a bacterium, a yeast or a fungus. In another preferred embodiment the organism is a plant or non-human animal.

EXAMPLES Example 1 Cloning, Expression and Purification of Enzymes Gene Synthesis, Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Proteins The sequences of studied enzymes inferred from the genomes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms were generated by oligonucleotide concatenation to fit the codon usage of E. coli (genes were commercially synthesized by GeneArt AG). A stretch of 6 histidine codons was inserted after the methionine initiation codon to provide an affinity tag for purification. The genes thus synthesized were cloned in a pET-25b(+) expression vector (vectors were constructed by GeneArt AG). Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were transformed with these vectors according to standard heat shock procedure. The transformed cells were grown with shaking (160 rpm) using ZYM-5052 auto-induction medium (Studier F W, Prot. Exp. Pur. 41, (2005), 207-234) for 6 h at 37\u00b0 C. and protein expression was continued at 28\u00b0 C. or 20\u00b0 C. overnight (approximately 16 h). The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4\u00b0 C., 10.000 rpm for 20 min and the pellets were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. Protein Purification and Concentration The pellets from 200 ml of culture cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in 5 ml of Na2HPO4 pH 8 containing 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT. Twenty microliters of lysonase (Novagen) were added. Cells were incubated 10 minutes at room temperature and then returned to ice for 20 minutes. Cell lysis was completed by sonication for 3\u00d715 seconds. The bacterial extracts were then clarified by centrifugation at 4\u00b0 C., 10.000 rpm for 20 min. The clarified bacterial lysates were loaded on PROTINO-1000 Ni-TED column (Macherey-Nagel) allowing adsorption of 6-His tagged proteins. Columns were washed and the enzymes of interest were eluted with 4 ml of 50 mM Na2HPO4 pH 8 containing 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 250 mM imidazole. Eluates were then concentrated, desalted on Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa filter unit (Millipore) and enzymes were resuspended in buffers compatible with downstream enzyme activity assay. Protein concentrations were quantified by direct UV 280 nm measurement on the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The purity of proteins thus purified varied from 60% to 90%. Example 2 Continuous Spectrophotometric Assay of Acetoacetyl-CoA Reductase Activity The genes of short-chain dehydrogenase\/fatty acyl-CoA reductases were synthesized and corresponding enzymes were further produced according to the procedure described in Example 1. Purified enzymes were resuspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5. Standard reaction mixture for assays of acetoacetyl-CoA reductase activity contained 5 mM acetoacetyl-CoA, 100 mM NaCl and 0.1-0.4 mM NADPH in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5. Each assay was started by adding 1 mg\/ml of enzyme. Control assays were performed in which either no enzyme was added, or no substrate was added. Reactions were conducted at 37\u00b0 C. Each sample was continuously monitored for the decrease of NADPH at 340 nm on a SpectraMax Plus384 UV\/Vis Microplate Reader (Molecular Device).

Among the technologies, since a role of an RNA interference (hereinafter, referred to as \u2018RNAi\u2019) had been found, it was found that the RNA interference acts on a sequence-specific mRNA in various kinds of mammalian cells (Silence of the transcripts: RNA interference in medicine. J. Mol. Med. (2005) 83: 764-773). When a long-chain double-stranded RNA is delivered into a cell, the delivered double-stranded RNA is converted into a small interfering RNA (hereinafter, referred to as \u2018siRNA\u2019) which is processed to 21 to 23 base pairs (bp) by Dicer endonuclease. siRNA is bonded to an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whereby a guide (antisense) strand recognizes and decomposes a target mRNA to sequence-specifically inhibit expression of a target gene (NUCLEIC-ACID THERAPEUTICS: BASIC PRINCIPLES AND RECENT APPLICATIONS. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. 2002. 1, 503-514). Bertrand et al., found that as compared to an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) on the same target gene, siRNA has an effect of significantly inhibiting mRNA expression in vitro and in vivo, and the corresponding effect is maintained for a long time (Comparison of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs in cell culture and in vivo. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002. 296: 1000-1004). In addition, since siRNA is complementarily coupled to a target mRNA to sequence-specifically regulate an expression of the target gene, a mechanism of the siRNA has an advantage in that a target to be applicable may be remarkably increased as compared to the existing antibody-based medical product or chemical pharmaceuticals (small molecular drug) (Progress Towards in Vivo Use of siRNAs. MOLECULAR THERAPY. 2006 13(4):664-670). In order to develop the siRNA as a therapeutic agent even with excellent effect and variously usable range of the siRNA, the siRNA needs to be effectively delivered to a target cell with improved stability and a more efficient cell delivery of the siRNA (Harnessing In Vivo siRNA Delivery for Drug Discovery and Therapeutic Development. Drug Discov. Today. 2006 January; 11(1-2):67-73. In order to solve the problems, research into modification of some nucleotides or backbone of siRNA to have a nucleic acid lyase resistance, or use of carriers such as viral vectors, liposomes or nanoparticles, etc. for improving stability in vivo, has been actively attempted. Delivery systems using viral vectors such as adenovirus, retrovirus, etc, have high transfection efficacy, and also have high immunogenicity and oncogenicity. Meanwhile, a non-viral delivery system including nanoparticles has a low cell delivery efficiency as compared to the viral delivery system, but has high stability in vivo and is possible to be target-specifically delivered, has highly improved delivery effects such as uptake, internalization, etc., of RNAi oligonucleotide into cells or tissues, and rarely has cytotoxicity and immune stimulation, such that the non-viral delivery system is currently evaluated as a viable delivery method as compared to the viral delivery systems (Nonviral delivery of synthetic siRNA s in vivo. J Clin Invest. 2007 Dec. 3; 117(12): 3623-3632). In a method using a nanocarrier in the non-viral delivery systems, various polymers such as liposomes, cationic polymer composites, etc., are used to form nanoparticles, and a siRNA is supported on the nanoparticles, that is, nanocarrier, to be delivered into the cells. Among the methods using nanocarriers, a method using polymeric nanoparticle, polymer micelle, lipoplex, or the like, is mainly used, wherein the lipoplex consists of cationic lipid to interact with anionic lipid of endosome of a cell, thereby eliciting a destabilization effect of the endosome to deliver the siRNA into a cell (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 15; 93(21):11493-8, 1996). In addition, it is known that chemical materials, etc., are connected to end portions of a siRNA passenger (sense) strand to provide promoted pharmacokinetics characteristics, such that high efficacy may be induced in vivo (Nature 11; 432(7014):173-8, 2004). Here, stability of the siRNA may vary depending on properties of the chemical materials bonded to ends of the siRNA sense (passenger) or antisense (guide) strand. For example, a siRNA to which a polymer compound such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) is conjugated, interacts with an anionic phosphate group of siRNA in the presence of cationic materials to form a complex, thereby being a carrier having an improved siRNA stability (J. Control Release 129(2):107-16, 2008). In particular, micelle consisting of polymer complexes has an extremely small size, significantly uniform distribution, and is spontaneously form, thereby being easy to manage quality of formulation and secure reproducibility, as compared to other systems used as a drug delivery vehicle, such as microsphere, nanoparticle, etc. Further, in order to improve an intracellular delivery efficiency of siRNA, technology of using a siRNA conjugate in which hydrophilic material which is a biocompatible polymer (for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG)) is conjugated to the siRNA by a simple covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond, to thereby secure stability of siRNA and have effective cell membrane permeability was developed (see Korean Patent Publication No. 883471). However, the chemical modification of the siRNA and the conjugation with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PEGylation) still have disadvantages that stability in vivo is low and delivery into a target organ is not smooth. In order to solve the disadvantages, a double-helical oligo RNA structure in which a hydrophilic material and a hydrophobic material are bonded to oligonucleotides, in particular, double helical RNA such as siRNA, was developed, wherein the double-helical oligo RNA structure forms a self assembled nanoparticle named a self assembled micelle inhibitory RNA (SAMiRNA\u2122) by a hydrophobic interaction of a hydrophobic material (see Korean Patent Publication No. 1224828), the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology has an advantage in that homogenous nanoparticles having a significantly small size are capable of being obtained as compared to the existing delivery technologies. As a specific example of the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology, PEG (polyethylene glycol) is used as a hydrophilic material, wherein PEG is synthetic polymer, which is used for increasing solubility of pharmaceuticals, particularly, protein, and for controlling pharmacokinetics. PEG is a polydisperse material, a polymer in one batch consists of the sum of different number of monomers, a molecular weight is shown in the Gaussian curve, and polydispersity values (Mw\/Mn) express the homogeneity degree of a material. That is, when PEG has a low molecular weight (3 to 5 kDa), the polydisperse value is about 1.01, and when PEG has a high molecular weight (20 kDa), the polydisperse value is about 1.2, which is high, such that as the molecular weight is higher, the homogeneity of the material is relatively low (F. M. Veronese. Peptide and protein PEGylation: a review of problems and solutions. Biomaterials (2001) 22:405-417). Accordingly, when the PEG is combined to the pharmaceuticals, polydispersed characteristic of PEG is reflected on the conjugate, such that it is not easy to perform verification of single material, and accordingly, production of materials having a low polydisperse value through synthesis of PEG and improvement of purification processes is on a rising trend, but has still problems due to polydispersed characteristic of the material, particularly, when PEG is combined to a material having a small molecular weight, there is difficult in confirming whether or not the combination is easily performed, etc. (Francesco M. Veronese and Gianfranco Pasut. PEGylation, successful approach to drug delivery. DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY (2005) 10(21):1451-1458). Accordingly, recently, as an improved technology of SAMiRNA\u2122 which is the existing self-assembled nanoparticles, a technology of a new form of carrier having a significantly small size as compared to the existing SAMiRNA\u2122 and remarkably improved polydispersity has been developed by blocking the hydrophilic material of the double helical RNA structure configuring SAMiRNA\u2122 as a base unit including 1 to 15 uniform monomers having a predetermined molecular weight and a linker as needed, and using the appropriate number of blocked hydrophilic materials as needed. Meanwhile, since biopharmaceuticals specifically act to a target gene sequence or a protein structure, in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety in a non-clinical surrogate model, a material acting with the same mechanism as the corresponding biopharmaceuticals in human is additionally required even in species of the surrogate model. Therefore, in order to avoid difficulty in additionally finding the material including the same mechanism as human, a material acting with the same mechanism both in human (treatment target) in the mouse (the non-clinical surrogate model), is required to be developed. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (hereinafter, abbreviated as \u2018IPF\u2019) is a disease in which chronic inflammatory cells penetrate into a wall of an alveolar wall (lung alveolus) to make the lung become hard, causing severe structural change in lung tissue, such that lung function is gradually reduced to induce death. However, an effective treatment thereof does not exist yet, and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is generally diagnosed when symptoms appear at last, and has extremely bad prognosis since a median survival time is only about three to five years. It is reported that the incidence frequency of the foreign countries is about 3-5 people per 100,000, and it is known that the incidence is generally high after the age of 50, and men have a two-times higher incidence than women. The cause of IPF has not been clearly identified yet, and it is merely reported that high frequency is shown in smokers, antidepressants, chronic pulmonary inhalation due to gastroesophageal reflux, metal dust, wood dust, solvent inhalation, etc., are regarded as risk factors related with IPF occurrence. However, definitive causal factors cannot be found in the majority of patients. It is known that IPF is continuously worsen with no treatment, and about 50% of patients die within 3-5 years, and once a lung is completely hardened by fibrosis as the disease progresses, there is no improvement despite any treatment, and accordingly, it is predicted that an early treatment increases efficacy. As the currently used therapeutic agent, a combination therapy method using steroid and azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, has been known, but it is difficult to say that there are special effects, and attempts of several fibrosis inhibitors in animal experiments and small group of patients failed in proving clear effects. In particular, there is no other effective treatment in patients with end-stage IPF, in addition to lung transplantation. Therefore, development of more effective therapeutic agent against IPF is desperately required. Meanwhile, COPD, one of representative lung diseases together with asthma, is different from asthma in that it is accompanied by irreversible airway obstruction, and is a respiratory disease which is accompanied by abnormal inflammatory response of lung caused by repeated infection, harmful particles, gas inlet or smoking, and is not fully reversible, but shows increasingly progressed airflow limitation (Pauwels et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 163:1256-1276, 2001). COPD is a disease caused by pathological changes of bronchioles and lung parenchyma by airway and lung parenchyma inflammation, and is characterized by obstructive bronchiolitis and emphysema (destruction of lung parenchyma). Types of COPD include chronic obstructive bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and emphysema. In COPD, the number of neutrophils is increased, and secretion of cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and MIP-2 is increased. Further, airway inflammation, a thickened muscle wall, and bronchial closure due to increased mucus secretion are also shown. When bronchus is closed, alveoli are expanded and damaged, such that an exchange ability of oxygen and carbon dioxide is damaged to increase respiratory failure. The severity of COPD is emerging around the world since it is predicted that COPD ranked 6 th in 1990 among causes of death due to disease, but will rank in third place in 2020, and is the only disease of which the incidence is increased in 10 diseases. COPD has a high prevalence rate, causes a respiratory disorder, and requires a large amount of direct medical costs required for diagnosis and treatment of COPD, and a significant amount of indirect expenses such as losses due to dyspnea and leave of absence or loss due to premature death, which is a social and economic problem in the world (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment guidelines 2005. Chronic obstructive airway disease Clinical Research Center. p. 30-31). Existing therapeutic drugs have not been confirmed as relieving reduction in long time lung function which is a characteristic of COPD. Accordingly, drug treatment in COPD has a main purpose of reducing symptoms or complications. Among the therapeutic drugs, a bronchodilator is a typical COPD allopathic drug, and an anti-inflammatory drug or corticosteroid is usually prescribed, but the effect is not significant, the application range is narrow, and there is great concern for side effects. As other drugs, it is known that only the influenza vaccine reduces serious symptoms and death by about 50% in patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment guidelines 2005. Chronic obstructive airway disease Clinical Research Center. p. 52-58). Meanwhile, many genetic factors are estimated as increasing (or decreasing) the risk of individual COPD. A genetic risk factor which has been demonstrated so far is genetic deficiency of \u03b11-antitrypsin. Smoking significantly increases the risk of COPD, but occurrence of panlobular emphysema and reduction in lung function that rapidly progress at a young age are shown by both of smokers and non-smokers having significant genetic deficiency. Although other genes confirmed to be related with the COPD pathogenesis do not exist yet in addition to al-antitrypsin, attempt for identifying biomarkers of the disease to be utilized for diagnosis through research into cellular, molecular, and genetic abnormal states that are basically shown in patients with COPD or attempt for finding a new treatment method is being progressed (P. J. Barnes and R. A. Stockely. COPD: current therapeutic interventions and future approaches. Eur Respir J. (2005) 25:1084-1106). In particular, research into diagnosis of COPD and selection of target for treatment through methods such as gene microarray, proteomics, etc., has been actively conducted, and analyses of genetic factors for obtaining COPD sensitivity (susceptibility) and causes of the worsen COPD symptoms induced by smoking have been mainly conducted (Peter J. Castaldi et al. The COPD genetic association compendium. Human Molecular Genetics, 2010, Vol. 19, No. 3 526-534). CTGF (connective tissue growth factor; CCN2), which is one of matricellular proteins included in CCN family, is known to be a secretion cytokine involved in various biological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, wound repair, etc. Over-expression of CTGF is regarded as being main cause of symptoms such as scleroderma, fibrotic disease, and scar formation (Brigstock DR. Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2, CTGF) and organ fibrosis: lessons from transgenic animals. J Cell Commun Signal (2010) 4 (1): 1-4). In particular, regarding fibrosis, CTGF is known to cause sustained fibrosis together with TGF-\u03b2 (Transforming growth factor-\u03b2) or to promote production of ECM (extracelluar matrix) under a condition in which fiber formation is caused, and recently, it is known to be capable of treating ocular disorders or muscular dystrophy caused by abnormal expression of CTGF by treating samples or materials that hinder expression of CTGF or inhibiting action thereof, but relevancy with a respiratory disease has not been suggested (U.S. Pat. No. 7,622,454, and U.S Patent Application Publication No. 20120164151). CYR61 (Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61) is an extracelluar matrix (ECM)-related signaling protein included in CCN family, which is known to control various cellular activities such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, etc. The purified CYR61 promotes attachment and spreading of endothelial cells in a similar manner to fibronectin, and does not have mitogenic activity, but acts to reinforce a mitogen effect of a fibroblast growth factor (MARIA L. KIREEVA et al. Cyr61, a Product of a Growth Factor-Inducible Immediate-Early Gene, Promotes Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Adhesion. MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY, April 1996, p. 1326-1334). It is reported that Plekho1 (Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family O member 1) is present in a plasma membrane or nucleus, acts as a non-enzymatic regulator of protein kinase CK2\u03b11 (Casein kinase 2, alpha 1), and is involved in apoptosis by inhibition of AP-1 action through C-terminal piece produced when being decomposed by Caspase 3 (Denis G Bosc et al. Identification and Characterization of CKIP-1, a Novel Pleckstrin Homology Domain-containing Protein That Interacts with Protein Kinase CK2. The Journal of Biological Chemistry (2000) 275, 14295-14306; Lingqiang Zhang et al. Role for the pleckstrin homology domain containing protein CKIP-1 in AP-1 regulation and apoptosis. The EMBO Journal (2005) 24, 766-778). As described above, prevalence of the respiratory diseases, particularly, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD has increased, but therapeutic agents being capable of basically preventing and treating the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD do not exist yet. Therefore, the demand for the therapeutic agent for the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD showing high level of prevention and treatment effects without side effects is significantly largely present in the market.","summary":"<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <EOH>FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a nanoparticle formed of a double-helical oligo polymer structure according to the present invention.

The double helical-oligo RNA structure has a structure in which a hydrophilic material and a hydrophobic material are conjugated to both ends of double helical RNA (siRNA) by using a simple covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond so as to be effectively delivered into cells, wherein the structure may be converted into a nanoparticle form by hydrophobic interactions of the double helical-oligo RNA structures in an aqueous solution. The siRNA included in the double helical-oligo RNA structure is preferably a siRNA specific to CTGF, Cyr61, or Plekho1 (hereinafter, referred to as a CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA), which is a gene related with respiratory diseases, particularly, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Further, the present invention relates to a method for producing the double-helical oligo RNA structure and a pharmaceutical composition containing the double-helical oligo RNA structure for preventing or treating respiratory diseases, particularly, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD. BACKGROUND ART Technologies for inhibiting gene expression are important tools in the development of a therapeutic agent and target validation for treating diseases. Among the technologies, since a role of an RNA interference (hereinafter, referred to as \u2018RNAi\u2019) had been found, it was found that the RNA interference acts on a sequence-specific mRNA in various kinds of mammalian cells (Silence of the transcripts: RNA interference in medicine. J. Mol. Med. (2005) 83: 764-773). When a long-chain double-stranded RNA is delivered into a cell, the delivered double-stranded RNA is converted into a small interfering RNA (hereinafter, referred to as \u2018siRNA\u2019) which is processed to 21 to 23 base pairs (bp) by Dicer endonuclease. siRNA is bonded to an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whereby a guide (antisense) strand recognizes and decomposes a target mRNA to sequence-specifically inhibit expression of a target gene (NUCLEIC-ACID THERAPEUTICS: BASIC PRINCIPLES AND RECENT APPLICATIONS. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. 2002. 1, 503-514). Bertrand et al., found that as compared to an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) on the same target gene, siRNA has an effect of significantly inhibiting mRNA expression in vitro and in vivo, and the corresponding effect is maintained for a long time (Comparison of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs in cell culture and in vivo. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002. 296: 1000-1004). In addition, since siRNA is complementarily coupled to a target mRNA to sequence-specifically regulate an expression of the target gene, a mechanism of the siRNA has an advantage in that a target to be applicable may be remarkably increased as compared to the existing antibody-based medical product or chemical pharmaceuticals (small molecular drug) (Progress Towards in Vivo Use of siRNAs. MOLECULAR THERAPY. 2006 13(4):664-670). In order to develop the siRNA as a therapeutic agent even with excellent effect and variously usable range of the siRNA, the siRNA needs to be effectively delivered to a target cell with improved stability and a more efficient cell delivery of the siRNA (Harnessing In Vivo siRNA Delivery for Drug Discovery and Therapeutic Development. Drug Discov. Today. 2006 January; 11(1-2):67-73. In order to solve the problems, research into modification of some nucleotides or backbone of siRNA to have a nucleic acid lyase resistance, or use of carriers such as viral vectors, liposomes or nanoparticles, etc. for improving stability in vivo, has been actively attempted. Delivery systems using viral vectors such as adenovirus, retrovirus, etc, have high transfection efficacy, and also have high immunogenicity and oncogenicity. Meanwhile, a non-viral delivery system including nanoparticles has a low cell delivery efficiency as compared to the viral delivery system, but has high stability in vivo and is possible to be target-specifically delivered, has highly improved delivery effects such as uptake, internalization, etc., of RNAi oligonucleotide into cells or tissues, and rarely has cytotoxicity and immune stimulation, such that the non-viral delivery system is currently evaluated as a viable delivery method as compared to the viral delivery systems (Nonviral delivery of synthetic siRNA s in vivo. J Clin Invest. 2007 Dec. 3; 117(12): 3623-3632). In a method using a nanocarrier in the non-viral delivery systems, various polymers such as liposomes, cationic polymer composites, etc., are used to form nanoparticles, and a siRNA is supported on the nanoparticles, that is, nanocarrier, to be delivered into the cells. Among the methods using nanocarriers, a method using polymeric nanoparticle, polymer micelle, lipoplex, or the like, is mainly used, wherein the lipoplex consists of cationic lipid to interact with anionic lipid of endosome of a cell, thereby eliciting a destabilization effect of the endosome to deliver the siRNA into a cell (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 15; 93(21):11493-8, 1996). In addition, it is known that chemical materials, etc., are connected to end portions of a siRNA passenger (sense) strand to provide promoted pharmacokinetics characteristics, such that high efficacy may be induced in vivo (Nature 11; 432(7014):173-8, 2004). Here, stability of the siRNA may vary depending on properties of the chemical materials bonded to ends of the siRNA sense (passenger) or antisense (guide) strand. For example, a siRNA to which a polymer compound such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) is conjugated, interacts with an anionic phosphate group of siRNA in the presence of cationic materials to form a complex, thereby being a carrier having an improved siRNA stability (J. Control Release 129(2):107-16, 2008). In particular, micelle consisting of polymer complexes has an extremely small size, significantly uniform distribution, and is spontaneously form, thereby being easy to manage quality of formulation and secure reproducibility, as compared to other systems used as a drug delivery vehicle, such as microsphere, nanoparticle, etc. Further, in order to improve an intracellular delivery efficiency of siRNA, technology of using a siRNA conjugate in which hydrophilic material which is a biocompatible polymer (for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG)) is conjugated to the siRNA by a simple covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond, to thereby secure stability of siRNA and have effective cell membrane permeability was developed (see Korean Patent Publication No. 883471). However, the chemical modification of the siRNA and the conjugation with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PEGylation) still have disadvantages that stability in vivo is low and delivery into a target organ is not smooth. In order to solve the disadvantages, a double-helical oligo RNA structure in which a hydrophilic material and a hydrophobic material are bonded to oligonucleotides, in particular, double helical RNA such as siRNA, was developed, wherein the double-helical oligo RNA structure forms a self assembled nanoparticle named a self assembled micelle inhibitory RNA (SAMiRNA\u2122) by a hydrophobic interaction of a hydrophobic material (see Korean Patent Publication No. 1224828), the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology has an advantage in that homogenous nanoparticles having a significantly small size are capable of being obtained as compared to the existing delivery technologies. As a specific example of the SAMiRNA\u2122 technology, PEG (polyethylene glycol) is used as a hydrophilic material, wherein PEG is synthetic polymer, which is used for increasing solubility of pharmaceuticals, particularly, protein, and for controlling pharmacokinetics. PEG is a polydisperse material, a polymer in one batch consists of the sum of different number of monomers, a molecular weight is shown in the Gaussian curve, and polydispersity values (Mw\/Mn) express the homogeneity degree of a material. That is, when PEG has a low molecular weight (3 to 5 kDa), the polydisperse value is about 1.01, and when PEG has a high molecular weight (20 kDa), the polydisperse value is about 1.2, which is high, such that as the molecular weight is higher, the homogeneity of the material is relatively low (F. M. Veronese. Peptide and protein PEGylation: a review of problems and solutions. Biomaterials (2001) 22:405-417). Accordingly, when the PEG is combined to the pharmaceuticals, polydispersed characteristic of PEG is reflected on the conjugate, such that it is not easy to perform verification of single material, and accordingly, production of materials having a low polydisperse value through synthesis of PEG and improvement of purification processes is on a rising trend, but has still problems due to polydispersed characteristic of the material, particularly, when PEG is combined to a material having a small molecular weight, there is difficult in confirming whether or not the combination is easily performed, etc. (Francesco M. Veronese and Gianfranco Pasut. PEGylation, successful approach to drug delivery. DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY (2005) 10(21):1451-1458). Accordingly, recently, as an improved technology of SAMiRNA\u2122 which is the existing self-assembled nanoparticles, a technology of a new form of carrier having a significantly small size as compared to the existing SAMiRNA\u2122 and remarkably improved polydispersity has been developed by blocking the hydrophilic material of the double helical RNA structure configuring SAMiRNA\u2122 as a base unit including 1 to 15 uniform monomers having a predetermined molecular weight and a linker as needed, and using the appropriate number of blocked hydrophilic materials as needed. Meanwhile, since biopharmaceuticals specifically act to a target gene sequence or a protein structure, in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety in a non-clinical surrogate model, a material acting with the same mechanism as the corresponding biopharmaceuticals in human is additionally required even in species of the surrogate model. Therefore, in order to avoid difficulty in additionally finding the material including the same mechanism as human, a material acting with the same mechanism both in human (treatment target) in the mouse (the non-clinical surrogate model), is required to be developed. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (hereinafter, abbreviated as \u2018IPF\u2019) is a disease in which chronic inflammatory cells penetrate into a wall of an alveolar wall (lung alveolus) to make the lung become hard, causing severe structural change in lung tissue, such that lung function is gradually reduced to induce death. However, an effective treatment thereof does not exist yet, and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is generally diagnosed when symptoms appear at last, and has extremely bad prognosis since a median survival time is only about three to five years. It is reported that the incidence frequency of the foreign countries is about 3-5 people per 100,000, and it is known that the incidence is generally high after the age of 50, and men have a two-times higher incidence than women. The cause of IPF has not been clearly identified yet, and it is merely reported that high frequency is shown in smokers, antidepressants, chronic pulmonary inhalation due to gastroesophageal reflux, metal dust, wood dust, solvent inhalation, etc., are regarded as risk factors related with IPF occurrence. However, definitive causal factors cannot be found in the majority of patients. It is known that IPF is continuously worsen with no treatment, and about 50% of patients die within 3-5 years, and once a lung is completely hardened by fibrosis as the disease progresses, there is no improvement despite any treatment, and accordingly, it is predicted that an early treatment increases efficacy. As the currently used therapeutic agent, a combination therapy method using steroid and azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, has been known, but it is difficult to say that there are special effects, and attempts of several fibrosis inhibitors in animal experiments and small group of patients failed in proving clear effects. In particular, there is no other effective treatment in patients with end-stage IPF, in addition to lung transplantation. Therefore, development of more effective therapeutic agent against IPF is desperately required. Meanwhile, COPD, one of representative lung diseases together with asthma, is different from asthma in that it is accompanied by irreversible airway obstruction, and is a respiratory disease which is accompanied by abnormal inflammatory response of lung caused by repeated infection, harmful particles, gas inlet or smoking, and is not fully reversible, but shows increasingly progressed airflow limitation (Pauwels et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 163:1256-1276, 2001). COPD is a disease caused by pathological changes of bronchioles and lung parenchyma by airway and lung parenchyma inflammation, and is characterized by obstructive bronchiolitis and emphysema (destruction of lung parenchyma). Types of COPD include chronic obstructive bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and emphysema. In COPD, the number of neutrophils is increased, and secretion of cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and MIP-2 is increased. Further, airway inflammation, a thickened muscle wall, and bronchial closure due to increased mucus secretion are also shown. When bronchus is closed, alveoli are expanded and damaged, such that an exchange ability of oxygen and carbon dioxide is damaged to increase respiratory failure. The severity of COPD is emerging around the world since it is predicted that COPD ranked 6th in 1990 among causes of death due to disease, but will rank in third place in 2020, and is the only disease of which the incidence is increased in 10 diseases. COPD has a high prevalence rate, causes a respiratory disorder, and requires a large amount of direct medical costs required for diagnosis and treatment of COPD, and a significant amount of indirect expenses such as losses due to dyspnea and leave of absence or loss due to premature death, which is a social and economic problem in the world (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment guidelines 2005. Chronic obstructive airway disease Clinical Research Center. p. 30-31). Existing therapeutic drugs have not been confirmed as relieving reduction in long time lung function which is a characteristic of COPD. Accordingly, drug treatment in COPD has a main purpose of reducing symptoms or complications. Among the therapeutic drugs, a bronchodilator is a typical COPD allopathic drug, and an anti-inflammatory drug or corticosteroid is usually prescribed, but the effect is not significant, the application range is narrow, and there is great concern for side effects. As other drugs, it is known that only the influenza vaccine reduces serious symptoms and death by about 50% in patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment guidelines 2005. Chronic obstructive airway disease Clinical Research Center. p. 52-58). Meanwhile, many genetic factors are estimated as increasing (or decreasing) the risk of individual COPD. A genetic risk factor which has been demonstrated so far is genetic deficiency of \u03b11-antitrypsin. Smoking significantly increases the risk of COPD, but occurrence of panlobular emphysema and reduction in lung function that rapidly progress at a young age are shown by both of smokers and non-smokers having significant genetic deficiency. Although other genes confirmed to be related with the COPD pathogenesis do not exist yet in addition to al-antitrypsin, attempt for identifying biomarkers of the disease to be utilized for diagnosis through research into cellular, molecular, and genetic abnormal states that are basically shown in patients with COPD or attempt for finding a new treatment method is being progressed (P. J. Barnes and R. A. Stockely. COPD: current therapeutic interventions and future approaches. Eur Respir J. (2005) 25:1084-1106). In particular, research into diagnosis of COPD and selection of target for treatment through methods such as gene microarray, proteomics, etc., has been actively conducted, and analyses of genetic factors for obtaining COPD sensitivity (susceptibility) and causes of the worsen COPD symptoms induced by smoking have been mainly conducted (Peter J. Castaldi et al. The COPD genetic association compendium. Human Molecular Genetics, 2010, Vol. 19, No. 3 526-534). CTGF (connective tissue growth factor; CCN2), which is one of matricellular proteins included in CCN family, is known to be a secretion cytokine involved in various biological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, wound repair, etc. Over-expression of CTGF is regarded as being main cause of symptoms such as scleroderma, fibrotic disease, and scar formation (Brigstock DR. Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2, CTGF) and organ fibrosis: lessons from transgenic animals. J Cell Commun Signal (2010) 4 (1): 1-4). In particular, regarding fibrosis, CTGF is known to cause sustained fibrosis together with TGF-\u03b2 (Transforming growth factor-\u03b2) or to promote production of ECM (extracelluar matrix) under a condition in which fiber formation is caused, and recently, it is known to be capable of treating ocular disorders or muscular dystrophy caused by abnormal expression of CTGF by treating samples or materials that hinder expression of CTGF or inhibiting action thereof, but relevancy with a respiratory disease has not been suggested (U.S. Pat. No. 7,622,454, and U.S Patent Application Publication No. 20120164151). CYR61 (Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61) is an extracelluar matrix (ECM)-related signaling protein included in CCN family, which is known to control various cellular activities such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, etc. The purified CYR61 promotes attachment and spreading of endothelial cells in a similar manner to fibronectin, and does not have mitogenic activity, but acts to reinforce a mitogen effect of a fibroblast growth factor (MARIA L. KIREEVA et al. Cyr61, a Product of a Growth Factor-Inducible Immediate-Early Gene, Promotes Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Adhesion. MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY, April 1996, p. 1326-1334). It is reported that Plekho1 (Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family O member 1) is present in a plasma membrane or nucleus, acts as a non-enzymatic regulator of protein kinase CK2\u03b11 (Casein kinase 2, alpha 1), and is involved in apoptosis by inhibition of AP-1 action through C-terminal piece produced when being decomposed by Caspase 3 (Denis G Bosc et al. Identification and Characterization of CKIP-1, a Novel Pleckstrin Homology Domain-containing Protein That Interacts with Protein Kinase CK2. The Journal of Biological Chemistry (2000) 275, 14295-14306; Lingqiang Zhang et al. Role for the pleckstrin homology domain containing protein CKIP-1 in AP-1 regulation and apoptosis. The EMBO Journal (2005) 24, 766-778). As described above, prevalence of the respiratory diseases, particularly, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD has increased, but therapeutic agents being capable of basically preventing and treating the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD do not exist yet. Therefore, the demand for the therapeutic agent for the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD showing high level of prevention and treatment effects without side effects is significantly largely present in the market. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a novel siRNA specific to CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1 (hereinafter, referred to as a CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA), capable of inhibiting expression thereof at a significantly high efficiency, a double helical-oligo RNA structure containing the siRNA, and a method for producing the double-helical oligo RNA structure.

The present invention also provides a conjugate in which a hydrophilic material and a hydrophobic material are conjugated to both ends of siRNA, for effective in vivo delivery and for improving stability, of the respiratory diseases-related gene-specific siRNA, particularly, the CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA.

It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that in Structural Formulas (1) to (4), one to three phosphate group(s) may be bonded to 5\u2032 end of the antisense strand of the double-helical oligo RNA structure containing the CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA, and shRNA is capable of being used instead of using siRNA. The hydrophilic material in Structural Formulas (1) to (4) is preferably a cationic or non-ionic polymer material having a molecular weight of 200 to 10,000, more preferably, a non-ionic polymer material having a molecular weight of 1,000 to 2,000. For example, non-ionic hydrophilic polymer compounds such as polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyoxazoline, etc., are preferably used as the hydrophilic polymer material, but the present invention is not necessarily limited thereto. In particular, the hydrophilic material (A) in Structural Formulas (1) to (4) may be used in a hydrophilic material block form represented by the following Structural Formula (5) or (6), and by using an appropriate number (n in Structural Formula (5) or (6)) of hydrophilic material blocks as needed, problems caused by polydispersibility that may occur in a case of using a general synthetic polymer material, etc., may be largely improved. (A\u2032m-J)n Structural Formula 5 (J-A\u2032m)n Structural Formula 6 In Structural Formula (5), A\u2032 is a hydrophilic material monomer, J is a linker for connecting hydrophilic material monomers (the sum is m) therebetween or a linker for connecting hydrophilic material monomers (the sum is m) to siRNA, m is an integer of 1 to 15, n is an integer of 1 to 10, and the repeating unit represented by (A\u2032m-J) or (J-A\u2032m) corresponds to a base unit of the hydrophilic material block. When the hydrophilic material block is represented by Structural Formula (5) or (6), the double-helical oligo RNA structure containing the CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA according to the present invention may have a structure represented by the following Structural Formula (7) or (8): (A\u2032m-J)n-X-R-Y-B Structural Formula 7 (J-A\u2032m)n-X-R-Y-B Structural Formula 8 In Structural Formulas (7) and (8), X, R, Y and B are the same as being defined in Structural Formula (1), and A\u2032, J, m and n are the same as being defined in Structural Formulas (5) and (6). In Structural Formulas (5) and (6), the hydrophilic material monomer A\u2032 is usable without limitation as long as it meets the objects of the present invention among the monomers of the non-ionic hydrophilic polymer. The hydrophilic material monomer A\u2032 is preferably a monomer selected from the following compounds (1) to (3) shown in Table 1, more preferably, a monomer of the compound (1), and G in the compound (1) may be preferably selected from CH2, 0, S and NH. In particular, among the hydrophilic material monomers, the monomer of Compound (1) may have various functional groups introduced thereinto and good affinity in vivo, and induce a little immune response, thereby having excellent bio-compatibility, and further, may increase stability in vivo of the oligonucleotide included in the structure of Structural Formula (7) or (8), and may increase delivery efficiency, which is significantly suitable for producing the structure according to the present invention. TABLE 1 Monomer structure of hydrophilic material in the present invention Compound (1) Compound (2) Compound (3) In particular, the hydrophilic material in Structural Formulas (5) to (8) preferably has total molecular weight of 1,000 to 2,000. Therefore, for example, when hexaethylene glycol represented by Compound (1), that is, G is O, and m is 6, is used in Structural Formulas (7) and (8), a molecular weight of hexaethylene glycol spacer is 344, such that the repeating number (n) is preferred to be 3 to 5. In particular, the repeating unit of the hydrophilic group, that is, hydrophilic material block, represented by (A\u2032m-J) or (J-A\u2032m)n in Structural Formulas (5) and (6), is capable of being used in an appropriate number represented by n, as needed. A which is the hydrophilic material monomer and J which is the linker included in each hydrophilic material block may be independently the same as each other or be different from each other. That is, when 3 hydrophilic material blocks are used (n=3), the hydrophilic material monomer of the compound (1) is used in the first block, the hydrophilic material monomer of the compound (2) is used in the second block, the hydrophilic material monomer of the compound (3) is used in the third block, etc. That is, different hydrophilic material monomers for all hydrophilic material blocks may be used, and any one hydrophilic material monomer selected from the hydrophilic material monomers of compounds (1) to (3) may also be equally used in all hydrophilic material blocks. Similarly, linkers mediating the combination of the hydrophilic material monomer may also be same as each other or different from each other for all hydrophilic material blocks. Further, m which is the number of hydrophilic material monomers may be the same as each other or different from each other among all hydrophilic material blocks. That is, 3 hydrophilic material monomers (m=3) are connected in the first hydrophilic material block, 5 hydrophilic material monomers (m=5) are connected in the second hydrophilic material block, 4 hydrophilic material monomers (m=4) are connected in the third hydrophilic material block, etc. That is, hydrophilic material monomers each having different numbers or each having the same number may be used in all hydrophilic material blocks. Further, in the present invention, the linker (J) is preferably selected from the group consisting of PO3, SO3 and CO2, but the present invention is not limited thereto. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that any linker may be used depending on the used hydrophilic material monomer, etc., as long as it meets the objects of the present invention. The hydrophobic material (B) in Structural Formulas (1) to (4), (7) and (8) serves to form a nanoparticle formed of the oligonucleotide structures according to Structural Formulas (1) to (4), (7) and (8) through hydrophobic interaction. The hydrophobic material preferably has a molecular weight of 250 to 1,000, and may include a steroid derivative, a glyceride derivative, glycerol ether, polypropylene glycol, C12 to C50 unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon, diacylphosphatidylcholine, fatty acid, phospholipid, lipopolyamine, etc., but the present invention is not limited thereto. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that any hydrophobic material may be used as long as it meets the objects of the present invention. The steroid derivative may be selected from the group consisting of cholesterol, cholestanol, cholic acid, cholesteryl formate, cholestanyl formate, and cholesteryl amine, and the glyceride derivative may be selected from mono-, di- and tri-glyceride, etc., wherein the fatty acid of the glyceride is preferred to be C12 to C50 unsaturated or saturated fatty acid. In particular, among the hydrophobic materials, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon or cholesterol is preferred since it is capable of easily being bonded in a synthetic step of the oligonucleotide structure according to the present invention, and C24 hydrocarbon, particularly, tetradocosane including a disulfide bond is the most preferred. The hydrophobic material is bonded to the distal end of the hydrophilic material, and it does not matter if the hydrophobic material is bonded to any position of the sense strand or the antisense strand of the siRNA. The hydrophilic material or the hydrophobic material in Structural Formulas (1) to (4), (7) and (8) according to the present invention is bonded to the CTGF, Cyr61, or Plekho1-specific siRNA by a simple covalent bond or a linker-mediated covalent bond (X or Y). In addition, the linker mediating the covalent bond is covalently bonded to the hydrophilic material or the hydrophobic material at the end of the CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA, and is not particularly limited as long as the bond that is possible to be decomposed in a specific environment is provided as needed. Therefore, any compound for the binding to activate the CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA and\/or the hydrophilic material (or the hydrophobic material) in production of the double-helical oligo RNA structure according to the present invention, may be used as the linker. The covalent bond may be any one of a non-degradable bond or a degradable bond. Here, examples of the non-degradable bond may include an amide bond or a phosphorylation bond, and examples of the degradable bond may include a disulfide bond, an acid degradable bond, an ester bond, an anhydride bond, a biodegradable bond or an enzymatically degradable bond, and the like, but the present invention is not limited thereto. In addition, any CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA represented by R (or S and AS) in Structural Formulas (1) to (4), (7), and (8) is usable without limitation as long as it is siRNA capable of being specifically bonded to CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1. Preferably, the CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA consists of a sense strand including any one sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 600 and 602 to 604 and an antisense strand including a complementary sequence thereto.

This makes it easy to perform intercellular introduction and escape from the endosome of the double helical-oligo RNA structure containing the CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA according to the present invention, and a possibility of introducing an amine group and using a polyhistidine group to easily perform the intercellular introduction and the escape from the endosome of the carriers such as Quantum dot, Dendrimer, liposome, etc., and the effect thereof, have been reported. Specifically, it is known that the primary amine group expressed at the end or the outside of the carrier is protonated in vivo pH to form a conjugate with a negatively charged gene by an electrostatic interaction, and the escape from the endosome is easily performed due to internal tertiary amines having a buffer effect at a low pH of the endosome after being introduced into the cells, thereby being capable of protecting the carrier from decomposition of lysosome (gene delivery and expression inhibition using a polymer-based hybrid material. Polymer Sci. Technol., Vol. 23, No. 3, pp 254-259). In addition, it is known that histidine which is one of non-essential amino acids, has an imidazole ring (pKa3 6.04) at a residue (-R) to increase a buffer capacity in the endosome and the lysosome, such that histidine expression may be used to increase an escape efficiency from the endosome in non-viral gene carriers including liposome (Novel histidine-conjugated galactosylated cationic liposomes for efficient hepatocyte selective gene transfer in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. J. Controlled Release 118, pp 262-270). The amine group or the polyhistidine group may be linked to the hydrophilic material or the hydrophilic material block through at least one linker.

J1 and J2 are linkers and may be each independently selected from a simple covalent bond, PO3, SO3, CO2, C212 alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl, but the present invention is not limited thereto. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that any linker is usable as J1 and J2 as long as it meets the objects of the present invention depending on the used hydrophilic material. Preferably, when the amine group is introduced, J2 is preferably a simple covalent bond or PO3\u2212, and J1 is preferably C6 alkyl, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Further, when the polyhistidine group is introduced, in Structural Formula (9), J2 is preferably a simple covalent bond or PO3, and J1 is preferably the following Compound (4), but the present invention is not limited thereto.

In particular, in Structural Formulas (10) and (11), the hydrophilic material is preferably bonded to 3\u2032 end of the sense strand of the CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA, and in this case, Structural Formulas (9) to (11) may be represented by the following Structural Formulas (12) to (14): P-J1-J2-A-X-3'S5\u2032-Y-B AS Structural Formula 12 P-J1-J2-(A\u2032m-J)n-X-3\u2032S5\u2032-Y-B AS Structural Formula 13 P-J1-J2-(J-A\u2032m)n-X-3\u2032S5\u2032-Y-B AS Structural Formula 14 In Structural Formulas (12) to (14), X, R, Y, B, A, A\u2032 J, m, n, P, J1 and J2 are the same as being defined in Structural Formulas (9) to (11), and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 mean 5\u2032 end and 3\u2032 end of the sense strand of the CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1-specific siRNA. The amine group that may be introduced in the present invention may be primary to tertiary amine groups, and the primary amine group is particularly preferred.

In addition to histidine, at least one cystein may be additionally included. Meanwhile, when a targeting moiety is provided in the double-helical oligo RNA structure containing the CTGF, Cyr61, or Plekho1-specific siRNA according to the present invention and the nanoparticle formed therefrom, delivery to the target cell is effectively promoted to achieve delivery to the target cell even in a relatively low concentration of dosage, thereby showing a high control function for target gene expression, and thereby preventing non-specific delivery of the CTGF, Cyr61, or Plekho1-specific siRNA into other organs and cells. Accordingly, the present invention provides a double-helical oligo RNA structure in which a ligand (L), particularly, a ligand specifically bonded to a receptor that promotes target cell internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME), is additionally bonded to the structure according to Structural Formulas (1) to (4), (7) and (8). For example, the form in which the ligand is bonded to the double-helical oligo RNA structure according to Structural Formula (1), has a structure represented by the following Structural Formula (15): (Li-Z)-A-X-R-Y-B Structural Formula 15 In Structural Formula (15), A, B, X and Y are the same as being defined in Structural Formula (1), L is a ligand specifically bonded to a receptor that promotes target cell internalization through receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME), and i represents an integer from 1 to 5, preferably, an integer of 1 to 3.

After step (5) above, when the production is completed, it may be confirmed whether the purified RNA-polymer structure and the purified RNA single strand are produced as the desired RNA-polymer structure and the desired RNA single strand by measuring molecular weights by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. In the production method, Step (4) which is a step of synthesizing the RNA single strand having a complementary sequence to a sequence of the RNA single strand synthesized in Step (2) may be performed before Step (1) or may be performed during any one step of Steps (1) to (5). In addition, the RNA single strand having a complementary sequence to the RNA single strand synthesized in Step (2) may contain a phosphate group bonded to 5\u2032 end thereof. Meanwhile, the present invention provides a method for producing a double-helical oligo RNA structure in which a ligand is additionally bonded to the double-helical oligo RNA structure containing the CTGF, Cyr61, or Plekho1-specific siRNA. The method for producing the double-helical oligo RNA structure containing the ligand-bonded CTGF, Cyr61, or Plekho1-specific siRNA according to the present invention may include the following steps: (1) binding a hydrophilic material to a solid support containing a functional group bonded thereto; (2) synthesizing an RNA single strand based on the solid support containing a functional group-hydrophilic material bonded thereto; (3) covalently binding a hydrophilic material to 5\u2032 end of the RNA single strand; (4) synthesizing an RNA single strand having a complementary sequence to a sequence of the RNA single strand; (5) separating a functional group-RNA-polymer structure and the RNA single strand having the complementary sequence from the solid support when the synthesizing of the RNA single strand is completed; (6) producing a ligand-RNA-polymer structure single strand by binding a ligand to an end of the hydrophilic material using the functional group; and (7) producing a ligand-double-helical oligo RNA structure by annealing the ligand-RNA-polymer structure and an RNA single strand having a complementary sequence thereto. After step (6) above, when the production is completed, whether the desired ligand-double-helical oligo RNA structure and the desired RNA single strand having a complementary sequence thereto are prepared may be confirmed by separating and purifying the ligand-RNA-polymer structure and the RNA single strand having a complementary sequence thereto, and measuring molecular weights by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The ligand-double-helical oligo RNA structure may be produced by annealing the prepared ligand-RNA-polymer structure and the RNA single strand having a complementary sequence thereto.

EXAMPLES Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the following Examples. These examples are only for exemplifying the present invention, and it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the scope of the present invention is not construed to be limited to these examples. Example 1 Design of Target Sequence of CTGF, Cyr61 or Plekho1 and Production of siRNA 604 types of target sequences (sense strands) capable of being bonded to mRNA sequence of CTGF (Homo sapiens) gene (NM_001901), mRNA sequence of Cyr61 (Homo sapiens) gene (NM_001554), mRNA sequence of Plekho1 (Homo sapiens) gene (NM_016274), mRNA sequence of CTGF (Mus musculus) gene (NM_010217), mRNA sequence of Cyr61 (Mus musculus) gene (NM_010516), or mRNA sequence of Plekho1 (Mus musculus) gene (NM_023320) were designed, and siRNAs of antisense strands having complementary sequences to the target sequences were produced. First, a gene design program (Turbo si-Designer) developed by Bioneer Co., was used to design target sequence that the siRNA is capable of being bonded from mRNA sequences of the corresponding genes. The siRNA for respiratory disease-related genes according to the present invention has a double stranded structure including a sense strand consisting of 19 nucleotides and an antisense strand complementary thereto. Further, siCONT (having sequence of SEQ ID NO: 601 as a sense strand) which is siRNA having a sequence in which expression of any gene is not inhibited, was produced. The siRNA was produced by linking phosphodiester bonds forming an RNA backbone structure by using J-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite (Nucleic Acids Research, 12:4539-4557, 1984). Specifically, a reaction product including RNA having a desired length was obtained by repeating a series of processes of deblocking, coupling, oxidation and capping, on a solid support to which nucleotide is attached, using RNA synthesizer (384 Synthesizer, BIONEER, Korea). RNA of the reaction product was separated and purified by HPLC LC918 (Japan Analytical Industry, Japan) equipped with Daisogel C18 (Daiso, Japan) column, and it was confirmed whether or not the purified RNA meets the target sequence by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Then, the desired double-stranded siRNA (SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 604) was produced by binding the RNA sense strand to the RNA antisense strand. Example 2 Production of Double-Helical Oligo RNA Structure (PEG-SAMiRNA) The double-helical oligo RNA structure (PEG-SAMiRNA) produced in the present invention has a structure represented by the following Structural Formula (16): C24-5\u2032-S-3\u2032-PEG AS Structural Formula 16 In Structural Formula (16), S is a sense strand of siRNA; AS is an antisense strand of siRNA; PEG is a hydrophilic material, that is, polyethylene glycol; C24 is a hydrophobic material and tetradocosane including a disulfide bond; and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 mean directions of the double-helical oligo RNA end. The sense strand of siRNA of Structural Formula (16) was produced by synthesizing a double-helical oligo RNA-hydrophilic material structure of a sense strand in which polyethylene glycol is bonded to 3\u2032 end by the above-described method in which phosphodiester bonds forming an RNA backbone structure are linked by using J-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite, based on 3\u2032 polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mn=2,000)-CPG produced by Example 1 of Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 10-2012-0119212, as a supporter, and binding tetradocosane including a disulfide bond to 5\u2032 end, thereby producing a sense strand of a desired RNA-polymer structure. For an antisense strand in which annealing is performed with the sense strand, the antisense strand having a complementary sequence to the sense strand was produced by the above-described reaction. When the synthesis was completed, the RNA single strand and the RNA-polymer structure synthesized by treating 28% (v\/v) ammonia in water bath at 60\u00b0 C. were separated from CPG and protecting moieties were removed therefrom by a deprotection reaction, respectively. The RNA single strand and the RNA-polymer structure from which the protecting moieties were removed were treated with N-methylpyrrolidone, triethylamine and triethylaminetrihydrofluoride at a volume ratio of 10:3:4 in an oven at 70\u00b0 C., to remove 2\u2032 TBDMS(tert-butyldimethylsilyl). RNA of the reaction product was separated and purified by HPLC LC918 (Japan Analytical Industry, Japan) equipped with Daisogel C18 (Daiso, Japan) column, and it was confirmed whether or not the purified RNA meets the target sequence by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Then, to produce each double-helical oligo RNA structure, the sense strand and the antisense strand each having the same amount were mixed with each other, put in 1\u00d7 annealing buffer (30 mM HEPES, 100 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, pH 7.0\u02dc7.5), and reacted in a constant-temperature water bath at 90\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, and reacted again at 37\u00b0 C., thereby producing each double-helical oligo RNA structure including siRNA having sequence of SEQ ID NO: 42, 59, 602, 124, 153, 187, 197, 212, 218, 221, 223, 323, 424, 525 or 601 as the sense strand (hereinafter, referred to as SAMiRNALP-hCTGF, SAMiRNALP-hCyr, SAMiRNALP-hPlek, SAMiRNALP-mCTGF, SAMiRNALP-mCyr, and SAMiRNALP-mPlek SAMiRNALP-CONT, respectively). It was confirmed that the produced double-helical oligo RNA structure was annealed by electrophoresis. Example 3 Production of Improved Double-Helical Oligo RNA Structure (Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA) The improved double-helical oligo RNA structure produced in the present invention is obtained by using [PO3\u2212-hexaethylene glycol]4 (hereinafter, referred to as \u2018Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA\u2019, see Structural Formula (17)) which is the hydrophilic material block instead of using PEG which is the hydrophilic material, and has the following Structure Formula (17): C24-5-S-3\u2032-[(Hexa Ethylene Glycol)-PO3\u2212]4 AS Structure Formula 17 In Structural Formula (17), S is a sense strand of siRNA; AS is an antisense strand of siRNA; [Hexa Ethylene Glycol]4 is a hydrophilic material monomer; C24 is a hydrophobic material and tetradocosane including a disulfide bond; and 5 \u2032 and 3\u2032 mean directions of the double-helical oligo RNA sense strand end. The structure of Mono-HEG SAMiRNA according to Structural Formula (17) may be represented by the following Structural Formula (18): RNA of the reaction product was separated and purified by HPLC LC918 (Japan Analytical Industry, Japan) equipped with Daisogel C18 (Daiso, Japan) column, and it was confirmed whether or not the purified RNA meets the target sequence by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Then, to produce each double-helical oligo RNA structure, the sense strand and the antisense strand each having the same amount were mixed with each other, put in 1\u00d7 annealing buffer (30 mM HEPES, 100 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, pH 7.0\u02dc7.5), and reacted in a constant-temperature water bath at 90\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, and reacted again at 37\u00b0 C., thereby producing each double-helical oligo RNA structure including siRNA having sequence of SEQ ID NO: 42, 59, 602, 124, 153, 187, 197, 212, 218, 221, 223, 323, 424, 525 or 601 as the sense strand (hereinafter, referred to as Mono-HEG-SAMiRNALP-hCTGF, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNALP-hCyr, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNALP-hPlek, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNALP-mCTGF, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNALP-mCyr, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNALP-mPlek, and Mono-HEG-SAMiRNALP-CONT, respectively). It was confirmed that the produced double-helical oligo RNA structure was annealed by electrophoresis. Example 4 Production of Nanoparticles Formed of Improved Double-Helical Oligo RNA Structure (Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA) and Measurement of Size Thereof The double-helical oligo RNA structure (Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA) produced by Example 3 forms a nanoparticle, that is, micelle by a hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic materials bonded to the end of the double-helical oligo RNA (FIG. 1). It was confirmed that the nanoparticle (SAMiRNA) formed of the corresponding Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA was formed by analyzing PDI (polydispersity index) of the nanoparticles formed of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-hCTGF, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-hCyr, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-hPlek, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-mCTGF, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-mCyr, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-mPlek and Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-CONT. Example 4-1 Production of Nanoparticle The Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-hCTGF was dissolved in 1.5 ml DPBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline) at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg\/ml, the obtained mixture was freeze-dried at \u221275\u00b0 C. and 5 mTorr condition for 48 hours to produce nanoparticle powder, and the nanoparticle powder was dissolved in DPBS which is a solvent to produce homogenized nanoparticles. The nanoparticles formed of Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-hCyr, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-hPlek, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-mCTGF, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-mCyr, Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-mPlek, and Mono-HEG-SAMiRNA-CONT were produced by the same method. Example 4-2 Measurement of Size and Polydispersity Index (PDI) of Nanoparticle A size of the nanoparticle was measured by zeta-potential measurement. A size of the homogenized nanoparticles produced by Example 4-1 was measured by zeta-potential measurement (Nano-ZS, MALVERN, England), under conditions in which a refractive index to the material is 1.459, an absorption index is 0.001, a temperature of a solvent: DPBS is 25\u00b0 C. and the corresponding viscosity and refractive index are 1.0200 and 1.335, respectively. Once measurement was conducted by a size measurement including repeating 15 times and then repeating six times. As the PDI value is decreased, the corresponding particles become uniformly distributed, and thus, it could be appreciated that the nanoparticles of the present invention have a significantly uniform size.

Meanwhile, 3.5 \u03bcl of Lipofectamine\u2122 RNAi Max (Invitrogen, USA) was mixed with 246.5 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM medium to prepare a mixed solution, and the mixed solution was reacted at room temperature for 5 minutes. siRNA solutions each having a final concentration of 5 or 20 nM were prepared by adding 5 or 20 \u03bcl of siRNAs (1 pmole\/\u03bcl) having sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 10, 101 to 110, 201 to 210 and 601 by Example 1, as the sense strand, to 230 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM medium. The Lipofectamine\u2122 RNAi Max mixture and the siRNA solution were mixed and reacted at room temperature for 15 minutes, thereby preparing a solution for transfection. Then, 500 \u03bcl of each transfection solution was dispensed in each well of the tumor cell line containing Opti-MEM dispensed therein, and cultured for 6 hours, and the Opti-MEM medium was removed. Here, 1 ml of RPMI 1640 culture medium was dispensed therein and cultured under condition of 37\u00b0 C. and 5% (v\/v) CO2 for 24 hours. Example 5-3 Quantitative Analysis of Target Gene mRNA cDNA was produced by extracting total RNA from the transfected cell line by Example 5-2, and an mRNA expression amount of the target gene was subjected to relative-quantification by real-time PCR. Example 5-3-1 RNA Separation from Transfected Cell and cDNA Production Total RNA was extracted from the transfected cell line of Example 5-2 by RNA extraction kit (AccuPrep Cell total RNA extraction kit, BIONEER, Korea), and the extracted RNA was used to produce cDNA by RNA reverse transcriptase (AccuPower CycleScript RT Premix\/dT20, Bioneer, Korea) according to the following method. Specifically, 1 \u03bcg of the extracted RNA per each tube was added to AccuPower CycleScript RT Premix\/dT20 (Bioneer, Korea) contained in 0.25 ml Eppendorf tube, and distilled water treated with DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbonate) was added thereto so as to have a total volume of 20 \u03bcl. A process of hybridizing RNA and primers at 30\u00b0 C. for 1 minute by a gene amplifier (MyGenie\u2122 96 Gradient Thermal Block, BIONEER, Korea) and a process of producing cDNA at 52\u00b0 C. for 4 minutes were repeated 6 times, and then, an amplification reaction was completed by inactivating the enzyme at 90\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. Example 5-3-2 Relative-Quantitative Analysis of Target Gene mRNA A relative amount of the respiratory disease-related gene mRNA was quantified by the following method through real-time PCR having the cDNA produced by Example 5-3-1 as a template. cDNA produced by Example 5-3-1 was diluted 5 times with distilled water in each well of 96-well plate. Then, 3 \u03bcl of the diluted cDNA, 25 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 GreenStar\u2122 PCR master mix (BIONEER, Korea), 19 \u03bcl of distilled water, and 3 \u03bcl of qPCR primers (Table 2; F and R each having 10 pmole\/\u03bcl; BIONEER, Korea) were added thereto to prepare each mixed solution. Meanwhile, RPL13A (ribosomal protein L13a) which is a housekeeping gene (hereinafter, referred to as HK gene) was determined as a standard gene to normalize the expression amount of the target gene mRNA. The following reaction was performed on 96-well plate containing the mixture by Exicycler\u2122 96 Real-Time Quantitative Thermal Block (BIONEER, Korea). After the reaction at 95\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes to activate the enzyme and remove a secondary structure of cDNA, four processes including a process of denaturing at 94\u00b0 C. for 30 seconds, a process of annealing at 58\u00b0 C. for 30 seconds, a process of extension at 72\u00b0 C. for 30 seconds, and a process of SYBR green scan were repeated 42 times, and final extension was performed at 72\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes. Then, the temperature was maintained at 55\u00b0 C. for 1 minute, and a melting curve was analyzed from 55\u00b0 C. up to 95\u00b0 C. After PCR was completed, for Ct (threshold cycle) value of each of the obtained target gene, Ct values of the target gene corrected through GAPDH gene were calculated, and then the difference (\u0394Ct) was obtained by using a test group treated with siRNA (SEQ ID NO: 601, siCONT) having a control sequence preventing inhibition of gene expression, as a control group. The expression amount of the target gene of the cell treated with the CTGF (Homo sapiens)-specific siRNA (having sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 10 as the sense strand) was relatively quantified by using the \u0394Ct value and calculation formula 2(\u2212\u0394Ct)\u00d7100 (FIG. 2A).

Here, 1 m of RPMI 1640 culture medium was dispensed therein and cultured under condition of 37\u00b0 C. and 5% (v\/v) CO2 for 24 hours. Example 11-3 Quantitative Analysis of Target Gene mRNA cDNA was produced by extracting total RNA from the transfected cell line by Example 11-2 through the same method as Example 5-3, and an mRNA expression amount of the target gene was subjected to relative quantification by real-time PCR. The expression amount of the target gene of the cell treated with the CTGF (Mus musculus)-specific siRNA (SEQ ID NO: 307) or treated with the CTGF (Homo sapiens)-specific siRNA (SEQ ID NO: 4, 5, 6, 8 or 9) was relatively quantified (FIG. 9A).

{"patent_number":"14902567","decision":"REJECTED","title":"BEARING AND GEAR UNIT FOR WIND TURBINES","abstract":"The economic efficiency of wind turbines improves by upscaling but the weight to strength ratio deteriorates. This is especially true for the large shaft and bearing of the rotor, the gearbox and the generator. Solutions to this was the gearless generator, getting heavy because the amount of magnetic material is inversely proportional to speed, or several smaller generators adapted to the wind on a distribution gear as shown in references (1), (2) and (3). The large roller bearing of the rotor has relatively large bearing clearance so only the top or lower rollers bear the entire weight of the rotor and thus must be dimensioned relatively large. The present invention spreads the load on the support bearing to more rollers and to smaller faster running and thereby lighter generators. It has the rotor attached to the outer ring, each roller rotatably mounted to the nacelle and the inner ring free wheeling. The outer and inner rings are relatively stiffer than the rotatable fixation of the upper rollers to the nacelle, so that the upper rollers flex slightly down under the weight of the rotor allowing some of the force of gravity to be transferred to the inner ring and on to the bottom relatively stiff journalled rollers. Gear teeth can be used to transfer torque to all rollers, or the inner ring pressed against the side rollers, or the conical rollers can be pressed dynamically in between the outer and inner ring with relatively constant force. This is shown in FIGS. 1 and 6 in perspective and FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, in radial section. The relatively small roller shafts can now be used as PTO with gear ratio bearing diameter to roller diameter. The cost of the extra bearings for each roller is offset by savings in the usual center shaft and gear. Also, the friction from the edge of the outer or inner ring to keep the large rollers in place is missing. These benefits are especially important for wind turbines with heavy hub, axle and gear on a tall tower, and large wing rotor bearing clearance causing inappropriate vibrations of the long components. With no central hub shaft, gear and generator in the nacelle center there is space for force carrying structures as strong as the top of the tower to a point on the centre line of the rotor in front of it. To this a bearing for sustaining the varying moments of the wind can be affixed so the weight carrying bearing and gear unit can be designed cylindrical; or stays can be continued to other tower elements achieving a tower structure with significantly lower weight and higher natural frequency than usual wind moment influenced single column towers.","claims":"1.

The purpose of the present invention is therefore to save about one half of said non force resisting mass that is about 10% by weight of the nacelle. Maybe not a large number, but it may have relatively large significance moving the natural frequency of the tower-nacelle above the excitation from the wings. PRIOR ART Gearless wind turbines with multipole generators on the rotor shaft is prior art. The complexity of many poles and a large amount of heavy magnetic material is needed to compensate for the low speed range, but the weight and complexity of the central gear unit is saved. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The combined bearing and gear unit according to the invention also saves the central rotor shaft as PTO from the individual rollers of the only remaining bearing provide the equivalent of traditional first-stage gearing. One embodiment is to attach many relatively small mass-produced generators, one on each PTO to facilitate the many poles relatively inexpensively. If the bearings 6 and 7 of FIGS. 1 to 6 for the individual roller shafts are firmly rooted in the nacelle the upper quarter must be able to support the whole weight of the rotor attached to the outer ring 2. Otherwise, a free counter-rotating inner ring as shown in FIG. 6, can transfer half of this weight to the lower rollers when the rollers are fixated to the nacelle with a smaller stiffness than the stiffness of the inner ring. Alternatively, a fixed inner ring can support the total weight of the rotor so that the bearings 6 and 7 between the rings 1 and 2 of FIG. 1 only have to resist the outward pressing force from the conical rollers. A drawback of this embodiment is that the power must then be transmitted via slip rings because the assembly of rollers between the rings rotate at half speed and the gearing is also half of the aforementioned alternatives. The problem of uneven transfer of power and rotor weight to rollers distant from the top can also be reduced by springs pushing them tighter into the space between the inner and outer ring in positions below the top. And reduced even more if it is an active push in the axial direction of each roller controlled by actuators. The cost of these is outweighed by longer bearing life from constant load, less bearing wear and higher performance due to the lower bearing friction that can be dynamically lowered at the frequent low wind speeds, where the demands on the bearing support of wind shear loads are smaller. Under these conditions the friction is least if the lower rollers are not squeezed in between the rings and thus do not get friction forces transmitted to the bottom generators or motors, so that they are coupled off the power output. Conversely the load carrying top rollers are most compressed, thereby rotating quicker with the greatest friction force with most power output potential, which fits fairly well with common electrical characteristics of generators. The changing forces of the wind can be absorbed by having opposed pairs of rollers in the opposing conical surfaces between inner and outer ring from either side. One embodiment has generators mounted on the individual roller shafts outside of the rings as shown in FIG. 3, so that this bearing and gear unit replaces the usual rotor shaft with associated bearings, central gear and generator in wind turbines. For a 7 MW turbine, this requires a \u00d8 15 m bearing unit in order to have sufficient friction on the rollers to transfer the total torque. In another embodiment the outer conical end of the rollers are provided with teeth similar to planet gears so that the friction is not a limiting factor, whereby the diameter of the bearing unit comes down to 8 m. A third embodiment shown in FIG. 3 has yet another planetary gear stage succeeding this, and the permanent magnet generators offset each other shown FIG. 5, whereby the bearing unit diameter comes down to 5 m. As shown in Annex 2 the smaller rollers however increases the friction loss from approximately 8% for the large diameter 15 m bearing to 9% and 10% respectively for the smaller ones. It is also possible to have teeth on only some of the rollers with freewheeling gear wheels between these to transmit power to a central generator shown in FIG. 6. When the wind increases the necessary frictional force similarly increases by the outer ring being pressed up against the rollers sufficiently small cone angle, as calculated in Annex 2 and the sprockets teeth can be successively wider going up to the central wheel 11 to achieve constant loads with least weight. A fourth embodiment has motors fitted to the individual rotor shafts outside of the rings with spring- or actuator pretensioned bearings, so that this bearing and gear unit replaces the yaw turntable with associated motors and brakes for the nacelle or pitch turntable for individual wings in wind turbines. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows the bearing and gear unit in 3D perspective. FIG. 2 is a section of 1 showing rollers and their bearings in detail. FIG. 3 elaborates FIG. 2 with another gear stage and generator. FIG. 4 is a detailed axially symmetric view of FIG. 3 FIG. 5 shows gears and generators offset, tightly spaced. FIG. 6 show rollers and gears supported by a freewheeling inner ring. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In FIGS. 1, 1 and 2 are the inner and outer ring where 1 for a 7MW turbine has a distance of two and a half meters to the bearing center axis in the direction of the wind. 4 is the intermediate ring spacer to which the rollers 5 are attached with bearings 6 and 7. FIG. 2 is the corresponding radial section along A-A of FIG. 1 where also a part of the load bearing connection 3 between the two opposed portions of the spacer ring 4 is shown behind roller 5 In FIG. 3, the load bearing connection 3 is formed as a central freewheeling ring between rings 1 and 2 to which the shafts 4 of the opposing rollers, gears and generators 20 are rigidly fixed. FIG. 4 shows a rotationally symmetric section through two opposing roller gear generator units 20 along their axis of symmetry 19. The axial roller bearing 7 supplies the necessary back pressure for the conical roller 5, whose second support is the bearing 6. Concentric with the left extension of 5 with the same shading the planet gear 8 may turn slightly compared to 5 The planet gear 8 is in engagement with the teeth on the outer ring 2 and possibly also the inner ring 1 (in this case corresponding to a sun gear), and has the same taper mesh circle as the conical roller 5. If the manufacturing accuracy was ideal there would be no need for the loose very slowly rotating fit between 5 and 8, because they would rotate at the same speed. The teeth are really only needed for a 7MW turbine when the inner ring diameter is less than 15 meters, which would otherwise allow the transfer of the total torque using a traction oil with friction coefficient of 0.1 as shown in Annex 1. From the planet wheel 8 extends one or more shafts 9 to the next stage planetary gear wheel 10 which is in engagement with the toothing of the outer ring 16 and the sun gear 11. This is journalled in a needle bearing 13 just below the planetary wheel and a ball bearing 12 at the other end. Affixed on the sun gear 11 is the generator rotor 14, while its stator 15 is fixed to the outer cover 16, whose left end is rigidly secured to the roller shaft 4 while the other is supported radially by a bearing 17 on the central shaft of the sun gear 11 The outer cover 16 which in some embodiments rotates at half the speed of the outer ring 2 fits close against this and the inner ring with fx a labyrinth seal 18 which allows an oil bath around the planet wheels 10 and 8. An additional oil reservoir can be established in the outer ring 2 or behind the bearings 7 and 12. In the embodiment where the outer cover with the stator rotates relative to the inner ring, it is necessary to transfer the power using slip rings. However, it is enough with slip rings on one side of the bearing-gear unit as the current from the generators of the other side can be passed through the hollow roller shafts 4. Each of the 72 one hundred kilowatt roller, gear and generator units 20 required for a 7 MW turbine can be fabricated and assembled as separate entities. These units are mounted between the free-hanging outer 2 and inner ring 1 by bolting their central shaft 4 to the cage ring holder 3 from both sides. This provides for establishing a predefined bearing clearance which can be restored by tightening after bearing wear. Hereby the extra wear and tear is avoided of conventional large bearings from the edges of the hole for inserting rollers as well as the roller's friction against the edge of the outer or inner ring necessary to keep the rollers in place. FIG. 5 along the section B-B of FIG. 1 shows how a shorter version of the roller, gear and generator unit 21 can be mounted in the constriction of the outer cover 16 of 20 with a minimal gap between them providing for a compact design. To make room for 36 generators for a 7 MW turbine on one side of a 5 m diameter bearing and gear unit it is necessary to make this constriction of the outer cover between 16 and 17 for every second generator to be seated herein closer to the rotor bearing. FIG. 6 shows how the free wheeling inner ring 1 transmits forces from the outer ring 2 on the upper rollers 5a to the bottom rollers 8a. The inner ring supports only the rollers that feel increased force when the wind from the right increases, and they are rotatably fixated to the nacelle by bearings on both sides of the inner ring at positions 6 and 7. There are only weight supporting rollers on the upper respectively lower quarter and they transfer power to each other via the attached gear 9 to the intermediate gear 10 and last to the central upper respectively lower gear 11. The last two can then transfer the geared power via two vertical shafts 12 to a central bevel gear 13 on a central generator 14. They rollers necessary for preventing yaw and pitch of the outer ring are not shown, but they are fitted like the rollers 5 in FIG. 1 in four equally spaced positions on the right inner conical surface of the outer ring 15.","cpc_label":"F03D110008","ipc_label":"F03D1102","filing_date":"20160102","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20160602","examiner_id":"","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: the present invention is therefore to save about one half of said non force resisting mass that is about 10% by weight of the nacelle., in the context of the novelty:  The economic efficiency of wind turbines improves by upscaling but the weight to strength ratio deteriorates .

There are 74 countries in the world that are endowed with coalbed gas resources, while China boasts coalbed gas reserve up to 36.8 trillion cubic meters, ranking No. 3 in the world; China has exploitable coalbed gas resources of about 10 trillion cubic meters. Nowadays, values of such unconventional resource has been recognized; the exploration and utilization of coalbed gas resources have been gradually progressing all over the world. In the extraction process of coalbed gas, a large amount of coalbed water contained in coalbeds may cause excessively high pressure at the bottom of the coalbed gas well, so that the coalbed gas cannot flow into the well shaft. Therefore, it is required to discharge the coalbed water so as to reduce the pressure at the bottom of the coalbed gas well. In this way, the coalbed gas is able to continuously flow into the well shaft due to a pressure difference generated thereby. In addition, the production characteristics of coalbed gas requires that the coalbed water be stably drained with a reasonable drainage and extraction strength. Due to various restrictions such as topographic conditions, investment scale and national land policies, the drilling mode of multi-well cluster (multiple wells drilled in a well site) is increasingly adopted. As determined by this specific drilling mode, the vast majority of coalbed gas wells have inclined shafts. Combined with a shallow burial depth of coalbed that dictates a small hole curvature radius of the coalbed gas well, the following problems are resulted in the drainage and extraction process of coalbed water. Firstly, the coal gas well is greatly sloped and having a small hole curvature radius. Even the existing vertical wells have such problems as serious hole deviation and high rate of overall angle change. The commonly used sucker-rod pumps (e.g., tubing pumps and screw pumps) thus suffer from serous abrasion of rods and tubes, resulting in high consumption of rod and tube materials as well as frequent workover operations. Secondly, the output coalbed water contains coal dust and fracturing sand (this is because all the coal gas wells are put to production after fracturing).

Implementations of the present disclosure relate to a method for extracting coalbed gas through a water and coal dust drainage, which is so designed that the water and coal dust contained in the coalbed can be sufficiently sucked into a hydraulic jet pump and then discharged to the surface of the ground. The implementations further relate to a device for realizing the method described above. The implementations include: a method for extracting coalbed gas through a water and coal dust drainage. The method involves providing a power fluid into a downhole power fluid pipe in a well shaft via a wellhead device. The wellhead device is provided with a flow channel system such that the power fluid is transported into a hydraulic jet pump disposed inside a pump cylinder connected with the downhole power fluid pipe. Accordingly, the hydraulic jet pump starts to work to suck a formation fluid into the hydraulic jet pump through a suction inlet at a lower part of the hydraulic jet pump. The method also involves forming a mixed fluid by mixing the formation fluid with the power fluid. The method further involves transporting the mixed fluid upwards to ground, wherein the mixed fluid contains coal dust. The mixed fluid is transported by a downhole mixed fluid pipe in the well shaft, and the downhole mixed fluid pipe has a small flow channel cross section such that the mixed fluid containing the coal dust flows upward through the wellhead device to the ground at a flow rate higher than a sedimentation rate of the coal dust. Accordingly, a sedimentation of the coal dust is prevented. Also, the pump cylinder reaches a lower boundary of a coalbed, which prevents the coal dust from burying the coalbed. The method still involves collecting the coalbed gas by a ground gas collecting device. The coalbed gas reaches the ground through an annular space inside a shaft casing. In addition, a device for extracting coalbed gas through a water and coal dust drainage according to the present disclosure is realized in the following manner. This device is provided with a wellhead device having a flow channel system. This device is also provided with a power fluid inlet on the wellhead device connected with a downhole power fluid pipe in a shaft casing through the flow channel system in the wellhead device. This device is also provided with a mixed fluid outlet on the wellhead device connected with a downhole mixed fluid pipe in a shaft through the flow channel system in the wellhead device. This device is also provided with a hydraulic jet pump connected with the downhole power fluid pipe and the downhole mixed fluid pipe. The hydraulic jet pump includes a pump cylinder configured to be placed at a lower boundary of a coalbed. When the method for extracting coalbed gas through water and coal dust drainage as well as the device thereof are adopted, the power fluid enters the hydraulic jet pump through the wellhead device and the downhole power fluid pipe. This enables the hydraulic jet pump to operate. The hydraulic jet pump sucks in formation fluid that contains both water and coal dust, and mixes the formation fluid with the power fluid to form a mixed fluid. The mixed fluid is transported upwards to the well head through a downhole mixed fluid pipe and discharged to the ground, completing the drainage and extraction of the coalbed water that contains coal dust. With the discharge of the coalbed water, the bottom-hole pressure of the coalbed gas well (i.e., the pressure at the bottom of the well at the working fluid level) is gradually decreased. When the bottom-hole pressure (at the working fluid level) of the coalbed gas well has dropped to a certain extent, the coalbed gas enters the well shaft under the action of the produced differential pressure. Since the density of the coalbed gas is much less than the density of the coalbed water, the coalbed gas thus moves upwards along an annular space inside the shaft casing and enters the ground gas collecting device through a gas well casing valve. The pump cylinder of the hydraulic jet pump is located at the lower boundary of the coalbed, which prevents the coal dust from burying the coalbed. Since no packer is provided under the well shaft, it is feasible to timely detect and record data such as the casing-head pressure and the working fluid level of the gas well. The speed of water drainage can be reasonably controlled by adjusting technical parameters of the downhole hydraulic jet pump and the pressure of the power fluid, so as to meet the requirement for drainage and extraction of the coalbed water. Furthermore, there is no moving components under the shaft, so there is no issue of sucker rod side-abrasion. Therefore, through the adoption of this method and the device thereof, the drainage and extraction process of coalbed water containing coal dust is simplified, the production cost significantly reduced, and the overall benefits of extracting the coalbed gas enhanced.","description":"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is the U.S. national stage application of International Application No. PCT\/CN2014\/082573, filed on Jul. 21, 2014. The above-identified patent application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to coalbed gas extracting, in particular to methods and devices for extracting coalbed gas from an inclined well shaft which contains also water, coal dust and sand. BACKGROUND Coalbed gas is a self-generating and self-preserving unconventional natural gas in coalbeds. There are 74 countries in the world that are endowed with coalbed gas resources, while China boasts coalbed gas reserve up to 36.8 trillion cubic meters, ranking No. 3 in the world; China has exploitable coalbed gas resources of about 10 trillion cubic meters. Nowadays, values of such unconventional resource has been recognized; the exploration and utilization of coalbed gas resources have been gradually progressing all over the world. In the extraction process of coalbed gas, a large amount of coalbed water contained in coalbeds may cause excessively high pressure at the bottom of the coalbed gas well, so that the coalbed gas cannot flow into the well shaft. Therefore, it is required to discharge the coalbed water so as to reduce the pressure at the bottom of the coalbed gas well. In this way, the coalbed gas is able to continuously flow into the well shaft due to a pressure difference generated thereby. In addition, the production characteristics of coalbed gas requires that the coalbed water be stably drained with a reasonable drainage and extraction strength. Due to various restrictions such as topographic conditions, investment scale and national land policies, the drilling mode of multi-well cluster (multiple wells drilled in a well site) is increasingly adopted. As determined by this specific drilling mode, the vast majority of coalbed gas wells have inclined shafts. Combined with a shallow burial depth of coalbed that dictates a small hole curvature radius of the coalbed gas well, the following problems are resulted in the drainage and extraction process of coalbed water. Firstly, the coal gas well is greatly sloped and having a small hole curvature radius. Even the existing vertical wells have such problems as serious hole deviation and high rate of overall angle change. The commonly used sucker-rod pumps (e.g., tubing pumps and screw pumps) thus suffer from serous abrasion of rods and tubes, resulting in high consumption of rod and tube materials as well as frequent workover operations. Secondly, the output coalbed water contains coal dust and fracturing sand (this is because all the coal gas wells are put to production after fracturing). This leads to frequent faults (such as corrosion of rods, pipes and pumps, pump blocking and stuck pumps) in the existing coalbed water lifting devices (e.g., tubing pumps, screw pumps and electrical submersible pumps), which cause frequent workover operations. Thirdly, most of the coal gas wells have a water yield less than the minimal discharge capacity requirement of electrical submersible pumps, and therefore do not comply with the well selection criteria of electrical submersible pumps. Fourthly, although the operating conditions of sand discharge and oil extraction methods are relatively similar to the technical requirements for coalbed gas extraction through drainage of water and coal dust, the methods have yet to be applied in the field of coalbed gas extraction through water and coal dust drainage. Necessary modifications and improvements are to be made to the technical structure of the well shaft as well as to the methods themselves before they can be applied to coalbed gas extraction through water and coal dust drainage. To sum up, the conventional coalbed water lifting technology employed nowadays would cause frequent workover operations on coalbed gas wells, significantly increasing the production cost of coalbed gas extraction. In addition, the frequent workover operations on coal gas wells may most easily cause damage to the reservoir bed and directly affect the extraction performance of coalbed gas.

FIG. 2 is a structure diagram of a hydraulic jet pump in a power fluid positive circulation mode in a device for extracting coalbed gas through water and coal dust drainage according to the present disclosure. FIG. 3 is a structure diagram of a hydraulic jet pump in a power fluid reverse circulation mode in a device for extracting coalbed gas through water and coal dust drainage according to the present disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present disclosure is described in detail with reference to the attached figures. As shown in the attached figures, a device for extracting coalbed gas through water and coal dust drainage according to the present disclosure is realized in following manner. This device is provided with wellhead device 12 having a flow channel system. Power fluid inlet 2 on the wellhead device is connected with downhole power fluid pipe 7 in shaft casing 5 through the flow channel system in the wellhead device. Mixed fluid outlet 3 on the wellhead device is connected with downhole mixed fluid pipe 6 in the well shaft through the flow channel system in the wellhead device. The downhole power fluid pipe and the downhole mixed fluid pipe are connected with hydraulic jet pump 9. Pump cylinder 10 of the hydraulic jet pump is located at the lower boundary of coalbed. The operating principle of this device is described in view of a positive circulation of the power fluid, as follows. The power fluid of high pressure drives the downhole hydraulic jet pump to work. The flow channel of the downhole mixed pipe has a small cross section area, so that the mixed fluid containing coal dust flows upward to the ground through mixed fluid outlet 3 on the wellhead device at a flow rate much higher than the sedimentation rate of cost dust. As the coalbed water containing coal dust is discharged with control, the coalbed gas is able to continuously flow into the well shaft. Subsequently, under the action of downhole flow pressure at the bottom of the well, the coalbed gas moves along an annular space between shaft casing 5 and downhole power fluid pipe 7, through casing valve 4 of the wellhead device, and eventually reaches the ground and flows onwards. The upward sending of the mixed fluid containing coal dust is completed by the flow channel of the downhole mixed fluid pipe in the well shaft. The flow channel of the downhole mixed fluid pipe has a cross-section area less than a cross-section area of the flow channel of the downhole power fluid pipe, such that the mixed fluid containing coal dust flows upwards at a flow rate much greater than a sedimentation rate of coal dust. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3, a device for extracting coalbed gas through water and coal dust drainage according to the present disclosure is described in view of a reverse circulation of the power fluid, as follows. This device is provided with wellhead device 12 having a flow channel system. Power fluid inlet 2 on the wellhead device is connected with downhole power fluid pipe 7 in shaft casing 5 through the flow channel system in the wellhead device. Mixed fluid outlet 3 on the wellhead device is connected with downhole mixed fluid pipe 6 in the well shaft through the flow channel system in the wellhead device. The downhole power fluid pipe and the downhole mixed fluid pipe are connected with hydraulic jet pump 9. Suction inlet 10 of the downhole hydraulic jet pump is located at the lower boundary of coalbed. The power fluid of high pressure drives the downhole hydraulic jet pump to work. Through an optimized design of the flow channel cross-section area of the downhole mixed fluid pipe, along with a reasonable allocation of the quantity of the power fluid, the mixed fluid containing coal dust is configured to flow upwards at a flow rate much greater than the sedimentation rate of oil reservoir coal dust, thus able to reach the ground through mixed fluid outlet 3 on the wellhead device. As the coalbed water containing coal dust is discharged with control, the coalbed gas is able to continuously flow into the well shaft. Subsequently, under the action of downhole flow pressure at the bottom of the well, the coalbed gas moves along an annular space between shaft casing 5 and downhole power fluid pipe 7, through casing valve 4 of the wellhead device, and eventually reaches the ground and flows onwards. The undermost end of the well shaft is an artificial well bottom 11. When the pump core of the hydraulic jet pump is transported to the downhole, the pulling-running tool 1 on the wellhead device can be used to send the pump core down the downhole power fluid pipe, and the power fluid is then used to send the pump core to the operating position in the pump cylinder. When it is necessary to move the pump core of the hydraulic jet pump out of the downhole and to the ground, power fluid can be injected into the mixed fluid outlet so that the flow direction of the power fluid is opposite to that of the normal operating. This way, the hydraulic jet pump can be sent upwards along the downhole power fluid pipe to the pulling-running tool on the well head, so as to be taken out. As the coalbed water is being discharged, the bottom-hole pressure of the coalbed gas well gradually decreases, which enables the coalbed gas to flow into the well shaft along cracks in the coalbed and then subsequently reach a gas collective device located on the ground through the annular space inside the shaft casing. The high pressure power fluid required by the downhole hydraulic jet pump is provided by a ground power fluid pump. The coalbed water output by the coalbed gas well can be adopted as the power fluid and can be put into cycle use after a simple sedimentation process. The coalbed water output by various coalbeds 8 in the coalbed gas well is discharged to the ground and then enters the water collecting system. As shown in FIG. 2, first O-ring A1 is used for the sealing between the power fluid and the output fluid. Second O-ring B1 is used for the sealing between the output fluid and the mixed fluid. First pump core seat C1 is used to support the hydraulic jet pump core. The power fluid enters the hydraulic jet pump through flow channel D1 of the first power fluid pump core, and the mixed fluid flows out from mixed fluid outlet E1. First nozzle 6.1 is provided in the pump core of the hydraulic jet pump, first throat pipe 6.2 is provided under the first nozzle, and first check valve 6.3 is mounted in first formation fluid inlet F1 at a lower part of the pump body. As shown in FIG. 3, third O-ring A2 is used for sealing between the power fluid and the output fluid. Fourth O-ring B2 is used for the sealing between the power fluid and the output fluid. Second pump core seat C2 is used to support the hydraulic jet pump core. The power fluid enters the hydraulic jet pump through flow channel E2 of the second power fluid pump core, and the mixed fluid flows out from mixed fluid outlet D2. Second nozzle 8.1 is provided in the pump core of the hydraulic jet pump, second throat pipe 8.2 is provided under the second nozzle, and second check valve 8.3 is mounted in second formation fluid inlet F2 at a lower part of the pump body.

Advantageous embodiments or developments of the set according to the present invention are each subject matter of the dependent claims. Embodiments according to the present invention may each comprise one or more of the following features in any arbitrary combination. In some embodiments of the set according to the present invention, altering a form or shape of the implant means reducing or increasing a diameter, in particular an outer diameter, of the implant. Alterations of the diameter may be accompanied by any kind of alteration of the implant's length or any other alteration, or may be not. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, folding the implant means reducing the implant's diameter. In some embodiments according to the present invention, folding is to be understood as increasing a diameter of the implant. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, unfolding means the opposite of folding. In some embodiments according to the present invention, a common aperture is to be understood as a single aperture through which more than one tension thread are commonly guided or passed through. However, in other embodiments according to the invention, a common aperture means a particular site where a pair of tension threads are guided through the circumference of the implant. That common aperture may be subdivided into two or more sub-apertures which, however, all belong to a functionally \u2018common\u2019 passage through the shaft, wall, envelope or circumference of the implant. Two or more sub-apertures may even then be referred to as a common aperture within the sense of the present invention, as long as an angle formed between the pair of tension threads is not substantially changed by the fact the common aperture is comprised by not by one but by a multitude of apertures. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, the term \u2018one (particular) common aperture\u2019 encompasses all apertures that are arranged on one (particular) post or strut, in particular at one and the same spot (of the implant, e. g.) or in either a proximal or distal section thereof. In some embodiments according to the present invention, one or each of the common apertures are provided in one or more posts or struts of the implant which extends in parallel to a longitudinal axis of the implant (e. g. in an unfolded or folded state outside of the body). In certain embodiments according to the present invention, all of the common apertures are provided only in such posts or struts of the implant. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the posts or struts are arranged to connect a distal ring-shaped element of the implant with a proximal ring-shaped element thereof. The posts or struts may be arranged to maintain a distance or an unchangeable distance between the distal and the proximal ring-shaped elements. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, the at least one opening of the shaft fiber is an opening in the end face of the shaft fiber. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the at least one opening of the shaft fiber is an opening in the shaft or circumference or envelope of the shaft fiber. In certain embodiments of the set according to the present invention, the shaft openings of the shaft fibers and the apertures of the implant are matched such that tension threads which pass through one or more shaft opening(s) and which also pass together through a common aperture do not\u2014or not substantially\u2014change the angle between them during folding and\/or unfolding. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the implant, shaft fibers and pairs of tension threads are arranged such that in an area of the shaft openings the respective tension threads (or sections thereof) belonging to one pair of tension threads do not diverge upon folding and\/or unfolding the implant. In particular embodiments according to the present invention, the tension threads which pass through one or more shaft opening(s) of a particular individual shaft fiber and which also pass together through a common aperture of the implant are guided in parallel or more or less in parallel (in at least one projection or in one plane) between shaft opening and aperture. Preferably, they are guided such that even upon folding or unfolding of the implant, the pair of tension threads do remain parallel or substantially parallel (or the angle between does not change or not substantially change). In certain embodiments according to the present invention, the implant's diameter is present in a plane perpendicular to a main flow direction of the implant, in case the implant is flown through by a fluid after its implantation. In some embodiments of the set according to the present invention, the at least one tension thread is a thread or filament or yarn, respectively. It can be designed or embodied similar to a surgical sutural thread or it can be such a surgical sutural thread. It can be designed or embodied as a rope or a cord or twine or string, respectively. It can be designed or embodied as a chain comprising a plurality of chain members engaged with adjacent chain members.

For example, in some embodiments according to the present invention, shaft fibers may have two or more shaft openings which are arranged under different distances between the respective opening and the tip or one end of the corresponding shaft fiber. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, at least one or all of the shaft fibers are arranged such that they do no move relatively to the apparatus in a longitudinal direction of the apparatus upon folding or unfolding the medical implant. In some embodiments according to the present invention, tension threads for folding and\/or unfolding the implant enter and\/or exit through the shaft opening. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, during the use of the apparatus, shaft fibers of the plurality of individual shaft fibers are always present in bundled form in at least one first section of the shaft section. In contrast, in a second section, they are provided for moving or drifting away from each other during use of the apparatus. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the second section is closer to the tip of the apparatus than the first section. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, the first section directly merges with or passes over into the second section. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the individual shaft fibers are arranged in contact to each other in the first section such that there is no lumen such as, e. g., a central lumen, for example a lumen usable during the use of the apparatus for fulfilling particular functions, provided between the shaft fibers in the first section. Spoken differently, the shaft fibers are arranged closely or at close quarters. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the term \u201cindividual shaft fibers\u201d\u2014when used discretely\u2014comprises all shaft fibers present of the plurality of the entirely present individual shaft fibers; in other embodiments, it only comprises some of them. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, the number of individual shaft fibers is set to two shaft fibers; in other embodiments, the number is set to three, four, five, six, seven etc. The number may be a great number; it may exceed ten or twenty and comprises every natural number up to at least 30 or 40. A great number of individual shaft fibers advantageously allows for folding and unfolding the implant (for example, the periphery of the implant) which experiences an action by means of the tension threads for folding\/unfolding, that exit from the individual shaft fibers into a great number of loops around the circumference of the implant. The inventors of the present invention have recognized that in certain embodiments, this favors a uniform folding or unfolding the implant. Additionally, a great number of shaft fibers may advantageously avoid any buckling or bulging or denting of the periphery. A great number can be any numerical value between 3 and 40, for example, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. Greater values are encompassed by the present invention as well. In some embodiments according to the present invention, neither the individual shaft fibers nor sections thereof are arranged within the interior or material of a wall of an envelope, an outer boundary or limitation, or the like of the apparatus. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, the individual shaft fibers are provided such that they cannot be shifted or moved relative to the remainder of the apparatus in a longitudinal direction thereof. In some embodiments according to the present invention, shaft fibers of the plurality of individual shaft fibers each comprise one or more shaft openings. The one or more tension threads can enter into and\/or exit from the respective shaft fiber through the shaft openings. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, such shaft openings are solely provided for allowing tension threads to enter in or into and\/or leave or exit from the respective individual shaft fiber. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the individual shaft fibers are designed or embodied to comprise one or more through-openings (extending into a longitudinal direction of the shaft fiber) or one or more hollow interiors. These through-openings or hollow interiors may allow guiding one or more tension threads through the shaft fiber, e. g. from the tensioning device of the apparatus to a shaft opening or to an exit opening at the tip portion of the shaft fiber. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the tension threads are arranged within an interior of the shaft fibers such that they can be shifted or moved relative to the respective shaft fibers. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the individual shaft fibers and\/or the tension threads do not comprise any devices for establishing a hook engagement with the implant. In some embodiments according to the present invention, some or all of the tension threads are connected with the implant by solely entangling or entwining the implant or a part or section or portion thereof. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, during a state of use of the apparatus, shaft fibers of the plurality of individual shaft fibers are arranged movably in or forth from (in the direction towards the tip of the apparatus) at least the second section of the shaft respectively independently of each other and\/or independently of the position of the implant relative to the apparatus for folding or unfolding. Differently spoken, they can move away from each other and\/or move towards each other in or within the second section. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the shaft comprises in at least one section thereof a device for bundling individual shaft fibers of the plurality of individual shaft fibers. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, there are provided more than just one device for bundling (but two, three, four, and so on, devices of this kind). Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the device for bundling comprises not just one means, e. g. having the shape of a collar, but more than one means (e. g., two, three, four, and so on, means). In certain of the embodiments comprising more than one device for bundling or means for bundling, the individual devices or means are provided on the shaft fibers while being spaced apart from each other. The particular space or distance chosen or set may advantageously contribute to setting or predetermining the stiffness, bendability and other mechanical features of the shaft fibers. This may be true for the shaft fibers' parts arranged between the devices or means for bundling. It may also be true for the parts of the shaft fibers that are not bundled but allowed to move freely with regard to each other. In some of the embodiments comprising more than one device for bundling or means for bundling, a (that is, one or more) core element or a (that is, one or more) interconnecting element is provided on, at or within the bundle of shaft fibers. The core element or interconnecting element may also advantageously contribute to setting or predetermining the stiffness, bendability and other mechanical features of the shaft fibers. The core element or interconnecting element may be attached to one, two or all of the devices or means for bundling. However, it may not be attached as well. The core element or interconnecting element may be provided to be extendable and to change its length, for example, when a distance between neighbouring, adjacent or interacting devices for bundling or means for bundling is changed or adapted to need. Both providing more than only one device for bundling or means for bundling and providing a core element or the like may in certain embodiments of the present invention allow for keeping the shaft fibers in parallel in use along a certain or even predetermined distance. Again, this may also advantageously contribute to setting or predetermining the stiffness, bendability and other mechanical features of the shaft fibers, both in the vicinity of core element or device or means for bundling and also in the second section of the shaft in which the shaft fibers are intended to move, wander or migrate freely in case of need. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, the device for bundling is designed or embodied as a ring encompassing the individual shaft fibers to be bundled and inhibiting the shaft fibers from drifting or moving away from each other. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the device for bundling is designed or embodied as a clamp, a protrusion or a constriction of the apparatus, or the like. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, the device for bundling individual shaft fibers is arranged to be shiftable along a longitudinal extension of the apparatus. Additionally or alternatively, the device for bundling may be alterable or manipulatable or engineerable in any other way. For example, the device for bundling may be manipulated by setting or altering a gap or play between shaft fibers and the device for bundling limiting or encircling the shaft fibers. Additionally or alternatively, the device for bundling can be provided for being used at or on different sections of the apparatus along the longitudinal extension thereof. The afore-mentioned manipulations may advantageously alter or adapt to the need, respectively, the stiffness or rigidity of the individual shaft fibers in or within the second section. In other embodiments, a device for bundling such as specified above is not provided. In some embodiments, it is not possible to distinguish a first section from a second section (such as specified above and below) or required. In some embodiments according to the present invention, individual shaft fibers are designed or embodied and provided or prepared for moving or bending or tilting, or the like, towards a rim portion of the implant when applying tension onto the implant by means of the tension thread extending through the said individual shaft fiber. \u201cMoving towards\u201d is in some embodiments to be understood as a deviation of at least one section of the individual shaft fiber (mainly in the second section or in a tip area of the individual shaft fiber) from a position that is arranged closer to a center of a cross section of the apparatus according to the present invention into a position that is arranged more radially as compared to the first position, e. g. into a rim area or towards a rim portion. In certain embodiments according to the present invention the bundle of shaft fibers can be (or are) arranged in a circular manner. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the shaft fibers (e. g. nine shaft fibers in total) are arranged in a circular manner in both the unfolded and\/or the folded state of the medical implant. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, a rim portion is a section of a circumference of the implant or a main part thereof, for example the exterior wall or envelope. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the rim portion comprises a part of the foldable material of the implant. The rim portion may be a curve-shaped part of an outer limitation or of a wall (e. g. a mesh, grid, strut or bar structure) of the implant. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, tension threads exiting from individual shaft fibers are connected with a rim portion of the implant for applying a force onto the implant. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the rim portion which is folded or unfolded by means of a particular shaft fiber or by means of the one or more tension threads of the shaft fiber, respectively, is the entire foldable and\/or unfoldable periphery of the implant. In those embodiments, the rim portion does not comprise the entire periphery, whereas, in other embodiments, it indeed does. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, tension threads exiting from individual shaft fibers are connected with a rim portion of the implant for applying a force onto the rim portion. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, tension threads exiting from at least two or more individual shaft fibers are connected with the said rim portion, or parts thereof. In some embodiments according to the present invention, tension threads exiting from individual shaft fibers are connected with a rim portion in an overlapping manner for applying a force onto the rim portion of the implant. In those embodiments, it is intended to fold or unfold a particular rim portion or a part thereof by means of two, three or more tension threads exiting from different individual shaft fibers. In this way, an overlap of several tension threads is achieved in an area of a particular rim portion. This may advantageously contribute to a more uniform folding of the implant. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, tension threads exiting from individual shaft fibers are connected with differently large, broad, long or in any other way different rim portions of the implant for applying a force on the said rim portions. Thus, a first rim portion may have a first arc or curve length x, a second rim portion may have a second arc or curve length 2x or x_2, x_2 being different from x. This may advantageously allow for or contribute to a more uniform folding of the implant even in cases in which the implant does not behave in a mechanically uniform way over its entire periphery upon folding. In some embodiments according to the invention, some or all of the tension threads, i. e. at least one tension thread, do not encompass the whole circumference of the implant. In certain embodiments according to the invention, one or more of the tension threads re-enter the lumen of the implant through apertures provided within the circumference or rim of the implant that are, for example, adjacent to the aperture through which the respective tension thread has exited from the lumen. In some embodiments according to the invention, some or all of the tension threads are provided to re-enter the lumen by an aperture provided in the rim that is different from the aperture through which the particular tension thread has exited from the lumen to an outside of the implant. In particular, any tension thread may re-enter the lumen by the next aperture, the next but one, next but two, next plus three, or the like, on the circumference or on the rim. Please note that in any embodiment according to the present invention the number of apertures may always be identical to the number of fibers. However, the number of apertures may as well differ from the number of fibers. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the apparatus is designed or intended for folding and\/or unfolding an implant designed as a stent or a heart valve arrangement. In some embodiments of the present invention, the implant is a stent or a heart valve arrangement. In certain embodiments of the present invention, individual shaft fibers on the one hand and the implant on the other hand are adapted, chosen or fit to each other as regards their mechanical properties. In certain embodiments according to the present invention, this may be effected such that, during the process of folding the implant, a first force or tension required for moving the shaft fibers in a section thereof, in particular in an area of a shaft opening for tension threads, from their longitudinal alignment or in a direction of the radial extension of the implant is lower than a second force or tension. The second force or tension is a force or tension required for effecting a folding or the beginning or an appreciable beginning of a folding of the implant by means of the tension threads connected with the implant that exit from the shaft openings. Said in a more simple manner, in some of those embodiments, upon application of tension, the individual shaft fiber firstly moves in a\u2014for example, radial\u2014direction towards a rim portion of the implant upon applying tension by means of the tension threads exiting from the shaft fiber, prior to beginning any folding of the respective rim portion. This adaptation or adjustment of properties of the individual shaft fibers (such as bendability, flexibility, elasticity, or rigidity) with respect to the properties of the implant may ensure that, upon applying tension by means of the tensioning device, the individual shaft fibers firstly automatically move into a position in which the force applied or to be applied by means of the tension thread is applied onto the implant or onto the rim portion in or under a desired angle. In some embodiments according to the present invention of, the implant is connected or intended to be interconnected with the apparatus by means of tension threads such that the tension threads (independently of each other or in an overlapping manner) interconnect with a great number of peripheral sections of the implant. A great number may be any numerical value between 3 and 40, for example, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. Greater values are encompassed by the present invention as well. In certain exemplary embodiments according to the present invention, at least one of the apparatus and the implant comprises exclusively, i.e. only, (one or more) materials that are MRI (short for: magnetic resonance imaging) compatible. In certain exemplary embodiments according to the present invention, at least one of the apparatus and the implant comprises exclusively (one or more) materials that are not magnetic, ferromagnetic, or both. In some exemplary embodiments according to the present invention, at least one of the apparatus and the implant does not comprise metal or any metal alloy. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the implant is connected or intended to be interconnected with the apparatus by means of tension threads such that the tension threads may act and\/or contact the medical implant not only at one end of the medical implant but at least at two or more sections of the medical implant which are longitudinally offset from each other. Some or all of the following advantages and the advantages mentioned above can be achieved in some, certain or all embodiments according to the present invention. In some embodiments according to the present invention, one advantage achievable according to the present invention is to advantageously reduce or even completely avoid buckling or bulging or denting of the implant resulting from applying a force onto the implant\u2014mainly onto the periphery thereof\u2014by means of the tension threads. Another advantage is a uniform folding of the implant even in a case in which an implant is designed inhomogeneously as regards the mechanical properties of the implant along the periphery thereof. According to yet another advantage\u2014due to the capacity of the individual shaft fibers to move, migrate or wander\u2014the tension threads' exit from exit openings of the shaft fibers may be effected in or under angles at which the tension threads will not suffer particular friction or shear stress at the exit or shaft openings. In connection therewith, a further advantage could be that the force for folding\u2014again due to the possibility of the individual shaft fibers to move, migrate or wander\u2014is acting on the implant under particularly advantageous angles. According to yet another advantage, the tension threads which pass through one or more shaft opening(s) of a particular individual shaft fiber and which also pass together through a common aperture of the implant are guided more or less in parallel between shaft opening and aperture. Further, even upon folding or unfolding of the implant, the pair of tension threads do remain parallel (or the angle between does not change or not substantially change). This way, in particular weaker stents or implants (weak being related to the force required for folding or crimping the implant) may be folded or crimped without buckling, even if only a small number of apertures is provided. Otherwise, upon folding or crimping, the implant may just buckle. With the present invention, single sections of the circumference or rim portions are compressed by forces applied onto the rim portions between the respective apertures. Hence, the force applied acts advantageously also in a circumferential direction. In the following, the present invention will be exemplarily described with respect to the appended drawing. In the drawing, same reference numerals refer to same or identical elements. In the drawing: FIG. 1a shows a partial longitudinal section through an apparatus of a set according to the present invention, a section of which is shown in a schematically simplified manner, prior to unfolding the implant; FIG. 1b shows a section along the line I-I of FIG. 1a; FIG. 2a shows a partial longitudinal section through the apparatus of a set according to the present invention of FIG. 1a, a section of which is shown in a schematically simplified manner, after unfolding the implant, with tension-free tension threads; FIG. 2b shows a section along the line II-II of FIG. 2a; FIG. 3a shows a partial longitudinal section through the apparatus of a set according to the present invention of FIG. 1a, a section of which is shown in a schematically simplified manner, after unfolding the implant with tensioned tension threads; FIG. 3b shows a section along the line III-III of FIG. 3a. FIG. 4a shows a partial longitudinal section through the apparatus of a set according to the present invention of FIG. 1a similar to FIG. 2b, a section of which is shown in a schematically simplified manner, after unfolding the implant, with tension-free tension threads; FIG. 4b shows part of what is seen in FIG. 4a; and FIG. 5a, 5b show an implant as used in particular embodiments of the set according to the present invention. FIG. 1 shows a partial longitudinal section through an apparatus 100 of a set according to the present invention that is shown in a schematically simplified manner and only in a section thereof. The apparatus 100 comprises a shaft 1 comprising a first section 3 and a second section 5. A plurality of individual shaft fibers 13 extends along or about both the first section 3 and the second section 5. The first and the second section 3, 5 may be referred to as shaft section. The individual shaft fibers 13 comprise shaft openings 9. Merely exemplarily, FIG. 1a shows two tension threads 11 and 11\u2032 each which exit from a shaft opening 9, twining or looping around a rim portion of the implant 300 shown in a folded state in FIG. 1a and\u2014to be understood merely exemplarily as well\u2014which re-enter into the same or into another shaft opening 9 of the same shaft fiber 13. One tension thread or more tension threads 11 and 11\u2032 may exit from an interior of the shaft 1 towards the exterior of the shaft 1 through the shaft openings 9 and\/or may enter in the opposite direction. In FIG. la, all threads 11 and 11\u2032 both exit and enter in a loop manner through the shaft openings 9. The tension threads 11 and 11\u2032 are provided or intended to encompass an implant not shown in FIG. 1a such that the implant will have an altered diameter when altering the tension applied onto the threads 11 and 11\u2032 in sections thereof. In the state of the implant 300 shown in FIG. 1a, the tension threads 11 and 11\u2032 are arranged at the implant 300 under tension by means of which they inhibit an undesired opening, unfolding or expansion of the implant 300 (the latter resulting, e. g., from a memory shape property of the implant). FIG. 1a shows only two tension threads 11 and 11\u2032. This serves for the purpose of clarity. However, a person skilled in the art will recognize that every shaft fiber 13 can comprise one or more of such tension threads. The latter can exit from the shaft fibers 13 at different heights thereof, wherein this applies both for one the same shaft fiber 13 and, e. g., adjacent shaft fibers 13. As can be seen from FIG. la, the individual shaft fibers 13 arranged on the right side (i. e. away from the tip of the apparatus 100 or within the second section 5, respectively) of a device 19 for bundling individual shaft fibers 13 are combined or concentrated in a bundle. In the second section 5 (i. e. on the left side of the device 19 or towards the tip of the apparatus 100, respectively), the shaft fibers 13 are arranged freely movably\u2014relative to each other, although, in the state of the implant 300 shown in FIG. 1a, they also contact each other\u2014as they do also in section 5. On the one hand, the device 19 for bundling allows for the bundled shaft fibers 13 in FIG. 1a to move freely in radial direction on the left side of the device 19. Thereby, they can follow the motion or movement or geometry of the unfolded implant 300. The device 19 is arranged not to hamper that movement. On the other hand, the device 19 for bundling allows for setting the rigidity or stiffness of the shaft fiber 13 on the left side of the device 19. By shifting the device 19 along the shaft 1 to the left as indicated by arrow A in FIG. 1a, the rigidity or stiffness of the individual shaft fibers 13 beyond the device 19 can be increased. By shifting the device 19 in the direction indicated by arrow B (i. e. to the right side in FIG. 1a), the rigidity or stiffness of the shaft fiber 13 on the left side of the device 19 can be reduced. In this way, the apparatus 100 may advantageously be adapted to different features or behaviour of different implants. It is obvious that the implant is represented in a very schematic and simplified manner. The present invention may be carried out with any implant designed or embodied to be foldable and\/or unfoldable by means of tension threads upon implantation. FIG. 1b shows a section along line I-I of FIG. 1a. FIG. 2a shows a partial longitudinal section through the apparatus 100 of FIG. 1a that is shown in a schematically simplified manner and only in a section thereof after having entirely unfolded the implant 300 with the tension threads 11 and 11\u2032 being completely or substantially released or free from tension. The individual shaft fibers 13 are present in a bundled form on both sides of the device 19 (i. e. on the left side and on the right side of the device 19, i. e. both in the first section 3 and in the second section 5). In any case they are provided in a bundle in which the individual shaft fibers 13 are close to each other or even contact each other. Due to their form which they take on while not experiencing any external tension or force, the shaft fibers 13 are present in an extended or stretched form in the second section 5. This is possible because the tension threads 11 and 11\u2032 are getting longer or stretch upon (or after) opening or unfolding of the implant 300. The latter can be achieved by correspondingly actuating the tensioning device not shown in the figures. FIG. 2b shows a section along the line II-II of FIG. 2a. As can be recognized, the four individual shaft fibers 13\u2032, 13\u2033, 13\u2032\u2033 and 13\u2033\u2033 are present in a bundle such as shown in FIG. 1b; however, they are only bundled loosely and are not pressed against each other by an external force. Tension threads 11\u2032, 11\u2033, 11\u2033\u2033 and 11\u2033\u2033 that are shown by way of example each encompass the whole circumference of the implant after having left the lumen 303 of the implant 300 through apertures a\u2032, a\u2033, a\u2032\u2033 and a\u2033\u2033 provided in the rim 305 thereof. In all sections of the circumference the tension threads 11\u2032, 11\u2033, 11\u2032\u2033 and the tension thread 11\u2033\u2033 are provided. In other embodiments than the one shown in FIG. 2b some or all of the tension threads 11\u2032, 11\u2033, 11\u2032\u2033 and 11\u2032\u2033 do not encompass the whole circumference of the implant. Rather, one or more of the tension threads may re-enter the lumen 303 of the implant 300 through apertures a\u2032, a\u0394, a\u2032\u2033 and a\u2033\u2033 (also referred to as penetration openings herein) provided within the circumference or rim 305 of the implant 300 that are, for example, adjacent to the aperture through which the respective tension thread has exited from the lumen 303. In fact, some or all of the tension threads 11\u2032, 11\u2033, 11\u2032\u2033 and 11\u2033\u2033 are provided to re-enter the lumen 303 by an aperture a\u2032, a\u2033, a\u2032\u2033 and a\u2033\u2033 provided in the rim 305 different from the aperture through which the particular tension thread has exited. In particular, any tension thread may re-enter the lumen 303 by the next aperture, the next but one, next but two, next plus three, or the like. For example, the tension thread 11\u2032 that exits from aperture a\u2032 may re-enter again through aperture a\u2033, a\u2032\u2033 or a\u2033\u2033. Generally said, any tension thread that exits from an aperture or penetration opening a\u2032 may re-enter through an aperture a\u2032+n, n comprising all natural numbers ranging from 1 (defining one of the two apertures directly neighboring aperture a\u2032) to m (m being the overall number of all apertures but one which are provided along the circumference). FIG. 3a shows a partial longitudinal section through the apparatus 100 of FIG. 1a that is shown in a schematically simplified manner and only in a section thereof after unfolding the implant 300 using tensioned tension threads. For example, the four shaft fibers 13\u2032, 13\u2033, 13\u2032\u2033 and 13\u2033\u2033 are present within the implant 300. As can be seen from FIG. 3b in which an additional cut shaft fiber 139 is shown, the number of four shaft fibers is merely chosen for improved clarity and more than four shaft fibers may be present. However, a person skilled in the art will recognize the latter when considering the above specification. FIG. 3b shows a section along the line III-III of FIG. 3a. It can readily be seen that, due to the tension applied by means of the respective tension threads 11\u2032, 11\u2033, 11\u2032\u2033 and 11\u2033\u2033, the shaft fibers 13\u2032, 13\u2033, 13\u2032\u2033 and 13\u2033\u2033 have moved from the center of the implant 300 towards a rim area of the implant 300 or at least in a radial direction. One effect of this motion or movement is explained in detail with respect to FIGS. 4 and 5 below. In FIG. 3a, only by way of example, a second device for bundling depicted as reference numeral 21 is shown. As can be seen from FIG. 3a, the shaft fibers' portions situated between the two devices 19 and 21 are kept in parallel by means of the devices 19 and 21. On the right side of device 21 for bundling, the shaft fibers can flex or bend again. FIG. 4a shows a partial longitudinal section through the apparatus of a set according to the present invention in a schematically simplified manner. Again, the tension threads are shown after unfolding the implant in a tension-free state. In contrast to the set shown in FIG. 2b, only three shaft fibers 13\u2032, 13\u2033 and 13\u2032\u2033 and only three apertures a\u2032, a\u2033 and a\u2032\u2033 are shown. Another difference between the set of FIG. 2b and the set of the FIG. 4b is that the tension threads exiting from a particular shaft fiber, e. g. shaft fiber 13\u2032, does not enter into the same shaft fiber 13\u2032 again. Rather, in the example of FIG. 4b, each fiber covers two thirds of the circumference 305 of the implant 300. That is, in the example of FIG. 4b, each pair of two tension threads extending parallel to each other between a particular shaft fiber and a common aperture of the implant's circumference do not belong to a common tension thread. A pair of two tension threads extending parallel to each other between a particular shaft fiber and a common aperture do not\u2014with respect to what is shown in FIG. 4a\u2014constitute start and end of one particular tension thread. In FIG. 4a, there are possible positions of the shaft fibers 13\u2032, 13\u2033 and 13\u2032\u2033 marked as dotted circles. Those circles are located closer to the circumference 305 the non-dotted positions in the center area of the implant 300. As can be derived from the dotted positions which related to a non tension-free state of the tensions threads, which state is not shown in FIG. 4a, even in the non tension-free state pairs of tension threads extending parallel to each other between a particular shaft fiber and a common aperture of the implant's circumference remain parallel to each other even during folding of the implant. The arrows shown in FIG. 4a are provided for easier reference only. FIG. 4b shows part of what is seen in FIG. 4a. In particular, it shows only two shaft fibers 13\u2032 and 13\u2033 connected by one tension thread. Also otherwise not necessarily derivable from FIG. 4b, the position of the shaft fibers 13\u2032 and 13\u2033 indicate that the tension thread shown in FIG. 4b is not in a tension-free state. Rather, it requires some tension acting on the tension tread and via the latter on the shaft fibers to move them from the center section of the implant 300 where the shaft fibers are only indicated in dotted lines towards the circumference 305 as shown in FIG. 4b. FIG. 5a shows an exemplary implant 300 as used in particular embodiments of the set according to the present invention in an unfolded state, FIG. 5b in a more folded condition. As can be seen from FIGS. 5a and 5b, the implant 300 has a first structural element embodied as proximal ring 307 and a second structural element embodied as distal ring 309 as described supra. The proximal ring 307 and the distal ring 309 are interconnected with each other by means of three (could be more or less) interconnecting elements which are embodied in the implant 300 of FIGS. 5a and 5b by way of example as posts or struts 312. As can further be seen from FIGS. 5a and 5b, the posts 312 each comprise (at least) two circular apertures a (which may have any other shape such as elliptic, oval, rectangular, and the like), through which strings or threads 11 are routed from an inner space of the implant 300 of the centre in which the tips of the individual shaft fibers (not shown in FIGS. 5a and 5b) are placed to an outside of the implant 300 for controlling the expansion and re-folding of the implant 300 as is explained in great detail in WO 2008\/029296 A2 (\u201cMinimally invasive heart valve replacement\u201d, filed on Feb. 15, 2007) to the inventors of the present invention. For further general details on the implant and the catheter it is referred to that document, the respective disclosure of which is herewith incorporated by way of reference. Posts 312 comprise a number of apertures 314, exemplarily arranged in two parallel rows extending in a longitudinal direction of the implant 300. As is explained in WO 2008\/029296 A2 in detail, the apertures 314 may be used for passing chords or ties through the posts 312 to secure lateral edges of leaflets or the like in place with the interior of the implant 300 to create a working valve, for example. It has to be noted that according to the present invention, one row of apertures 314 (of any shape and size thereof) is also contemplated. Having one row instead of two rows advantageously allows for designing posts having a smaller width. A smaller width of the post 312 allows in turn that the implant can be designed to be more open, even more flexible, that more space is left for the functionally effective part of the implant and the like. FIGS. 5a and 5b show how one particular embodiment of the implant according to the invention may look like seen from the side. It is, however, to be noted that due to the perspective chosen, FIGS. 5a, 5b do not show the particularities of the present invention. Those can be seen from, e. g. FIGS. 2b to 4b.","cpc_label":"A61F22439","ipc_label":"A61F224","filing_date":"20160102","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20160616","examiner_id":"98119.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention relates to a set according to claim 1 for folding or unfolding an implant., in the context of the novelty:  The present invention relates to set comprising apparatus (100) for folding or unfolding medical implant (300) by means of at least one tension thread (11, 11\u2032) The set comprises a shaft (1) and a tensioning device for altering a form or shape of the foldable and\/or unfoldable implant by using the tension thread ., what are the most relevant claims?

Some of these side effects and inconvenient dosing regimens can be controlled or reduced by the use of improved formulations and\/or improved delivery methods. Paclitaxel, for example, is highly effective in treating breast and lung cancers by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells by binding to microtubules. However, because the drug has a low aqueous solubility, paclitaxel is typically formulated using the toxic solvent Cremophor\u00ae EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil), which limits the amount of drug that can be administered to a patient. Patients taking the drug often require premedication with steroids or antihistamines for hypersensitivity reactions caused by the solvent. Abraxane\u00ae, a new paclitaxel formulation, does not employ a toxic solvent. When formulated with human serum albumin, the drug can be suspended in aqueous media. Thus, patients can better tolerate higher paclitaxel doses (up to 260 m g\/m 2 vs. 175 g\/m 2 ) and thereby achieve an improved response rate. Doxorubicin is another highly effective cancer drug belonging to a class of anthracycline compounds. However, the drug can cause severe cardiotoxicity and death. Patients taking a cumulative dose of 300 mg\/m 2 have a 1-2% chance of developing cardiomyopathy, with the incidence increasing with increasing dose (400 mg\/m 2 , 3-5%; 450 mg\/m 2 , 5 to 8%; 500 mg\/m 2 , 6-20%). The use of Doxil\u00ae, a pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, results in a reduced incidence of cardiotoxicity. Doxil\u00ae has a half-life in the blood of about 50 hours compared to about 10 minutes for doxorubicin. The slow-release of doxorubicin may explain the lower toxicity of the Doxil\u00ae formulation. Myocet\u00ae, a non-pegylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, also reduces the incidence of cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, its use also reduces the incidence of hand-foot syndrome associated with Doxil\u00ae. Myocet\u00ae is approved in Europe and is being evaluated in the United States. Mitoxantrone is used for the treatment of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. It is also indicated for reducing neurologic disability and\/or the frequency of clinical relapses in patients with secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Although one of the most effective drugs for treating MS, mitoxantrone is not recommended for long-term use. Patients who exceed a cumulative dose of 140 mg\/m 2 have an increased risk of acquiring irreversible cardiotoxicity and death. There is no liposomal formulation of this drug. Bleomycin, in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, is effective in treating squamous cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and testicular carcinoma. However, patients taking a cumulative dose of 400 units (\u02dc400 mg) risk developing pulmonary fibrosis. Mertansine, a derivative of maytansine, is an experimental cytotoxic agent. Because of its extreme toxicity, it is not used as a stand-alone therapeutic agent. To minimize side effects and to maximize efficacy, the compound is conjugated to tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies such as lorvotuzumab and trastuzumab. Vedotin, an auristatin, is another potent cytotoxic agent. To minimize side effects and to maximize efficacy, it is conjugated to tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody brentuximab. Recombinant interferon alfa-2a (Roferon\u00ae A) is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, hairy cell leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. The recommended dosing regimen for Roferon\u00ae A for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C is three times per week administered subcutaneously for 12 months. Pegasys\u00ae, a pegylated formulation of interferon alfa-2a, requires less frequent dosing. The recommended dosing regimen for Pegasys\u00ae for treating chronic hepatitis C is once weekly for 48 weeks by subcutaneous administration. Zalbin\u00ae, an interferon alfa-2b conjugated to human serum albumin, is an alternative to unconjugated interferon alfa-2b (Intron\u00ae A). Instead of subcutaneously or intramuscularly dosing the non-conjugated drug three times a week for up to 24 months, Zalbin\u00ae is administered only once every two weeks. Enfuvirtide, an FDA-approved HIV drug, is a fusion inhibitor having a linear 36-amino acid synthetic peptide. Due to its short half-life of four hours, treatment requires twice-daily subcutaneous injections. This inconvenient dosing schedule discourages its widespread use.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Thus, there is a need for improved drug formulations that can reduce or eliminate severe side effects and enhance the tolerability, efficacy, and\/or compliance of the drug. More specifically, many pharmacological compounds having amine groups can benefit from conjugation to other molecules or moieties provided that the crosslinking group is cleavable in vivo to release the drug. Thus, there is a need for new crosslinkers having a functional group that can form a cleavable bond with amine-containing molecules upon exposure to esterases and\/or under mild basic conditions (e.g., pH 7.4 to 9) in vivo. Cleavable cross-linkers, intermediates of cleavable cross-linkers, cleavable conjugates comprising the cleavable cross-linkers, and methods of synthesizing the cross-linkers, intermediates, and conjugates are disclosed.

Patients who exceed a cumulative dose of 140 mg\/m2 have an increased risk of acquiring irreversible cardiotoxicity and death. There is no liposomal formulation of this drug. Bleomycin, in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, is effective in treating squamous cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and testicular carcinoma. However, patients taking a cumulative dose of 400 units (\u02dc400 mg) risk developing pulmonary fibrosis. Mertansine, a derivative of maytansine, is an experimental cytotoxic agent. Because of its extreme toxicity, it is not used as a stand-alone therapeutic agent. To minimize side effects and to maximize efficacy, the compound is conjugated to tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies such as lorvotuzumab and trastuzumab. Vedotin, an auristatin, is another potent cytotoxic agent. To minimize side effects and to maximize efficacy, it is conjugated to tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody brentuximab. Recombinant interferon alfa-2a (Roferon\u00ae A) is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, hairy cell leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. The recommended dosing regimen for Roferon\u00ae A for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C is three times per week administered subcutaneously for 12 months. Pegasys\u00ae, a pegylated formulation of interferon alfa-2a, requires less frequent dosing. The recommended dosing regimen for Pegasys\u00ae for treating chronic hepatitis C is once weekly for 48 weeks by subcutaneous administration. Zalbin\u00ae, an interferon alfa-2b conjugated to human serum albumin, is an alternative to unconjugated interferon alfa-2b (Intron\u00ae A). Instead of subcutaneously or intramuscularly dosing the non-conjugated drug three times a week for up to 24 months, Zalbin\u00ae is administered only once every two weeks. Enfuvirtide, an FDA-approved HIV drug, is a fusion inhibitor having a linear 36-amino acid synthetic peptide. Due to its short half-life of four hours, treatment requires twice-daily subcutaneous injections. This inconvenient dosing schedule discourages its widespread use. SUMMARY Thus, there is a need for improved drug formulations that can reduce or eliminate severe side effects and enhance the tolerability, efficacy, and\/or compliance of the drug. More specifically, many pharmacological compounds having amine groups can benefit from conjugation to other molecules or moieties provided that the crosslinking group is cleavable in vivo to release the drug. Thus, there is a need for new crosslinkers having a functional group that can form a cleavable bond with amine-containing molecules upon exposure to esterases and\/or under mild basic conditions (e.g., pH 7.4 to 9) in vivo. Cleavable cross-linkers, intermediates of cleavable cross-linkers, cleavable conjugates comprising the cleavable cross-linkers, and methods of synthesizing the cross-linkers, intermediates, and conjugates are disclosed. Therapeutic conjugates provided by the present disclosure comprising the cleavable cross-linkers can reduce the side effects, enhance the efficacy, and\/or improve the convenience of treatment for the parent drug.

Example 9 In Vitro Cytotoxicity The effect of compounds provided by the present disclosure on cancer cell growth and viability is measured in a panel of human cancer cells grown in vitro. All cancer cell lines are obtained, for example, from the American Tissue Type Collection (ATTC). Cells are maintained in the following media: TUR, H69AR, Calu-6, ME180, and PC3 cells are grown in RPMI medium containing 4.5 g\/L glucose, 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate); and HT29 cells are grown in DMEM with 4.5 g\/L glucose, 10% FBS, and 6 mM\/L-glutamine. All cells are grown at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 and passaged bi-weekly. For cytoxicity studies, cells are seeded into 96-well clear-bottom microtiter plates at the following densities: TUR (7,500 cells\/well), HT29 (5,000 cells\/well), H69AR (10,000 cells\/well), Calu-6 (15,000 cells\/well), and ME180 (2,500 cells\/well). Cells are maintained at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO2 for 24 hours prior to addition of a test compound. Each condition is measured in triplicate. For compounds dissolved in DMSO, the final DMSO concentration in each well and in the non-drug treated control cells is constant and below 1% in all studies. The number of viable cells is determined after 24, 48, and 72 hours using Alamar blue fluorescence. Briefly, Alamar blue (10 mM) is added to each well for 4 hours, and the number of viable cells estimated by measuring the fluorescence of reduced Alamar blue (530 nm excitation, 590 nm emission). To correct for background fluorescence, cells are treated with 100% DMSO to eliminate all viable cells. The effect of a test compound on cell growth is determined by calculating the fraction of live cells treated with the test compound compared to untreated cells: (F1 drug treated\u2212F1 DMSO killed)\/(F1 untreated\u2212F1 DMSO killed). The half maximal growth inhibition value (GI50) is calculated using commercial curve-fitting software (e.g., Prism). Example 10 Efficacy in Xenograph Model Tumor xenograft studies are performed using nude athymic CD-1 mice (for example, from Charles River Laboratories). Human cancer cells (5\u00d7106 PC3, 5\u00d7106 HT29, 107 Calu-6, and 5\u00d7106 ME180) are implanted in the hind flank of nude mice. Tumor growth is measured using calipers and tumor volume calculated using the formula: (width 2\u00d7(length\/2)). Tumor volume is measured 3 days per week. Animal weight is measured 3 days per week to assess compound toxicity. Compounds are tested for in vivo tumor growth inhibition as follows. Animals bearing tumors (100-200 mg) are sorted into groups (5-8 animals) with similar average tumor mass per group. Drug doses are administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection (0.5 mL). Test compounds are dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with the concentration adjusted for animal weight. Actual drug concentrations in formulated doses are verified by quantitative nitrogen detection. Animals are dosed every 7 days for 21 days in most studies. In several studies, animals are dosed twice weekly (days 0, 4, 7, 10, 14, etc.). Tumor volume and animal weight are measured on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, and 28. At the end of the study, animal blood is removed for analysis of liver and kidney function (BUN, creatine, AST and ALT; analytical measurements performed by Quality Clinical Labs). Tumor volume at the end of the study is calculated as a percentage of the tumor volume on day 0. The percent tumor growth inhibition is obtained from the ratio of the percentage tumor volume increase in drug treated animals to the percentage tumor volume increase in saline treated animals. Finally, it should be noted that there are alternative ways of implementing the disclosures contained herein.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to treatment of many medical conditions which have no effective treatments or poor results with currently safety-proved, but not efficacy-proved compounds or biological agents. ABBREVIATIONS The term \u201cFDA\u201d refers to the Food and Drug Administration, a USA governmental agency which regulates food and drug in USA. The term \u201cNCE\u201d refers to New Chemical Entity which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other application submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The term \u201cPTD\u201d refers to Potential Therapeutic Drug, which is compound that passes the safety test, but fails the efficacy test. SPEAD refers to Safety Passed & Efficacy Approved Drug, which is a compound with approval by FDA to enter the market as a drug to treat medical conditions. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART Approval of drug products in the U.S. is governed by a rigorous review process conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A sponsor must demonstrate a compound or biological agent both safety and efficacy in well controlled clinical trials in the proper patient population for which it is indicated. Approval of drug products in the U.S. is governed by a rigorous review process conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Development of a new drug, especially a new chemical entity (NCE) is a very costly and time-consuming process; it takes roughly 12-15 years and 1.5 billion dollars on average. The high cost of the process makes the development of a new drug with multiple NCEs in same trial almost impossible. Theoretically there are diseases that can only be effectively treated with different NCEs together; however, the proper combination to treat diseases cannot be done due to high cost the trials make. Conceptually, according to drug treatment, diseases may be roughly divided into three types: 1. Diseases that can be Treated Effectively with a Single Drug Some diseases can be cured with a single drug. For example, Escherichia coli causes urinary tract infections, Staphylococcus aureus can cause lobar pneumonia, and both of them could be treated successfully with single antibiotics prior to the development of drug-resistant strains. 2. Diseases that can be Treated Effectively by Different Drugs Separately and more Effectively by a Combination of Different Drugs Different drugs may have a synergistic effect. Hypertension, diabetes, AIDS, asthma, and gastric ulcers belong to this category. There are eight categories of medications to treat hypertension; taking several drugs together can produce a stronger antihypertensive effect. Each medication in the cocktail recipes for AIDS treatment as well as gastric ulcers is an FDA-approved one on the market. 3. Diseases that can Only be Effectively Treated with Different New Compound Entities (NCEs) Together An NCE approval to enter the market as a drug is called a Safety Passed & Efficacy Approved Drug (SPEAD). We know many NCEs that passed the safety test, but did not show efficacy in clinical trials. This type of NCE might be essential or has the potential to play an important role in treatment of certain medical conditions only if they are included in treatment with other potential beneficial compounds in the trial, which could be called Potential Therapeutic Drug (PTD). PTDs cannot pass the current FDA approved process into the market. It is impossible to discern what disease falls into this category. We know that there are many severe, terminal conditions such as terminal-stage cancers, autoimmune diseases, and developmental disorders that currently have no effective treatments. Some of them might be well controlled or treated with two or more PTDs, or together with other drugs on the market, and they belong to the third type of diseases. In the phase II trials, overall success rates were 28% (2006-2007), and 18% (2008-2009). Out of one reported failure, 51% (44 out of 87) were due to insufficient efficacy (Arrowsmith 2011). For every successful phase II trial, there are two compounds that failed efficacy tests. There were 83 phase III trials and submission failures between 2007 and 2010; failure rate is around 50%. Among those that failed, 66% are due to efficacy (Arrowsmith 2011). The failed NCEs might be used as PTDs for clinical applications. Semagacestat, tramiprosate, tarenflurbil, and latrepirdine were high-profile, \u201cwould-be\u201d Alzheimer's drugs that failed the 3rd phase of clinical trials for efficacy reasons. Each made it through the safety stages (Rafii and Aisen 2009). They might be utilized in clinic as PTDs. Phylogenetic reconstruction of primary renal carcinomas and associated metastatic sites revealed that 63 to 69% of all somatic mutations not detectable across every tumor region. Intratumor heterogeneity was observed for a mutation within an autoinhibitory domain of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase (Gerlinger, Rowan et al. 2012). It is unrealistic to expect one NCE to have desired effects on cancers that have enormous heterogeneity. However, the diseases might be better treated with several NCEs with or without combination with other drugs on the market. Any compound in the clinical trial is selected from thousand and thousand compounds with specific target. NCEs in the trials usually have different targets. Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurological disorder that affects more than 37 million people worldwide. Synaptotoxic \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide, the plaques composed of aggregated A\u03b2, as well as the neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, are held to be essential to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). \u03b2-amyloid is a peptide with 39 to 43 amino acids. The isoforms with 40 and 42 amino acids (A\u03b240\/42) are the main constituents of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. \u03b2-amyloid is formed by proteolysis of APP. Therapeutic strategies include blocking A\u03b2 formation, slowing its aggregation into plaques, lowering its soluble levels in the brain, and disassembling pre-existing amyloid plaques. Semagacestat is a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor; which (along with \u03b2-secretase) is responsible for APP proteolysis (Fleisher, Raman et al. 2008). Tarenflurbil is a \u03b3-secretase modulator (Eriksen, Sagi et al. 2003); tramiprosate directly binds A\u03b2 to prevent A\u03b2 aggregation (Gervais 2004). Even they were tested to be safe, but failed to show lack of efficacy in phase III studies, they might significantly improve medical condition of AD in the combination. PTDs are compounds tested in trials in which safety is comparable with placebo or other SPEADs. Treating patients with them does not increase their risks compared with other drugs on the market. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There are a large number of PTDs and combinations of them are unlimited. PTDs are ineffective in the clinical trial separately, but may be effective when they are co-administered with other PTDs or approved drugs. Outcomes of their use might be one of four possibilities: 1) Combination is not secure and ineffective. The combination should not be used in clinical settings. 2) Combination is not safe, but effective. If so, the treating physician must weigh the risk to benefit ratio. If the combination causes only nausea, vomiting and limb weakness but prolongs life, physicians might continue it. If patients have arrhythmia with the application, that combination should be disbanded. 3) Combination is safe, but ineffective. That is to say, the combination has no effect on the condition, and it should not be used in the treatment. 4) Combination is safe and effective. This is the ideal outcome. By the FDA regulation, there is neither PTD in the market, nor data to tell us what combination or in what circumstances is effective. With the PTD application, clinicians will soon discern the proper conditions to use PTDs, as well as what combination should not be used for certain conditions. The clinical impacts of PTDs can be demonstrated in a few weeks or months, if not in a few days. The application might lead to remission of advanced cancer, improvement of autoimmune symptoms, neurologic recovery in stroke patients, and so on. The informed consent would be necessary prior to treatment and patients should know rationale of PTDs application, and proper monitoring system should be setup to check efficacy with combination among PTDs or PTD with SPEAD, beside severe side-effects, further clinical trial might be optional or necessary to verify the efficacy for the combination of PTDs after their usage. The targets of PTD treatment are serious medical conditions. The application of PTD might effectively control and improve the condition, or even save lives. Like with any SPEAD, there is always risk of interaction with other drugs; however, they could be detected with monitoring, controlled and eliminated in the practice. Benefits would heavily outweigh risks for patients that receive PTD. The same principle should also be applied to biological agents, such as vaccines against HIV infection, cancers, etc. The amendment to the current laws regarding FDA should be made which should allow clinical application of PTD in practice for certain severe or disabiliting medical conditions EMBODIMENT Embodiment 1 Compounds A, B, C, D underwent phase III clinical trials individually in treatment of Alzheimer's disease, they were all demonstrated safe, but did not show efficacy for improvement of patients' cognitive functions. These patients were prescribed these compounds with informed consent by different physicians, some of them take A and B, some A and C, some C and D. After 3 months many family members from the patients treated with C, D compounds reported that cognitive functions of their relatives in those medications significantly improved. Later on, a random clinical trial was done in which C and D combination verse a placebo were included in the study. The result showed cognitive functions in the two groups were significantly different, the patients treated with some C and D compounds were much better than ones in the placebo group (P<0.01) in their cognitive functions, whereas there were no significant differences of side-effects among these two groups. Embodiment 2 Compounds X, Y, Z underwent phase III clinical trials individually in treatment of prostate cancer, they were all demonstrated safe, but did not show effective to reduce the tumor size. These patients were prescribed these compounds with informed consent by different physicians, some of them take X plus medication alpha in the market (the first group), some take Y plus medication alpha (the 2nd group), and some take Z plus medication alpha (the 3rd group). Information were collected in central office. Data analysis shows tumor size in the 1st group patients shrinked tremendously, whereas tumor size in other two groups did not have significant change. A random clinical trial was done in which the first group are compared with these other two groups. The result showed that tumor in the first group was almost un-detectible, whereas the sizes in other groups placebo group had no apparent changes. Embodiment 3 Vaccines M, N underwent phase III clinical trials individually for prevention of HIV infection, they were all demonstrated safe, but did not show efficacy to reduce HIV infection. Vaccines M, N were given to all self-claimed homosexual men in area A, incidence of HIV infection was found to decrease 80% from the previous year among these patients compared with ones who did not receive these vaccines in the area. A random clinical trial was done in which the first group of patients receive vaccines M, N; the 2nd group of patient received only vaccines M, the 3rd on received placebo. Each group has 1,000 persons. After one year, it is found that nobody in the first group with HIV infection; 2.1% persons with HIV+ in the 2nd group, and 2.5% persons HIV+ in the placebo group.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to a shoe or other footwear with an automated closure mechanism which is activated without the use of the user's hands by activating the closure mechanism through an interaction between the user's foot and the sole of the shoe or footwear. The disclosed shoe and automatic closure mechanism operates through a series of motors which manipulate retractable leather, textile or other material making up said shoe.

Further, the disclosed shoe and automatic closure mechanism can particularly assist individuals with limited mobility by preventing injuries from occurring by utilizing hands-free operation of the automatic closure mechanism described herein. DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART There are a wide variety of standard attachment mechanisms for uses in different styles of shoes and other footwear. For example, laces, Velcro, leather straps, metal straps, hooks, and the like. Attempts have been made in the past to create automatic closure mechanisms for footwear with limited success, including automatic lace tightening systems and the like. However, none of the existing shoe closure mechanisms allow a user to effortlessly place their feet into the appropriate locations of the top of a sole of the shoe or footwear and automatically attach said footwear automatically without any involvement of the user's hands. There exists a need for an automatic shoe closure system that allows a user to both properly place their foot in a shoe and attach the shoe to the user's foot securely and then later remove the same shoe without the use of the user's hands. SUMMARY Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a shoe and automatic shoe closure mechanism which allows a user to both place a shoe about their foot and securely attach and later remove said shoe in a hands-free format.

Retraction button 502, shown in FIG. 1, may rests in a recessed pocket on one side of sole 200. Retraction button 502 may be placed anywhere around sole 200. The recessed pocket housing retraction button 502 may be sufficiently deep such that retraction button 502 will not be unintentionally depressed without deliberate intent on the part of the user. Retraction button 502 is sufficiently accessible, such that it can be activated by being depressed by the user's finger. However, retraction button 502 could also be operated in a hands-free format be deliberately pressing the user's shoe against a surface or object with a protrusion that is shaped and dimensioned to reach button 502 within its recessed pocket. The winding up of panels 201, 202 and 203 around motors 401, 402 and 403 to retract the panels into sole 200, may additionally operate to automatically disconnect panels 201, 202 and 203 from each other. Referring to FIG. 1, another method for removing shoe 100 by activating motors 401, 402 and 403 in the direction to wind up panels 201, 202 and 203 is through the use of a Smartphone software application which communicates with a wireless receiver positioned in sole 200. This embodiment facilitates hands-free removal of the shoe 100 by the user activating motors 401, 402 and 403 from a Smartphone handset, which wirelessly communicates with Shoe 100. Referring to FIG. 1, another method for removing shoe 100 by activating motors 401, 402 and 403 in the direction to wind up panels 201, 202 and 203 is through the use of a remote control. This embodiment facilitates hands-free removal of the shoe 100 by the user activating motors 401, 402 and 403 from the remote control, which wirelessly communicates with Shoe 100. The remote control may be sufficiently small that the user could carry it with them at all times in a pocket or about their person. The remote control may be mounted on a wall or near an entranceway to a home, or in another location where a user frequently puts on or removes footwear. Referring to FIG. 1, motors 401, 402 and 403 may each be powered by one or more batteries which is\/are contained within sole 200. Referring to FIG. 1, the battery or batteries used to power motors 401, 402 and 403 are charged by connecting a power supply through port 503. Referring to FIG. 2, one embodiment of an article of footwear is shown with a perspective view of shoe 100 showing a view of panels 201, 202 and 203 partially extracted from sole 200 and another view of panels 201, 202 and 203 connected to each other to create an exemplary embodiment of an assembled item of footwear. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention showing retraction and expansion slits for footwear panels and footwear panels in both partially and fully expanded positions; and a fully assembled shoe. Referring to FIG. 2, shoe 100 is additionally show with slits 201a, 202a and 203a visible in sole 200. Slits 201a, 202a and 203a may allow panels 201, 202 and 203 to fully retract inside sole 200 through the rotation of motors 401, 402 and 403. While slits 201a, 202a and 203a are shown in the sides of sole 200, similar slits may alternatively be placed on the top, outer edge of sole 200, such that panels 201, 202 and 203 would expand in an upward direction our of the sole 200. For example, the positioning of the slits 201a, 202a and 203a on the top of the sole 200 may prevent dirt, mud and other similar debris from entering the sole of the shoe. Alternatively, similarly slits could be placed at any desired angle with respect to sole 200 to guide panels 201, 202 and 203 in a desired direction upon expansion\/unwinding out of sole 200. Such alternative slits may be desirable based on the use of different fabric compositions for panels 201, 202 and 203. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, shoe 100 with panels 201, 202 and 203 fully retracted into sole 200, a shoe can be placed about a user's foot without the use of the user's hands by the user positioning their foot in the appropriate position with respect to sole 200 and stepping down onto expansion button 501. Upon pressing button 501, panels 201, 202 and 203 may fully expand from within sole 200 and automatically connect and associate with each other to snuggly fit around the user's foot. A user can then walk about in a normal fashion. When a user desires to remove shoe 100 in a hands-free format, the user can re-activate motors 401, 402 and 403 to disconnect panels 201, 202 and 203 from each other and retract panels 201, 202 and 203 back into sole 200. Re-activation of motors 401, 402 and 403 may be accomplished through the use of the Smartphone application or a remote control which wirelessly communicates with motors 401, 402 and 403. Alternatively, button 502 can be depressed in either a hands-free or manual format to similarly re-activate motors 401, 402 and 403.

Expression at the cell surface occurs from the pre-B stage of development until differentiation to a plasma cell. In human medicine, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapeutic (e.g., Rituximab) has been used to treat relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), as a first-line therapy for NHL as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and as an adjunct therapy for NHL. Although expression of CD20 has been shown to correlate with B-cell lymphoma in the dog (Jubala et al., Vet. Path., (2005) 42:468-76), the human therapeutic is not able to bind or deplete canine B-cells ex vivo (Impellizeri et al., Vet. J. (2006) 171:556-8). Therefore, compositions and methods of treatment of B-cell lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune disease, or other diseases that are characterized by the presence of too many B cells, overactive or over-expressed B cells or dysfunctional B cells are needed in the dog.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>One embodiment of the invention provides an isolated antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof that specifically binds canine CD20, wherein said antibody binds the same canine CD20 epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma cell line having ATCC number PTA-9433 (4F1), ATCC number PTA-9434 (6C8), ATCC number PTA-9435 (14A12), ATCC number PTA-9436 (18D3).

SEQUENCE LISTING This document incorporates by reference herein an electronic sequence listing text file, which is filed in electronic format via EFS-Web. The text file is named \u201c09-373_ST25.txt,\u201d is 19,220 bytes, and was created on Nov. 8, 2010. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION CD20 is a transmembrane protein that is expressed on more than 95% of B-lymphocytes. Expression at the cell surface occurs from the pre-B stage of development until differentiation to a plasma cell. In human medicine, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapeutic (e.g., Rituximab) has been used to treat relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), as a first-line therapy for NHL as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and as an adjunct therapy for NHL. Although expression of CD20 has been shown to correlate with B-cell lymphoma in the dog (Jubala et al., Vet. Path., (2005) 42:468-76), the human therapeutic is not able to bind or deplete canine B-cells ex vivo (Impellizeri et al., Vet. J. (2006) 171:556-8). Therefore, compositions and methods of treatment of B-cell lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune disease, or other diseases that are characterized by the presence of too many B cells, overactive or over-expressed B cells or dysfunctional B cells are needed in the dog. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One embodiment of the invention provides an isolated antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof that specifically binds canine CD20, wherein said antibody binds the same canine CD20 epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma cell line having ATCC number PTA-9433 (4F1), ATCC number PTA-9434 (6C8), ATCC number PTA-9435 (14A12), ATCC number PTA-9436 (18D3).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B shows the results of a canine CD20-peptide ELISA using antibodies produced by hybridomas 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, and 18D3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Polypeptides A polypeptide is a polymer of three or more amino acids covalently linked by amide bonds. A polypeptide can be post-translationally modified. A purified polypeptide is a polypeptide preparation that is substantially free of cellular material, other types of polypeptides, chemical precursors, chemicals used in synthesis of the polypeptide, or combinations thereof. A polypeptide preparation that is substantially free of cellular material, culture medium, chemical precursors, chemicals used in synthesis of the polypeptide has less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1% or more of other polypeptides, culture medium, chemical precursors, and\/or other chemicals used in synthesis. Therefore, a purified polypeptide is about 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more pure. A light or heavy chain variable region of an antibody has four framework regions interrupted by three hypervariable regions, known as complementary determining regions (CDRs). CDRs determine the specificity of antigen binding. The heavy chain and light chain each have three CDRs, designated from the N terminus as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 with the four framework regions flanking these CDRs. The amino acid sequences of the framework region are highly conserved and CDRs can be transplanted into other antibodies. Therefore, a recombinant antibody can be produced by combining CDRs from one or more antibodies with the framework of one or more other antibodies. Antibodies of the invention include antibodies that comprise at least one, two, three, four, five, or six (or combinations thereof) of the CDRs of any of the monoclonal antibodies isolated from the hybridomas shown in Table 1, or variant CDRs. Variant CDRs are CDRs comprising amino acid sequences similar to the amino acid sequences of CDRs of any of the monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridomas shown in Table 1. In one embodiment of the invention variant CDRs specifically bind to canine CD20 when present in an appropriate antibody structure (e.g., framework regions and other appropriate CDRs). Polypeptides of the invention comprise full-length canine anti-CD20 heavy chain variable regions, full length canine anti-CD20 light chain regions, fragments thereof, and combinations thereof.

In one embodiment of the invention an antibody comprises a VH of SEQ ID NOs:1-4 (or a variant thereof) and at least one, two or three VL CDRs of SEQ ID NOs:21-32 (or a variant thereof). In one embodiment of the invention an antibody comprises a VL of SEQ ID NOs:5-8 (or a variant thereof) and at least one, two or three VH CDRs of SEQ ID NOs:9-20 (or a variant thereof). An antibody of the invention can comprise the variable heavy chain CDRs from antibody 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, or 18D3. An antibody of the invention can comprise the variable light chain CDRs from antibody 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, or 18D3. An antibody of the invention can comprise a variable light chain that comprises the amino acid sequence of at least one or at least two or at least 3 CDRs of the 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, or 18D3 antibody variable light chains. An antibody of the invention can comprise a variable heavy chain that comprises the amino acid sequence of at least one or at least two or at least 3 CDRs of the 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, or 18D3 antibody variable heavy chains. Heavy chain CDRs can be combined with appropriate variable regions of an antibody light chain. Light chain CDRs preferably combined with heavy chain CDRs are, for example, CDRs comprising SEQ ID NOs:21-32, or CDRs functionally equivalent to these CDRs. The respective amino acid sequences correspond to CDR1 (SEQ ID NOs:21, 24, 27, and 30), CDR2 (SEQ ID NO:22, 25, 28, and 31), and CDR3 (SEQ ID NO:23, 26, 29, and 32) of an antibody light chain. Alternatively, these light chain CDRs may be used independently of the heavy chains described above. The CDRs are substituted for the corresponding CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, between the framework of a desired light chain variable region. Light chain CDRs can be combined with appropriate variable regions of an antibody heavy chain. Heavy chain CDRs preferably combined with light chain CDRs are, for example, CDRs comprising SEQ ID NOs:9-20, or CDRs functionally equivalent to these CDRs. The respective amino acid sequences correspond to CDR1 (SEQ ID NOs:9, 12, 15, and 18), CDR2 (SEQ ID NO:10, 13, 16, and 19), and CDR3 (SEQ ID NO:11, 14, 17, and 20) of an antibody light chain. Alternatively, these heavy chain CDRs may be used independently of the light chains described above. The CDRs are substituted for the corresponding CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 regions, between the framework of a desired heavy chain variable region. A polypeptide variant or variant CDR differs by about, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 or more amino acid residues (e.g., amino acid additions, substitutions or deletions) from a polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NOs:1-32 or a fragment thereof. Where this comparison requires alignment the sequences are aligned for maximum homology. The site of variation can occur anywhere in the polypeptide. In one embodiment of the invention a variant polypeptide has activity substantially similar to a polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NOs:1-32. Activity substantially similar means that when the polypeptide is used to construct an antibody, the antibody has the same or substantially the same activity as an antibody shown in Table 1. Methods of introducing a mutation into an amino acid sequence are well known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Ausubel (ed.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. (1994); Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)). Mutations can also be introduced using commercially available kits such as \u201cQuikChange\u2122 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit\u201d (Stratagene). The generation of a functionally active variant polypeptide by replacing an amino acid that does not influence the function of a polypeptide can be accomplished by one skilled in the art. The variant polypeptides can have conservative amino acid substitutions at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A conservative substitution is one in which an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid that has similar properties, such that one skilled in the art of peptide chemistry would expect the secondary structure and hydropathic nature of the polypeptide to be substantially unchanged. In general, the following groups of amino acids represent conservative changes: (1) ala, pro, gly, glu, asp, gln, asn, ser, thr; (2) cys, ser, tyr, thr; (3) val, ile, leu, met, ala, phe; (4) lys, arg, his; and (5) phe, tyr, trp, his. A variant polypeptide can also be isolated using a hybridization technique. Briefly, DNA having a high homology to the whole or part of a nucleic acid sequence encoding SEQ ID NOs:1-36 is used to prepare a polypeptide. Therefore, a polypeptide of the invention also includes polypeptides that are variants of SEQ ID NOs:1-36 polypeptides and are encoded by a nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes with a nucleic acid encoding SEQ ID NOs:1-36 or a complement thereof. One of skill in the art can easily determine nucleic acid sequences that encode polypeptides of the invention using readily available codon tables. As such, these nucleic acid sequences are not presented herein. As used herein, percent identity of two amino acid sequences (or of two nucleic acid sequences) is determined using the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (PNAS USA 87:2264-2268, 1990), modified as in Karlin and Altschul, PNAS USA 90:5873-5877, 1993). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, 1990). BLAST nucleotide searches are performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12. BLAST protein searches are performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3. To obtain gapped alignment for comparison purposes GappedBLAST is utilized as described in Altschul et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, 1997). When utilizing BLAST and GappedBLAST programs the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) are used to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecule of the invention. Identity or identical means amino acid sequence (or nucleic acid sequence) similarity and has an art recognized meaning. Sequences with identity share identical or similar amino acids (or nucleic acids). Sequence identity is the percentage of amino acids identical to those in the antibody's original amino acid sequence, determined after the sequences are aligned and gaps are appropriately introduced to maximize the sequence identity as necessary. Thus, a candidate sequence sharing 85% amino acid sequence identity with a reference sequence requires that, following alignment of the candidate sequence with the reference sequence, 85% of the amino acids in the candidate sequence are identical to the corresponding amino acids in the reference sequence, and\/or constitute conservative amino acid changes. Antibodies of the invention can comprise CDRs of 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, or 18D3 antibodies or variant antibodies comprising one or more variant CDRs. These variant antibodies can have an activity equivalent (e.g., binding to canine CD20 with the same or substantially similar Kd as an antibody produced by a hybridoma of Table 1) to that of 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, or 18D3. Antibody variants retain substantially the same functional activity of 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, or 18D3 antibodies. Naturally occurring functionally active variant antibodies such as allelic variants and species variants and non-naturally occurring functionally active variants are included in the invention and can be produced by, for example, mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis. Antibody variants are encoded by variant polypeptides and variant CDRs of SEQ ID NOs:1-32. The invention also includes polypeptide variants or CDR variants of SEQ ID NOs:1-32. Polypeptide variants or CDR variant of SEQ ID NOs:1-36 can comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions. In one embodiment, a variant polypeptide or variant CDR includes an amino acid sequence at least about 75% identical to a sequence shown as SEQ ID NOs:1-36. Preferably, the variant polypeptide or CDR is at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NOs:1-36. Variant polypeptides or variant CDRs encode a variant antibody, which is an antibody comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs:1-32 in which one or more amino acid residues have been added, substituted or deleted. For example, the variable region of an antibody can be modified to improve its biological properties, such as antigen binding. Such modifications can be achieved by e.g., site-directed mutagenesis, PCR-based mutagenesis, cassette mutagenesis. Variant antibodies comprise an amino acid sequence which is at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of a heavy or light chain variable region of 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, 18D3. In one embodiment of the invention, a variant antibody retains the same function of a 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, 18D3 antibody (e.g., binds canine CD20 (in particular an extracellular region of canine CD20) at the same or substantially similar Kd as an antibody produced by the hybridomas shown in Table 1, e.g. within about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, or 20% of the Kd of an antibody produced by the hybridomas shown in Table 1). In another embodiment of the invention, a variant antibody may have a function that is somewhat altered from a 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, 18D3 antibody (e.g., binding canine CD20 with a Kd that is higher or lower than an 6C8, 4F1, 14A12, 18D3 antibody). Polypeptide sequences can be modified, for example, by synthesizing multiple polynucleotides encoding the amino acid sequence of a variant variable region, and preparing nucleic acids encoding the variable region by PCR using the polynucleotides. Antibodies that comprise one or more CDRs can be prepared by inserting the polynucleotide into an appropriate expression vector and expressing the polynucleotide. For example, the polynucleotides are synthesized using mixed nucleotides to prepare a DNA library that encodes a variety of antibodies comprising CDRs with various amino acids introduced at certain positions. An antibody can be isolated by selecting from the library a clone encoding an antibody that binds to canine CD20 with a Kd that is the same or substantially similar to the Kd of an antibody produced by a hybridoma shown in Table 1. A polypeptide of the invention can be covalently or non-covalently linked to an amino acid sequence to which the polypeptide is not normally associated with in nature. Additionally, a polypeptide of the invention can be covalently or non-covalently linked to compounds or molecules other than amino acids. For example, a polypeptide can be linked to an indicator reagent, an amino acid spacer, an amino acid linker, a signal sequence, a stop transfer sequence, a transmembrane domain, a protein purification ligand, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment of the invention a protein purification ligand can be one or more C amino acid residues at, for example, the amino terminus or carboxy terminus of a polypeptide of the invention. An amino acid spacer is a sequence of amino acids that are not usually associated with a polypeptide of the invention in nature. An amino acid spacer can comprise about 1, 5, 10, 20, 100, or 1,000 amino acids. If desired, a polypeptide can be a fusion protein, which can also contain other amino acid sequences, such as amino acid linkers, amino acid spacers, signal sequences, TMR stop transfer sequences, transmembrane domains, as well as ligands useful in protein purification, such as glutathione-S-transferase, histidine tag, and staphylococcal protein A, or combinations thereof. A fusion protein is two or more different amino acid sequences operably linked to each other. A fusion protein construct can be synthesized chemically using organic compound synthesis techniques by joining individual polypeptide fragments together in fixed sequence. A fusion protein construct can also be expressed by a genetically modified host cell (such as E. coli) cultured in vitro, which carries an introduced expression vector bearing specified recombinant DNA sequences encoding the amino acids residues in proper sequence. The heterologous polypeptide can be fused, for example, to the N-terminus or C-terminus of a polypeptide of the invention. A polypeptide of the invention can also comprise homologous amino acid sequences, i.e., other CD20 or CD20-derived sequences. More than one polypeptide of the invention can be present in a fusion protein. Fragments of polypeptides of the invention can be present in a fusion protein of the invention. A fusion protein of the invention can comprise, e.g., one or more of SEQ ID NOs:1-36, fragments thereof, or combinations thereof. Polypeptides of the invention can be in a multimeric form. That is, a polypeptide can comprise one or more copies of SEQ ID NOs:1-36 or a combination thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, a polypeptide of the invention is derived from a canine. A polypeptide of the invention can be isolated from cells or tissue sources using standard protein purification techniques. Polypeptides of the invention can also be synthesized chemically or produced by recombinant DNA techniques. For example, a polypeptide of the invention can be synthesized using conventional peptide synthesizers. A polypeptide of the invention can be produced recombinantly. A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention can be introduced into a recombinant expression vector, which can be expressed in a suitable expression host cell system using techniques well known in the art. A variety of bacterial, yeast, plant, mammalian, and insect expression systems are available in the art and any such expression system can be used. Optionally, a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide can be translated in a cell-free translation system. Antibodies Antibodies refer to an intact antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that competes with the intact antibody for antigen binding. Antigen-binding fragments can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Antigen-binding fragments include an antigen-binding domain or a variable region and include, e.g., Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2, Fab\u2032-SH, Fab-like antibodies (an antigen-binding fragment containing variable regions of a heavy chain and light chain that is equivalent to Fab fragments that are obtained by papain digestion), F(ab\u2032)2-like antibodies (an antigen-binding fragment containing two antigen-binding domains that is equivalent to F(ab\u2032)2 fragments that are obtained by pepsin digestion), Fv, linear antibodies, multispecific antibodies prepared from antibody fragments, and single-chain antibodies (scFv). An antibody can be a monoclonal antibody, polyclonal antibody, diabody, bispecific antibody, multifunctional antibody, chimeric antibody, caninized antibody, canine antibody, humanized antibody, human antibody, synthetic antibody, or CDR-grafted antibody. An antibody of the invention can be any isotype including IgG (IgG1, IgG2, IgG2a, Ig2b, IgG3, IgG4), IgM, IgA (IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, and IgE. An epitope is any protein determinant that specifically binds to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopes can comprise chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and can have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An antibody of the invention binds to an epitope that overlaps with or is the same (i.e., a substantially identical epitope) as any of the monoclonal antibodies shown in Table 1. An antibody that binds to an epitope substantially identical to an epitope of canine CD20 to which a monoclonal antibody of Table 1 binds, can be obtained by analyzing epitopes of the monoclonal antibodies of Table 1 using well known epitope mapping methods. Competitive assays can be used to determine if two antibodies bind to a substantially identical epitope of a canine CD20. Where the binding of a first anti-canine CD20 antibody with canine CD20 is competitively inhibited by a second anti-canine CD20 antibody, the first antibody and the second antibody can be considered to bind to a substantially identical epitope on canine CD20. Competitively inhibits means that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof can specifically bind an epitope that a monoclonal antibody produced by a hybridoma cell line shown in Table 1 is directed to, using conventional reciprocal antibody competition assays. See e.g., Belanger et al. (1973), Clinica Chimica Acta 48:15. Therefore, the invention comprises antibodies that bind to an epitope that is substantially identical to or the same as an epitope of canine CD20 to which an antibody produced by a hybridoma of Table 1 binds, and that can also comprise the activity of inducing apoptosis of CD20+ cells and\/or binding to canine lymphocytes. Antibodies that competitively inhibit binding of one or more of 4F1, 6C8, 14A12, 18D3 or antigen binding fragments thereof, reduce the binding of one or more of 4F1, 6C8, 14A12, 18D3 or antigen binding fragments thereof to a canine CD20 polypeptide, CD20+ cells, and\/or canine lymphocytes by about 30%, 50%, 75%, 90% or 100% in a competitive inhibition assay. In one embodiment of the invention, an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof specifically binds the extracellular domain 2 of a canine polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:33. In another embodiment of the invention, an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof specifically binds a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:35 or SEQ ID NO:36. In yet another embodiment of the invention, an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof specifically binds a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:33 and SEQ ID NO:35. In an additional embodiment of the invention, an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof specifically binds a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:33 and SEQ ID NO:36. Antibodies of the invention, fragments thereof, or variants thereof can specifically bind canine CD20 with a wide range of disassociation constants (Kd). For example, an antibody can bind canine CD20 with a Kd equal to or less than about 10\u22127 M, such as but not limited to, 0.1-9.9 10\u22125, 10\u22126, 10\u22127, 10\u22128, 10\u22129, 10\u221210, 10\u221211, 10\u221212, 10\u221213, 10\u221214, 10\u221215 or any range or value therein, as determined by e.g, surface plasmon resonance or the Kinexa method. The invention encompasses antibodies that bind canine CD20 polypeptides with a disassociation constant or Kd that is within any one of the ranges that are between each of the individual recited values. An antibody has the same or substantially identical activity as antibodies produced by the hybridomas shown in Table 1 when the Kd for binding to canine CD20 (in particular an extracellular portion of canine CD20) is within about 0.1., 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, or 20% (or any range or particular value between 0.1 and 20%) of the Kd for binding to canine CD20 (in particular an extracellular portion of canine CD20) of an antibody produced by the hybridomas shown in Table 1. Antibodies of the invention, fragments thereof or variants thereof can bind canine CD20 polypeptides with an off rate (Koff) of less than or equal to 01.-9.9\u00d710\u22123 sec\u22121, 10\u22124 sec\u22121, 10\u22125 sec\u22121, 10\u22126 sec\u22121, 10\u22127 sec\u22121. The invention encompasses antibodies that bind canine CD20 polypeptides with an off rate that is within any one of the ranges that are between each of the individual recited values. An antibody has the same or substantially identical activity as antibodies produced by the hybridomas shown in Table 1 when the Koff for binding to canine CD20 (in particular an extracellular portion of canine CD20) is within about 0.1., 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, or 20% (or any range or particular value between 0.1 and 20%) of the Koff for binding to canine CD20 (in particular an extracellular portion of canine CD20) of an antibody produced by the hybridomas shown in Table 1. Antibodies of the invention, fragments thereof, or variants thereof can bind canine CD20 polypeptides, CD20+ cells, and\/or canine lymphocytes with an on rate (Kon) greater than or equal to 0.1-9.9\u00d7103 M\u22121 sec\u22121, 104 M\u22121 sec\u22121, 105 M\u22121 sec\u22121, 106 M\u22121 sec\u22121, 107 M\u22121 sec\u22121, 108 M\u22121 sec\u22121. The invention encompasses antibodies that bind canine CD20 polypeptides with on rate that is within any one of the ranges that are between each of the individual recited values. An antibody has the same or substantially identical activity as antibodies produced by the hybridomas shown in Table 1 when the Kon for binding to canine CD20 (in particular an extracellular portion of canine CD20) is within about 0.1., 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, or 20% (or any range or particular value between 0.1 and 20%) of the Kon for binding to canine CD20 (in particular an extracellular portion of canine CD20) of an antibody produced by the hybridomas shown in Table 1. Antibodies of the invention specifically bind canine CD20. In this context \u201cspecifically binds\u201d means that the antibody recognizes and binds to canine CD20 with greater affinity than to other, non-specific molecules that are not canine CD20. For example, an antibody raised against an antigen (polypeptide) to which it binds more efficiently than to a non-specific antigen (e.g., a canine protein that is not related to or homologous to CD20) can be described as specifically binding to the antigen. Binding specificity can be tested using, for example, an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), a radioimmunoassay (RIA), or a western blot assay using methodology well known in the art. The invention also encompasses antibodies, fragments thereof, or variants thereof that have one or more of the same or substantially similar biological characteristics as the antibodies shown in Table 1. Biological characteristics are the in vitro or in vivo activities or properties of the antibodies shown in Table 1, including, for example, the ability to bind to canine CD20 (in particular, extracellular region 2) with a substantially similar Kd, Koff, and\/or Kon rate and\/or cause apoptosis of CD20+ cells and\/or bind canine lymphocytes. Antibodies of the invention can be produced using methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, a canine CD20 antigen or a fragment thereof can be used to immunize animals. The CD20 or fragment thereof can be conjugated to a carrier protein and\/or administered to the animals with an adjuvant. A canine CD20 antigen can comprise one or more epitopes (i.e., antigenic determinants). An epitope can be a linear epitope, sequential epitope or a conformational epitope. Epitopes within a polypeptide of the invention can be identified by several methods. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101; Jameson & Wolf, CABIOS 4:181-186 (1988). For example, canine CD20 can be isolated and screened. A series of short peptides, which together span the entire CD20 polypeptide sequence, can be prepared by proteolytic cleavage. By starting with, for example, 100-mer polypeptide fragments, each fragment can be tested for the presence of epitopes recognized in an ELISA. For example, in an ELISA assay a canine CD20 antigen, such as a 100-mer polypeptide fragment, is attached to a solid support, such as the wells of a plastic multi-well plate. A population of antibodies are labeled, added to the solid support and allowed to bind to the unlabeled antigen, under conditions where non-specific absorption is blocked, and any unbound antibody and other proteins are washed away. Antibody binding is detected by, for example, a reaction that converts a colorless substrate into a colored reaction product. Progressively smaller and overlapping fragments can then be tested from an identified 100-mer to map the epitope of interest. A monoclonal antibody is an antibody obtained from a group of substantially homogeneous antibodies. A group of substantially homogeneous antibodies can contain a small amount of naturally occurring mutants. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific and interact with a single antigenic site. Each monoclonal antibody typically targets a single epitope while polyclonal antibody populations typically contain various antibodies that target a group of diverse epitopes. Monoclonal antibodies can be produced by many methods including, for example, hybridoma methods (Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:495, 1975), recombination methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), isolation from phage antibody libraries (Clackson et al., Nature 352:624-628, 1991; Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597, 1991). Methods for preparing monoclonal antibodies from hybridomas are well known to those of skill in the art and include, e.g., standard cell culture methods and ascites production methods. Recombinant antibodies produced by gene engineering can be made using the polynucleotide sequences of the invention. Genes encoding antibodies or fragments thereof can be isolated from hybridomas of the invention or other hybridomas. The genes can be inserted into an appropriate vector and introduced into a host cell. See, e.g., Borrebaeck & Larrick, Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies, Macmillan Publ. Ltd, 1990. Whole antibodies can also be made using PCR primers having VH or VL nucleotide sequences, a restriction site, and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site to amplify the VH or VL sequences in scFv clones. Using well known cloning techniques, the PCR amplified VH domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a VH constant region, e.g., a canine constant region, and the PCR amplified VL domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a VL constant region, e.g., canine kappa or lambda constant regions. The vectors for expressing the VH or VL domains can comprise, e.g., a promoter suitable to direct expression of the heavy and light chains in the chosen expression system, a secretion signal, a cloning site for the immunoglobulin variable domain, immunoglobulin constant domains, and a selection marker. The VH and VL domains can also be cloned into one vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co-transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full-length antibodies, e.g., IgG, using techniques known to those of skill in the art. Chimeric antibodies have a part of a heavy chain and\/or light chain that is derived from a specific species or a specific antibody class or subclass, and the remaining portion of the chain is derived from another species, or another antibody class or subclass. See e.g., Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., J. Immunol. Methods 125:191-202 (1989); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397. Chimeric antibodies can be produced using a variety of techniques including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, Molecular Immunology 28:489-498 (1991); Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska et al., PNAS 96:969-973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332). In one embodiment, a chimeric antibody can comprise variable and constant regions of species that are different from each other, for example, an antibody can comprise the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of a non-human mammal such as a mouse, and the heavy chain and light chain constant regions of a canine. Such an antibody can be obtained by ligating a polynucleotide encoding a variable region of a mouse antibody to a polynucleotide encoding a constant region of a canine antibody; incorporating the ligated polynucleotides into an expression vector; and introducing the vector into a host cell for production of the antibody. See WO 96\/02576. The host cells can be eukaryotic cells, such as mammalian cells, including, e.g., CHO cells, lymphocytes, and myeloma cells. The chimeric antibody can comprise additional amino acid acids that are not included in the CDRs introduced into the recipient antibody, nor in the framework sequences. These amino acids can be introduced to more accurately optimize the antibody's ability to recognize and bind to an antigen. For example, as necessary, amino acids in the framework region of an antibody variable region can be substituted such that the CDR of a reshaped canine antibody forms an appropriate antigen-binding site. See Sato et al., Cancer Res. (1993) 53:851-856. The nucleic acid sequences for four different canine Ig gamma constant regions have been cloned and sequenced. See Tang et al., Vet. Immunol. Immunopath. (2001) 80:259. The sequences for canine lambda and kappa chain constant regions, along with gamma constant regains have been reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,861. Human antibodies can be made by sensitizing human lymphocytes with antigens of interest or cells expressing antigens of interest in vitro; and fusing the sensitized lymphocytes with human myeloma cells. Alternatively, a human antibody can be made by using an antigen to immunize a transgenic animal that comprises a partial or entire repertoire of human antibody genes. See Green et al., Nature Genetics 7:13-21 (1994); Mandez et al., Nature Genetics 15:146-156 (1997); Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856-859 (1994); WO 93\/12227; WO 92\/03918; WO 94\/02602, WO 94\/25585, WO 96\/34096, and WO 96\/33735). Human antibodies can also be made by panning with a human antibody library. For example, the variable region of a human antibody is expressed as a single chain antibody (scFv) on the surface of a phage, using phage display method, and phages that bind to the antigen are selected. By analyzing the polynucleotides of selected phages, the polynucleotides encoding the variable regions of human antibodies that bind to the antigen can be determined. If the polynucleotide sequences of scFvs that bind to the antigen are identified, appropriate expression vectors comprising these sequences can be constructed, and then introduced into appropriate hosts and expressed to obtain human antibodies. See WO 92\/01047, WO 92\/20791, WO 93\/06213, WO 93\/11236, WO 93\/19172, WO 95\/01438, and WO 95\/15388. These same human antibody production methods can be used to make canine antibodies. Antibodies of the invention can be used to generate anti-idiotype antibodies that \u201cmimic\u201d canine CD20 polypeptides using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. See, Greenspan & Bona, FASEB 17:437-444 (1993); Nissinoff, J. Immunol. 147:2429-2438 (1991). Antibodies can be purified by any method, including, e.g., protein A-Sepharose methods, hydroxyapatite chromatography, salting-out methods with sulfate, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, filtration, unitrafiltration, dialysis, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectrofocusing or combinations thereof. Antibodies of the invention can be covalently attached to other molecules such that covalent attachment does not affect the ability of the antibody to bind to canine CD20. For example, antibodies can be modified by, e.g., glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Additionally, an antibody can contain one or more non-standard amino acids. One embodiment of the invention provides mixtures of antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, or variants thereof that bind to canine CD20, wherein the mixture has at least two, three, four, five or more different antibodies of the invention. The invention also provides for panels of antibodies that have different affinities for canine CD20, different specificities for canine CD20, or different dissociation rates. The invention provides panels of at least about 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, or 1,000 antibodies. Polynucleotides Polynucleotides of the invention contain less than an entire canine genome and can be single- or double-stranded nucleic acids. A polynucleotide can be RNA, DNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, chemically synthesized RNA or DNA or combinations thereof. The polynucleotides can be purified free of other components, such as proteins, lipids and other polynucleotides. For example, the polynucleotide can be 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% pure by dry weight. Purity can be measured by a method such as column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or HPLC analysis. The polynucleotides of the invention encode the polypeptides described above. In one embodiment of the invention the polynucleotides encode polypeptides shown in, e.g., SEQ ID NOs:1-36 or portions or combinations thereof. The polynucleotides of the invention encode the polypeptides of the invention described above, as well as fragments thereof. A polynucleotide fragment can be about 9, 18, 21, 27, 30, 33, 39, 48, 51, 75, 100, 120, 130, 140, 150 or more polynucleotides. One of skill in the art can obtain the polynucleotide sequences of the invention using the disclosed polypeptide sequences and codon tables. Polynucleotides can contain naturally occurring polynucleotides or sequences that differ from those of any naturally occurring sequences or polynucleotides. Polynucleotides of the invention can differ from naturally occurring nucleic acids, but still encode naturally occurring amino acids due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Polynucleotides of the invention can also comprise other heterologous nucleotide sequences, such as sequences coding for linkers, signal sequences, amino acid spacers, heterologous signal sequences, TMR stop transfer sequences, transmembrane domains, or ligands useful in protein purification such as glutathione-S-transferase, histidine tag, and staphylococcal protein A. Polynucleotides of the invention can also comprise other nucleotide sequences, e.g., other CD20 or CD20-derived sequences. Methods for introducing polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., vectors comprising the polynucleotides or naked polynucleotides) into cells, either transiently or stably, are well known in the art. For example, transformation methods using standard CaCl2, MgCl2, or RbCl methods, protoplast fusion methods or transfection of naked or encapsulated nucleic acids using calcium phosphate precipitation, microinjection, viral infection, and electroporation. In one embodiment of the invention, a polynucleotide of the invention is derived from a mammal, such as a dog. Polynucleotides can also be synthesized in the laboratory, for example, using an automatic synthesizer. An amplification method such as PCR can be used to amplify polynucleotides from either genomic DNA or cDNA encoding the polypeptides. Polynucleotide molecules encoding a variant polypeptide can also be isolated by a gene amplification method such as PCR using a portion of a nucleic acid molecule DNA encoding a polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NOs:1-36 as the probe. Polynucleotides and fragments thereof of the invention can be used, for example, as probes or primers to detect the presence of canine CD20 polynucleotides in a sample, such as a biological sample. A biological sample can be, e.g., lymph node or tissue aspirate, serum, lymphocytes, whole blood, cellular suspension, or fluid effusion. The ability of such probes to specifically hybridize to polynucleotide sequences will enable them to be of use in detecting the presence of complementary sequences in a given sample. Polynucleotide probes of the invention can hybridize to complementary sequences in a sample such as a biological sample, for example, lymph tissue. Polynucleotides from the sample can be, for example, subjected to gel electrophoresis or other size separation techniques or can be dot blotted without size separation. The polynucleotide probes are preferably labeled. Suitable labels, and methods for labeling probes are known in the art, and include, for example, radioactive labels incorporated by nick translation or by kinase, biotin, fluorescent probes, and chemiluminescent probes. The polynucleotides from the sample are then treated with the probe under hybridization conditions of suitable stringencies. The stringency of hybridization conditions for a polynucleotide encoding a variant polypeptide of the invention to a polynucleotide encoding polypeptides shown in SEQ ID NOs:1-36 can be, for example, 10% formamide, 5\u00d7SSPE, 1\u00d7Denhart's solution, and 1\u00d7 salmon sperm DNA (low stringency conditions). More preferable conditions are, 25% formamide, 5\u00d7SSPE, 1\u00d7Denhart's solution, and 1\u00d7 salmon sperm DNA (moderate stringency conditions), and even more preferable conditions are, 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSPE, 1\u00d7Denhart's solution, and 1\u00d7 salmon sperm DNA (high stringency conditions). However, several factors influence the stringency of hybridization other than the above-described formamide concentration, and one skilled in the art can suitably select these factors to accomplish a similar stringency. See e.g., Ausubel (ed.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. (1994); Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)). That is, a polynucleotide encoding a variant polypeptide of the invention will hybridize to a polynucleotide encoding SEQ ID NOs:1-36 under low or high or both stringency conditions. An isolated polynucleotide is a nucleic acid molecule that is not immediately contiguous with one or both of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking sequences with which it is normally contiguous when present in a naturally occurring genome. Therefore, an isolated polynucleotide can be, for example, a polynucleotide that is incorporated into a vector, such as a plasmid or viral vector, a polynucleotide that is incorporated into the genome of a heterologous cell (or the genome of a homologous cell, but at a site different from that where it naturally occurs); and a polynucleotide that exists as a separate molecule such as a polynucleotide produced by PCR amplification, chemically synthesis, restriction enzyme digestion, or in vitro transcription. An isolated polynucleotide is also a nucleic acid molecule, such as a recombinant nucleic acid molecule that forms part of hybrid polynucleotide encoding additional polypeptide sequences that can be used for example, in the production of a fusion protein. A polynucleotide can also comprise one or more expression control sequences such as promoters or enhancers, for example. A polynucleotide of the invention can be present in a vector, such as, for example, an expression vector. If desired, polynucleotides can be cloned into an expression vector comprising, for example, promoters, enhancers, or other expression control sequences that drive expression of the polynucleotides of the invention in host cells. The polynucleotides can be operably linked to the expression control sequences. Vectors and Host Cells A polypeptide can be expressed in systems, e.g., cultured cells, which result in substantially the same post-translational modifications present as when the polypeptide is expressed in a native cell, or in systems that result in the alteration or omission of post-translational modifications, e.g., glycosylation or cleavage, present when expressed in a native cell. An expression vector can be, for example, a plasmid, such as pBR322, pUC, or ColE1, or an adenovirus vector, such as an adenovirus Type 2 vector or Type 5 vector. Vectors suitable for use in the present invention include, for example, bacterial vectors, mammalian vectors, viral vectors (such as retroviral, adenoviral, adeno-associated viral, herpes virus, simian virus 40 (SV40), and bovine papilloma virus vectors) and baculovirus-derived vectors for use in insect cells. Polynucleotides in such vectors are preferably operably linked to a promoter, which is selected based on, e.g., the cell type in which expression is sought. The expression vector can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. The invention includes host cells containing polynucleotides encoding an antibody of the invention (e.g., whole antibody, a heavy or light chain thereof, or portion thereof, or a single chain antibody of the invention, or a fragment or variant thereof), operably linked to a heterologous promoter. For the expression of entire antibody molecules, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule. Host cells into which vectors, such as expression vectors, comprising polynucleotides of the invention can be introduced include, for example, prokaryotic cells (e.g., bacterial cells) and eukaryotic cells (e.g., yeast cells; fungal cells; plant cells; insect cells; and mammalian cells). Such host cells are available from a number of different sources that are known to those skilled in the art, e.g., the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, Va. Host cells into which the polynucleotides of the invention have been introduced, as well as their progeny, even if not identical to the parental cells, due to mutations, are included in the invention. Host cells can be transformed with the expression vectors to express the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof. Host cells expressing antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention include cells and hybridomas transformed with a polynucleotide of the invention. One embodiment of the invention provides methods of producing a recombinant cell that expresses a canine CD20 antibody, antigen-binding fragment thereof or portion thereof, comprising transfecting a cell with a vector comprising a polynucleotide of the invention. A canine CD20 antibody, or fragment, or portion thereof, can then be produced by expressing the polypeptide in the recombinant host cell. Isolation and purification of polypeptides produced in the systems described above can be carried out using conventional methods, appropriate for the particular system. For example, preparative chromatography and immunological separations employing antibodies, such as monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, can be used. Methods of Treatment Antibodies of the invention can used to treat, ameliorate, or prevent canine CD20+ B-cell lymphoma, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other disease or disorder associated with aberrant CD20 or B-cell expression (e.g., over-expression of B cells or CD20 or dysfunctional B cells). The invention also encompasses multimodal therapeutic methods wherein anti-CD20 antibody administration is supplemented with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, anti-angiogenesis agents, anti-inflammatory agents or therapeutic proteins, such as immunoconjugates and antibody fusion proteins. Combinations can be administered either concomitantly, e.g., as an admixture; separately but simultaneously or concurrently; or sequentially. This includes presentations where the combined agents are administered together as a therapeutic mixture, and also procedures where the combined agents are administered separately but simultaneously, e.g., as through separate intravenous lines into the same individual. Administration \u201cin combination\u201d further includes the separate administration of one of the compounds or agents given first, followed by the second. In general, the dosage of administered anti-CD20 antibodies, anti-CD20 antibody components, will vary depending upon such factors as the canine's age, weight, sex, general medical condition and previous medical history. Typically, it is desirable to provide the recipient with a dosage of antibody that is in the range of from about 1 pg\/kg to 1,000 mg\/kg (or any range between 1 pg\/kg to 1,000 mg\/kg) (amount of agent\/body weight of canine), although a lower or higher dosage also may be administered as circumstances dictate. Other mammals can be treated with anti-CD20 antibodies of the invention including, for examples, cats and ferrets. Administration of antibodies and antibody components to a patient can be orally or parenterally. For example, compositions of the invention can be delivered by injection, nasal formulation, pulmonary formulation, and cutaneous formulation. Injections can be delivered systemically or locally, intravenously, intraarterially, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrapleurally, intrathecally, by perfusion through a regional catheter, or by direct intralesional injection. When administering antibodies by injection, the administration can be by continuous infusion or by single or multiple boluses. Compositions of the invention can comprise anti-CD20 antibodies and a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, for example, sterile saline, sterile buffered water, propylene glycol. Methods for preparing administrable agents, such as parenterally administrable agents, are described in Pharmaceutical Carriers & Formulations, Martin, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th Ed. (Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa. 1975). An antibody formulation of the invention can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and\/or additives. For example, carriers can include, without limitation, surfactants, excipients, antioxidants, coloring agents, flavoring agents, preservatives, stabilizers, buffering agents, chelating agents, suspending agents, isotonizing agents, binders, disintegrators, lubricants, fluidity promoters, and corrigents. Antibody formulations can also comprise proteins such as serum albumin, gelatin, and immunoglobulin, and amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, and lysine. Aqueous antibody formulations can comprise an isotonic solution comprising, for example, physiological saline, dextrose, and other adjuvants, including, for example, D-sorbitol, D-mannose, D-mannitol, and sodium chloride, which can also contain solubilizing agents and non-ionic detergents. Antibody formulations can be encapsulated in microcapsules made of, e.g., hydroxycellulose, gelatin, polymethylmethacrylate, and made into components of colloidal drug delivery systems (liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles, and nano-capsules). See Remington's Pharmaceutical Science 16th edition, Oslo Ed. (1980)). Polynucleotides encoding antibodies can be used for gene therapy. Gene therapy is therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible polynucleotide. Polynucleotides produce their encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect. See Goldspiel et al., Clinical Pharmacy 12:488-505 (1993); Wu & Wu, Biotherapy 3:87-95 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926-932 (1993); and Morgan & Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217 (1993); May, TIBTECH 11(5):155-215 (1993). A composition for gene therapy can comprise polynucleotides encoding an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. The polynucleotides can be present in an expression vector that expresses the antibody or fragments thereof in a suitable host. The polynucleotides can include enhancers and\/or promoters, such as heterologous promoters, that are operably linked to an antibody coding region. The promoter can be inducible, constitutive, and\/or tissue-specific. Polynucleotides can be used wherein the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding polynucleotides. See Koller & Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435-438 (1989). Delivery of the polynucleotides into a subject can be direct, wherein the subject is directly exposed to the polynucleotide or expression vectors, or indirect, wherein cells are first transformed with the polynucleotides in vitro, then transplanted into the subject. Polynucleotides of the invention can be directly administered in vivo, where they are expressed to produce antibodies or fragments thereof. Direct administration includes, e.g., infection using defective or attenuated retroviruses or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), by direct injection of naked DNA, by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), coating the polynucleotides with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering the polynucleotides linked to a peptide that is known to enter the nucleus by e.g., administering the polynucleotides linked to a ligand that can undergo receptor mediated endocytosis. See Wu & Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987). In another embodiment, polynucleotide-ligand complexes can be formed where the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the polynucleotide to avoid lysosomal degradation. Polynucleotides can also be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression by targeting the polynucleotides to a specific receptor. See PCT Publications WO 92\/06180; WO 92\/22635; WO92\/20316; WO93\/14188; WO 93\/20221). Compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc. All patents, patent applications, and other scientific or technical writings referred to anywhere herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

EXAMPLES Peptides Derived from Canine CD20 The predicted structure of canine CD20 is that of a type III 4-span membrane protein, having two extracellular domains. Extracellular domain 1 encompasses approximately 5 amino acids, and extracellular domain 2 encompasses approximately 50 amino acids. A polypeptide sequence was identified that represents the predominant extracellular domain (ED) 2 of the canine CD20 protein. This ED peptide was synthesized alone: SEQ ID NO: 33 DIFNITISHFLKMENLNLIKAPIPYVDIHNCDPANPSEKNSLSIQYCGS IRSV and in conjunction with a murine T-cell epitope from ovalbumin: SEQ ID NO: 34 DDLQAVHAAHAEINEADHIDIDDIFNITISHFLKMENLNLIKAPIPYVD IHNCDPANPSEKNSLSIQYCGSIRSV. The latter peptide was conjugated to KLH and used to immunize mice with the intention of generating monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular domain 2 of canine CD20. CD20 ELISA for Hybridoma Screening A polypeptide ELISA was performed by dissolving 1 mg of ED peptide (SEQ ID NO:33) in 1 ml of DMSO (Sigma). Polypeptides were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (Immunlon 4HB, Dynatech) at a concentration of 10 ug\/ml in 50 mM carbonate (pH 9) overnight at room temperature. Plates were washed four times in PBS-T (phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2), 0.05% TWEEN\u00ae 20 (polysorbate)) and blocked with 2% TWEEN\u00ae 20 (polysorbate) in 100 mM Tris (pH7.4) for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed four times in PBS-T before hybridoma supernatants or purified antibody was added. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, washed four times in PBS-T, and a 1:2500 dilution of goat anti-mouse HRPO (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in sample diluent (50 mM Tris (pH 7.2), 0.05% TWEEN\u00ae 20 (polysorbate), 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) was added. Following an one hour incubation at room temperature, plates were washed six times in PBS-T and developed with a TMB substrate. Fusion and Hybridoma Screening Standard fusion protocols were followed to generate initial hybridomas. An anti-mouse conjugate specific for the Fc portion of murine IgG was used to identify positive clones on CD20-peptide coated ELISA plates. Positive clones were propagated using a modified limiting dilution technique. Because the hybridomas were initially difficult to culture when plated at a very low number of cells per well, the subcloning was performed gradually, and with time the cells demonstrated stability and consistent proliferation. Hybridoma supernatant was tested to determine isotype using a commercially available kit (Roche Applied Sciences). Table 1 lists the 4 IgG hybridomas and their isotype. TABLE 1 Antibody Isotype 6C8 IgG1 4F1 IgG3 14A12 IgG2b 18D3 IgG2b The hybridomas were deposited on Aug. 27, 2008, under the Budapest Treaty at American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Blvd. Manassas Va., 20110, as follows: 4F1: PTA-9433; 6C8: PTA-9434; 14A12: PTA-9435; 18D3:PTA-9436. The variable heavy and variable light chains were cloned and sequenced for each monoclonal antibody. Ascites Production Four IgG secreting hybridomas were used to generate ascites according to standard methods. Following routine purification, the immunoglobulin was titered on the CD20-peptide ELISA (FIGS. 1A-B). Monoclonal antibody 6C8 has the greatest affinity for the canine CD20 extracellular domain 2 peptide (FIG. 1B). Immunofluorescent Labeling of B-Cell Lymphoma: Lymph node aspirates from a dog with a diagnosed B-cell lymphoma were labeled with hybridoma supernatant from 3 of the 4 cell lines. Each smear was outlined with an ImmEdge\u2122 pen (Vector Labs), allowed to dry, and then fixed in acetone for 3 minutes. Following a 5 minute wash in PBS (pH 7.2), slides were treated with ammonium chloride (50 mM in PBS) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Following a 5 minute wash in PBS, slides were blocked in PBS\/NGS (PBS with 15% normal goat serum) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Each hybridoma supernatant was then added to the slide and incubated for one hour at room temperature. Slides were washed twice for 5 minutes in PBS, followed by a 30 minute incubation in a 1:200 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgM+IgG (H+L) F(ab)2 FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS\/NGS. Following two 5 minute washes in PBS, slides were examined using fluorescent microscopy. All 3 of the clones tested showed immunofluorescent labeling of the canine B-cells, while monoclonal antibodies specific for the extracellular domain of human CD20 (1F5 (ATCC HB9645) and B1 (Biogenex)) did not label the canine B-cells. Flow Cytometric Labeling of B-Cell Lymphoma Fluorescent conjugates of all four IgG anti-canine CD20 monoclonal antibodies were made using a commercially available kit (Invitrogen, AF647 monoclonal antibody labeling kit, A20186). Antibody conjugates were used to label a lymph node aspirate from a dog diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma. 3.0\u00d7106 white blood cells were added to 3 ml of PBS\/FBS (pH 7.2). and centrifuged at 900 g for 2 minutes (or 45 seconds in Drucker Model 642B centrifuge; 1600 g). The supernatant was removed with care to not disrupt the cell pellet. The cells were resuspended in 600 ul PBS\/FBS. Two to six ul of each of the anti-canine CD20 AF647 antibody was placed into a separate plastic 12\u00d775 tube. Isotype controls labeled with AF647 were used at a similar concentration in separate tubes. 100 ul of the cell suspension was placed into each tube. The cells were incubated for a minimum of 30 minutes in refrigerator and then diluted with 0.5-2.0 ml of PBS\/FBS. Flow cytometry was performed on a Beckman Coulter Epics ELITE following routine procedures. All four monoclonal antibodies labeled the B-lymphocytes in the sample, with 6C8 having the brightest labeling of the four. In order to confirm that antibodies specific for an extracellular domain of human CD20 do not cross react with canine lymphocytes several experiments were conducted. Both the 1F5 (ATCC HB9645) and B1 (Biogenex) monoclonal antibodies, which are specific for an extracellular domain of human CD20, were evaluated on human and canine lymphocytes by flow cytometry. Labeling of cells for flow cytometry was performed per the suppliers recommended concentrations (B1) or with neat culture supernatant (1F5). Controls included antibodies of the same isotype with the same direct label or an irrelevant antibody of the same isotype in culture supernatant. Whole blood samples used a commercial lysing reagent (PharmLyse) according to manufacturer's instructions. Both the B1 and 1F5 antibodies successfully labeled human B-lymphocytes. Neither B1 nor 1F5 demonstrated specific labeling of canine B-cells. Characterization of CD20 Extracellular Domain 2 The monoclonal antibodies were tested for binding to regions of the canine CD20 extracellular domain 2 (SEQ ID NO:33) using SEQ ID NO:35 APIPYVDIHNCDPA NPSEKNSLSIQYCGSIRSV (\u201cC-terminal polypeptide\u201d). This polypeptide was tested for binding as a linear polypeptide and as a cyclized polypeptide. SEQ ID NO:36 ISHFLKMENLNLIKAPIPYVDIHNCDPANPSEKNSL (\u201cN-terminal polypeptide\u201d) was also tested. The results are shown in Table 2. TABLE 2 4F1 6C8 14A12 18D3 SEQ ID NO: 33 Binding Binding Binding Binding SEQ ID NO: 35 Binding No Binding Binding Binding (linear) SEQ ID NO: 35 Binding No Binding Binding Binding (cyclized) SEQ ID NO: 36 No Binding No Binding No Binding Binding The results in Table 2 show that while all four monoclonal antibodies recognize the full-length canine CD20 extracellular domain 2 peptide (SEQ ID NO:33), the epitope recognized by 6C8 is in the amino-terminal portion of the extracellular domain 2, while the epitope(s) recognized by 4F1, 14A12 and 18D3 is\/are in the carboxy-terminal portion of the extracellular domain 2.","cpc_label":"C07K162887","ipc_label":"C07K1628","filing_date":"20160101","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20160512","examiner_id":"96134.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: the present invention include, for example, bacterial vectors, mammalian vectors, viral vectors (such as retroviral, adenoviral, adeno-associated viral, herpes virus, simian virus 40 (SV40), and bovine papilloma virus vectors) and baculovirus-derived vectors for use in insect cells., in the context of the novelty:  The invention provides canine CD20 specific antibodies, methods of making the antibodies and methods of use of the antibodies .

With the continuous intensification of teaching reformation, experimental course's status in teaching is continuously enhanced. Experiment teaching has an irreplaceable role in developing students' innovative consciousness, manipulative ability, the abilities of analyzing and solving problems, etc. The evaluation of student achievement in the experimental course is a correct evaluation of students' experimental knowledge and skill level and also objectively reflects the experiment teaching effect, so it becomes an important means of understanding the teaching effect and improving the teaching method for teachers. Generally speaking, the evaluation of student achievement in the experimental course comprises several achievements like attendance information, operation evaluation, original data authenticity affirmation, experimental report evaluation, etc. Attendance information can be determined by many modes, e.g., signing on an attendance form by students, calling the roll by the teachers according to students' name list, using an identification card with student information to punch card, using a fingerprint reader for discriminating identities, etc. Attendance information is the basis of evaluating other achievements. The check of attendance can be used for finding violations of absenteeism, lateness, early leaving, replacement, etc. to ensure that the students consistently finish the entire experiment. However, the statistics of the normal attendance will be influenced by replacing other students to sign on the attendance, replacing other students to answer the teacher when the teacher calls the roll according to the students' name list, replacing other students to punch cards when using the identification card with student information to punch the cards, etc. Operation evaluation is made by the teachers through patrol in the process of the experiment and observation of students' operation so as to evaluate the achievement of this part. The teachers have an evaluation according to correctness, normalization and proficiency of students' experimental operation, accurate mastery of experimental flow, post-experiment cleaning, collation, etc. Operation evaluation is finished subjectively by experimental instructors. The experimental instructors need to continuously patrol and observe to find various problems of the students in operation. If the experimental instructors cannot frequently patrol or find the problems in time, the students' experimental achievement cannot be comprehensively and accurately evaluated. The students will obtain all kinds of original data in the experiment and will obtain the experimental result after processing the data. For various purposes, the students will plagiarize or fabricate original data. One reason is that the experimental result is an important composition of ultimately evaluating student achievement. To obtain better achievement, some students modify real original data into the data for obtaining higher achievement. This modification of the real data may occur after the students just obtain the original data or in the process of writing the experimental report. Under this condition, the experimental instructors now adopt the mode of signing on the original data to ensure that the students cannot modify the data in the process of writing the experimental report, but cannot prevent the students from modifying the data just after obtaining the original data. The other reason is that some students use the time gap of the patrol of the experimental instructors to plagiarize or fabricate the data without performing an experiment. In case of plagiarizing the data, the experimental instructors identify plagiarism mainly through memory, but objectively speaking, the discovery rate of plagiarism is very low. In addition, Lin Jie and Wu Zhengfan mention a computer-based discrimination system for plagiarism of experimental report in Construction of Experimental Platform and Teaching Reformation for Preventing Plagiarism of Experimental Report in which the entire experimental report is submitted to the computer for comparing the similarity, but do not clearly mention the comparison situation of the original data. In case of fabricating the data, the experimental instructors can only judge and discriminate from individual data that obviously does not conform to the experimental result that whether the data belongs to the fabricated data, but do not have any methods to discriminate the fabricated data that conforms to the experimental law. It is observed from the above analysis that it is difficult to ensure the authenticity of the original data by the existing measure, so the affirmation of the authenticity of the original data is an obvious weakness for achievement evaluation of the whole student experimental course. Now there are two modes for evaluating accuracy and precision of the experimental data and correctness of the experimental data processing procedure: the first one is that the experimental instructors calculate and compare their results with the calculation result of the students when finding a doubtful point in reviewing the experimental report based on many years of experience of reviewing the experimental report; and the other one is that the data is inputted into a computer, processed according to a correct processing method and compared with the calculation result of the students. The evaluation of the experimental report also comprises the evaluation of the integrity of the entire experimental report, correctness of experimental conclusion, etc. Although the evaluation of the experimental achievement shall contain the above contents, because of larger workload of the experimental instructors and difficulty in objectively, comprehensively, fully and accurately recording operation evaluation, affirmation of authenticity of the original data, etc., the existing experimental achievement is mainly determined by attendance and the experimental report and the experimental levels of the students cannot be comprehensively reflected. In addition, the existing evaluation of the experimental achievement mainly comes from the individual evaluation achievement of the experimental teachers. The strong individual subjectivity of teachers during evaluation leads to the strong individual subjectivity of experimental achievement, so that the experimental truth of the students cannot be reflected without corresponding objective evaluation. On the other hand, because low-value easy-consumption instruments used in the experiment have the defects of large quantity, easy loss, quick damage and low price, the informationization management cannot be realized. When there are many operating personnel in a laboratory to simultaneously work, experimental instruments may be mixed, causing it difficult to distinguish the responsibilities for loss and damage of the experimental instruments. This is especially apparent in the experiment of the students. The students are admitted to the student laboratory to perform the experiment in different periods of time each year. Each laboratory often circularly admits students in multiple classes to perform the experiment. The experimental instruments on an experimental platform are also used jointly by each class. But because basic operating training is mostly conducted by the students and the students are not skilled in experimental operation, the experimental instruments are frequently mixed, lost and damaged. In order not to influence the experiment, the lost and damaged experimental instruments shall be supplemented in time and compensated by responsible persons. However, because there are many experimental instruments with the same specification, it is very difficult to confirm the persons responsible for mixing, loss and damage of the instruments. The existing common management methods are that: 1. The students individually use a set of experimental instruments. When entering the laboratory, the students check and confirm to receive the full set of instruments. After all the experiments are finished, all the instruments are returned to the laboratory. If the instruments are lost or damaged, it will be treated according to the laboratory rule. 2. Many students alternately share one set of experimental instruments. Each student checks and confirms to receive the full set of instruments before the experiment. Instruments lost or damaged shall be reported to the teachers in time for registration and supplementation. After the experiment, the full set of instruments is checked. The instruments lost or damaged shall be reported to the teachers in time for registration and supplementation. After this, the above work is repeated for each experiment. These management methods also have problems in actual operation. For example, after the students finish the experiment, they do not carefully check the experimental instruments and do not find that some instruments are damaged or lost. When the students finish the experiment and check the experimental instruments, the instruments are not damaged and lost, but the instruments are taken away or damaged by other classmates after the students leave the laboratory. Both of the situations will cause that the classmates of the next class find that the experimental instruments are reduced or damaged during check, but the classmates of the previous class believe that they clearly check the instruments at the end of the experiment and consider that the compensation is unreasonable. The solution to this is that the instructors check and confirm each set of experimental instruments for completeness in person at the end of the experiment of each student, which greatly increases the workload of the teachers and the students. These methods belong to manual operation management and have the defects of complicated operation, large labor intensity of the teachers, low management efficiency, serious compensatory hysteresis etc. There are now many computer systems related to laboratory management and assessment of student experiment level. For example: Chinese Invention Patent Application No. 201210161009.1 discloses a comprehensive management system for a laboratory, comprising a computer and comprehensive management software of the laboratory, wherein the comprehensive management software of the laboratory is installed in the computer; the comprehensive management software of the laboratory comprises a portal website construction module, a laboratory information management module, a basic data setting module, a laboratory instrument device management module, a laboratory material consumable management module and a laboratory monitoring module, but the application does not mention how the modules are concretely operated.

The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1 , characterized in that: Wherein the monitoring module comprises video monitoring sub-module and the mobile monitoring sub-module Wherein the video monitoring sub-module comprises an audio and video collecting device and an audio output device installed in the laboratory, a video display device and an audio input and output device installed in the monitoring room and corresponding software; The experimental instructors observe student experimental operating situation through video display. Besides, they can observe laboratory overall situation to find whether students violate provisions of the laboratory through the video collecting device installed in the experimental platform. Through the video collecting device installed in the experimental platform or platform extension line, teachers can observe whether the operation of students is correct. And experiment instructors can observe whether the use of public instruments and taking public reagent operation are correct through monitoring video devices installed in the public instrument operation area and reagent supply area; Experimental instructors can point out students' problems in experiment through the audio output device in the laboratory, and provide problems found in experiment to the central processing module; Through the video monitoring, teachers can timely and appropriately correct students' operation errors during experiment, and evaluate students' operation skills. In addition, the video monitoring can make students do experiment more carefully, and if some instruments are damaged, it can also trace to the responsible person in time. In order to complete this operation evaluation, the position of the experimental operating desk of each student needs to be fixed. When all the students finish filling their experiment position information in a sheet, teachers will count and input the information into the central processing module for recording. Video collecting devices like camera need to be installed in the laboratory, and connected to the central processing module. There are two kinds of video collecting, devices. One is used to observe the laboratory overall situation, mainly for observing whether violations of laboratory provisions, such as slapstick, exist in the laboratory. The other is installed in the position where student operation can be observed, mainly used for observing whether the student operation is correct.

Finally, the mobile monitoring sub-module provides the identification of types of student operation error and types of violations of laboratory provisions to the central processing module by wireless way. After laboratory cleaning, experimental instructors check sanitation situation and deduct marks for those students on duty who fail to meet cleaning requirements, and then provide related information to the central processing module. Violations of laboratory provisions include but not limited to laboratory safety management provision, sanitary control provision and the like. 6. The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1 , characterized in that: The instrument management module is responsible for the statistics of instrument usage, loss, damage, compensation, and provides related information to the central processing module. The hardware of the instrument management module includes a bar code scanner and experimental instruments with bar codes. The bar code on each experimental instrument is not the same; Before experimental course, students will initially confirm whether the instruments is in good condition, then scan bar codes on the instruments into database, so information that the student is responsible for the instrument is stored into the database. Students scan bar codes on their responsible experiment instruments before each experiment and compared with information in the database in order to confirm experiment instruments are in good condition; If students find instrument instrument is damaged in inspection at the beginning of the experiment, they need to scan damaged instrument bar code and provide it to the central processing module, damaged instruments should be stored into damaged instrument area; an experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to get a new instrument of same type from experimental instrument manager and scan the new bar code to update database; then the experimental instrument manager will identify students who damage the instrument by evidences like experiment arrangement and video monitoring, and inform the related student to compensate by the student interface module. If the students check and find that the experimental instruments that do not belong to their responsible instruments appear in storage positions of their responsible experimental instruments at the beginning of the experiment, they can confirm the responsible students of the experimental instruments through the bar codes on the experimental instruments and return the misplaced experimental instruments to the related students. If the students check and find that some of their responsible experimental instruments are missing at the beginning of the experiment compared with their responsible experimental instruments in the information database, they need to wait for other students to scan the bar codes of the experimental instruments and ask whether they find the missing experimental instruments. If the missing experimental instruments are found, the students get them back; and if the missing experimental instruments are not found, the students should provide the bar code information of the missing instruments to the central processing module. Then an experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to receive a same type new instrument, scan the bar code of the new instrument for registration and update the information database of the student instrument; after that, the experimental instrument manager confirms the students who damage the instrument according to the experimental information like experimental arrangement and the evidence like video monitoring and notifies the students who damage the instrument in the student interface module to do compensation. If the students damage the experimental instrument in the experiment, they need to scan and provide the bar code information of the damaged instruments to the central processing module and store the damaged instrument to the damaged instrument area; the experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to get a new instrument of same type, scan the bar code of the new instrument for registration and update the information database of the student instrument; after that, the experimental instrument manager confirms the students who damage the instrument and notifies the students who damage the instrument in the student interface module to do compensation. If the students damage the experimental instrument and the bar code at the same time, they need to manually input the information related to the instrument, provide the information of the damaged instrument to the central processing module and store the damaged instrument to the damaged instrument area. The experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to get a new instrument of same type, scan the bar code of the new iinstrument for registration and update the information database of the student instrument; after that, the experimental instrument manager confirms the students who damage the instrument and notifies the students who damage the instrument in the student interface module to do compensation. After the experiment, the students need to put their responsible experimental instruments on normal storing areas, and scan the bar codes again in order to confirm that their responsible experimental instruments are not missing and misplaced. The instrument management module automatically calculates out the compensation amount of each student as damage of the experimental instruments and sends the compensation amount to the central processing module. The central processing module sends the amount information to be compensated for each student due to damage of the experimental instruments to the student interface module of the students, and meanwhile makes a copy for the experimental instrument manager of the class of the student. Finally, the experimental instrument manager of the class should collect all the compensation fees of the experimental instruments of the whole experimental class and turn over money to experimental instructors. If the damage of the experimental instrument is found by the students themselves and the students actively compensate for them, compensation ratio can be reduced according to the circumstances; and if the damage of the experimental instrument is found by the next experiment classmates, the students who damage the experimental instrument need to pay for them as a high compensation ratio. 7. The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1 , characterized in that: The experimental data and image identification module comprises an image collecting device, an image transmission device and image identification software; After reading the original data of the experiment, the students use the image collecting device to shoot an image of the original data of the experiment and then use the image transmission device to transmit the data to the image identification software. The image identification software reads and provides the original data of the experiment in the image by an image identification method to the experimental data processing and analysis module and the central processing module. The original data of the experiment read by the image identification way is compared with students' experimental data and analyzed so as to inspect whether students' original data of the experiment is real and prevent the students from modifying the original data or plagiarizing others' data. The experimental data input interface module receives students' experimental data transmitted by the experimental instrument data communication interface, and then provides the data to the experimental data processing and analysis module and the central processing module. For example, an electronic balance is essentially equipped with an RS232 data communication interface. The experimental data of the students can be directly transmitted from the electronic balance. The experimental data input interface module receives student weighing data transmitted from the data communication interface of the electronic balance and provides the same to the central processing module. 8. The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1 , characterized in that: The experimental test sample module comprises a test sample, a test sample information database etc. Each experiment has 2 to 15 test samples which have significant difference in measured quantitative characteristics. Each test sample is made into an independently packed test sample applicable to each student or experimental group, and an information carrier in which feature combined codes are stored is adhered to the test sample or the package of the test sample. The quantitative characteristic value of each test sample and the corresponding feature combined code information are inputted into a sample information database and associated. The students get test samples before the experiment and scan the received carrier in which the feature combined code information is stored on the test samples through a feature combined code information reading device. The feature combined code information reading device sends the scanned feature combined code information of the test samples to the experimental test sample module. After receiving the feature combined code information about the test samples sent by students, the experimental test sample module finds the corresponding measured characteristic of the feature combined code information in the test sample information database, associates the students with the standard values of the measured quantitative characteristics of the received test samples, and then sends the conditions to the experimental data processing and analysis module and the central processing module. The measured characteristics can be some quantitative nature of the test sample to be measured and determined in the experiment, such as chemical property. In an analytical chemistry experiment \u201cDetermination of Molar Mass of Organic Acid\u201d provides two organic acids of different molar masses, i.e., oxalic acid and citric acid. Another example is that in physical chemistry experiment \u201cDetermination of Molecular Weight by Cryoscopic Method\u201d provides two kinds of materials to be tested of different molecular weights, i.e., naphthalene and anthracene. In addition, the measured characteristics can also be such physical property as acoustics, optics, thermotics, magnetics, electrics, etc. These examples are only for bettering understanding, but not for limiting the scope of the measured characteristics. The test samples can be self-made or purchased; whatever the sources are, the measured characteristics of different test samples in the same laboratory shall have significant differences. For example, in the test sample provided in the experiment of \u201cDetermination of Contents of Sodium Carbonate and Sodium Hydroxide in Mixed Alkali\u201d, the mass percentage of the sodium hydroxide and the mass percentage of the sodium carbonate in the mixed alkali test sample of the sodium hydroxide and the sodium carbonate are different. After such test samples are distributed randomly to the students, the students cannot determine their test samples belong to which kind of test samples and cannot know the possible contents of the test samples. Therefore, the students can not plagiarize the data from other students or fabricate the data, so they should determine seriously by themselves. The practice enhances the teaching quality and effect. There is similar practice in laboratories for providing test samples before, but currently the combination of the practice with automatic identification technology has not been reported, 9. The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1 , characterized in that: The experimental data processing and analysis module receives students' experimental original data identified in an image identification way, students' experimental data transmitted from the experimental instrument data output interface, the test sample information provided by the experimental test sample module, experimental data read by the students themselves and calculating results. The experimental data processing and analysis module compares the received students' experimental original data identified in the image identification way, students' experimental data transmitted from the experimental instrument data output interface and the experimental data read by the students themselves to evaluate the accurate situation of reading the original data by the students. The experimental data processing and analysis module compares the received test sample information provided by the experimental test sample module with the calculation result of the students to evaluate the accurate situation of the test results of the students. The experimental data processing and analysis module integrates the accurate situation of reading the original data by the students and the accurate situation of the test results of the students and forms the entire situation of the experimental data of the students and provides the same to the central processing module. The experimental data processing and analysis module analyzes the accuracy or\/and precision of the students' experimental original data identified in the image identification way, students' experimental data transmitted from the experimental instrument data output interface and the experimental data read by the students themselves in accordance with the data processing and analysis requirements of an experiment teaching material, and provides the accuracy or\/and precision analysis result to the central processing module. The experimental data processing and analysis module needs to perform analysis according to experimental principles and required experimental results of different experiments and can use data processing software such as Excel or self-written program, etc. to form a \u201cdata processor\u201d for processing the experimental data of the students. 10. The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1 , characterized in that: The computer written test module of experimental knowledge tests the students about experimental knowledge by the computer exam system, and then provides exam results to the central processing module. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge comprises an objective question examination database of each experimental course that comprises choice questions and true or false questions provided in the laboratory. The students enter the computer written test module of experimental knowledge through the student interface module. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge randomly extracts examination questions from the objective question examination database of the experimental course of the students to form examination paper provided to the examination students. The examination students answer the examination paper. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge receives the answers of the examination students and compares the same with standard answers, and then provides the answering information of the examination students to the central processing module. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge can test the entire mastering condition of the students for the experimental knowledge. The experimental report achievement is reviewed by the teacher. The teacher can give the students fair and reasonable experimental report achievement according to students' preview condition, writing standardized degree, serious degree, etc. with combination of the teacher's teaching experience, and then inputs the achievement into the central processing module.

The contents of all of the aforementioned applications, including any, intervening amendments thereto, are incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement, belongs to the field of teaching management and evaluation, and more particularly to a system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on an automatic identification technology. BACKGROUND Science needs equal attention to theory and practice, and related experiments shall be conducted while in theoretical study. With the continuous intensification of teaching reformation, experimental course's status in teaching is continuously enhanced. Experiment teaching has an irreplaceable role in developing students' innovative consciousness, manipulative ability, the abilities of analyzing and solving problems, etc. The evaluation of student achievement in the experimental course is a correct evaluation of students' experimental knowledge and skill level and also objectively reflects the experiment teaching effect, so it becomes an important means of understanding the teaching effect and improving the teaching method for teachers. Generally speaking, the evaluation of student achievement in the experimental course comprises several achievements like attendance information, operation evaluation, original data authenticity affirmation, experimental report evaluation, etc. Attendance information can be determined by many modes, e.g., signing on an attendance form by students, calling the roll by the teachers according to students' name list, using an identification card with student information to punch card, using a fingerprint reader for discriminating identities, etc. Attendance information is the basis of evaluating other achievements. The check of attendance can be used for finding violations of absenteeism, lateness, early leaving, replacement, etc. to ensure that the students consistently finish the entire experiment. However, the statistics of the normal attendance will be influenced by replacing other students to sign on the attendance, replacing other students to answer the teacher when the teacher calls the roll according to the students' name list, replacing other students to punch cards when using the identification card with student information to punch the cards, etc. Operation evaluation is made by the teachers through patrol in the process of the experiment and observation of students' operation so as to evaluate the achievement of this part. The teachers have an evaluation according to correctness, normalization and proficiency of students' experimental operation, accurate mastery of experimental flow, post-experiment cleaning, collation, etc. Operation evaluation is finished subjectively by experimental instructors. The experimental instructors need to continuously patrol and observe to find various problems of the students in operation. If the experimental instructors cannot frequently patrol or find the problems in time, the students' experimental achievement cannot be comprehensively and accurately evaluated. The students will obtain all kinds of original data in the experiment and will obtain the experimental result after processing the data. For various purposes, the students will plagiarize or fabricate original data. One reason is that the experimental result is an important composition of ultimately evaluating student achievement. To obtain better achievement, some students modify real original data into the data for obtaining higher achievement. This modification of the real data may occur after the students just obtain the original data or in the process of writing the experimental report. Under this condition, the experimental instructors now adopt the mode of signing on the original data to ensure that the students cannot modify the data in the process of writing the experimental report, but cannot prevent the students from modifying the data just after obtaining the original data. The other reason is that some students use the time gap of the patrol of the experimental instructors to plagiarize or fabricate the data without performing an experiment. In case of plagiarizing the data, the experimental instructors identify plagiarism mainly through memory, but objectively speaking, the discovery rate of plagiarism is very low. In addition, Lin Jie and Wu Zhengfan mention a computer-based discrimination system for plagiarism of experimental report in Construction of Experimental Platform and Teaching Reformation for Preventing Plagiarism of Experimental Report in which the entire experimental report is submitted to the computer for comparing the similarity, but do not clearly mention the comparison situation of the original data. In case of fabricating the data, the experimental instructors can only judge and discriminate from individual data that obviously does not conform to the experimental result that whether the data belongs to the fabricated data, but do not have any methods to discriminate the fabricated data that conforms to the experimental law. It is observed from the above analysis that it is difficult to ensure the authenticity of the original data by the existing measure, so the affirmation of the authenticity of the original data is an obvious weakness for achievement evaluation of the whole student experimental course. Now there are two modes for evaluating accuracy and precision of the experimental data and correctness of the experimental data processing procedure: the first one is that the experimental instructors calculate and compare their results with the calculation result of the students when finding a doubtful point in reviewing the experimental report based on many years of experience of reviewing the experimental report; and the other one is that the data is inputted into a computer, processed according to a correct processing method and compared with the calculation result of the students. The evaluation of the experimental report also comprises the evaluation of the integrity of the entire experimental report, correctness of experimental conclusion, etc. Although the evaluation of the experimental achievement shall contain the above contents, because of larger workload of the experimental instructors and difficulty in objectively, comprehensively, fully and accurately recording operation evaluation, affirmation of authenticity of the original data, etc., the existing experimental achievement is mainly determined by attendance and the experimental report and the experimental levels of the students cannot be comprehensively reflected. In addition, the existing evaluation of the experimental achievement mainly comes from the individual evaluation achievement of the experimental teachers. The strong individual subjectivity of teachers during evaluation leads to the strong individual subjectivity of experimental achievement, so that the experimental truth of the students cannot be reflected without corresponding objective evaluation. On the other hand, because low-value easy-consumption instruments used in the experiment have the defects of large quantity, easy loss, quick damage and low price, the informationization management cannot be realized. When there are many operating personnel in a laboratory to simultaneously work, experimental instruments may be mixed, causing it difficult to distinguish the responsibilities for loss and damage of the experimental instruments. This is especially apparent in the experiment of the students. The students are admitted to the student laboratory to perform the experiment in different periods of time each year. Each laboratory often circularly admits students in multiple classes to perform the experiment. The experimental instruments on an experimental platform are also used jointly by each class. But because basic operating training is mostly conducted by the students and the students are not skilled in experimental operation, the experimental instruments are frequently mixed, lost and damaged. In order not to influence the experiment, the lost and damaged experimental instruments shall be supplemented in time and compensated by responsible persons. However, because there are many experimental instruments with the same specification, it is very difficult to confirm the persons responsible for mixing, loss and damage of the instruments. The existing common management methods are that: 1. The students individually use a set of experimental instruments. When entering the laboratory, the students check and confirm to receive the full set of instruments. After all the experiments are finished, all the instruments are returned to the laboratory. If the instruments are lost or damaged, it will be treated according to the laboratory rule. 2. Many students alternately share one set of experimental instruments. Each student checks and confirms to receive the full set of instruments before the experiment. Instruments lost or damaged shall be reported to the teachers in time for registration and supplementation. After the experiment, the full set of instruments is checked. The instruments lost or damaged shall be reported to the teachers in time for registration and supplementation. After this, the above work is repeated for each experiment. These management methods also have problems in actual operation. For example, after the students finish the experiment, they do not carefully check the experimental instruments and do not find that some instruments are damaged or lost. When the students finish the experiment and check the experimental instruments, the instruments are not damaged and lost, but the instruments are taken away or damaged by other classmates after the students leave the laboratory. Both of the situations will cause that the classmates of the next class find that the experimental instruments are reduced or damaged during check, but the classmates of the previous class believe that they clearly check the instruments at the end of the experiment and consider that the compensation is unreasonable. The solution to this is that the instructors check and confirm each set of experimental instruments for completeness in person at the end of the experiment of each student, which greatly increases the workload of the teachers and the students. These methods belong to manual operation management and have the defects of complicated operation, large labor intensity of the teachers, low management efficiency, serious compensatory hysteresis etc. There are now many computer systems related to laboratory management and assessment of student experiment level. For example: Chinese Invention Patent Application No. 201210161009.1 discloses a comprehensive management system for a laboratory, comprising a computer and comprehensive management software of the laboratory, wherein the comprehensive management software of the laboratory is installed in the computer; the comprehensive management software of the laboratory comprises a portal website construction module, a laboratory information management module, a basic data setting module, a laboratory instrument device management module, a laboratory material consumable management module and a laboratory monitoring module, but the application does not mention how the modules are concretely operated. Chinese Invention Patent Application No. 201010237740.9 provides a remote automatic correcting method for circuital virtual experiment, which comprises: parsing an inputted experimental script of standard answer to obtain a collection of instrument device scoring points and a collection of circuit connection scoring points; selecting needed scoring points from the collection of scoring points, setting a score corresponding to each scoring point, this scoring point will become a scoring rule and a scoring rule library is formed by many scoring rules after the setting is finished; parsing the virtual experiment script to be corrected into an instrument device object and an instrument port object and converting the instrument device object and the instrument port object into factual data; judging whether the factual data is matched with the scoring rules in the scoring rule library, and recording a matching result of each scoring rule in the matching process; and accumulating the scores of the scoring rules successfully matched to obtain the aggregate score in the experiment correction, and outputting the matching results and the score as a school report after correction. The application is applicable to the circuital virtual experiment.

And experiment instructors can observe whether the use of public instruments and taking public reagent operation are correct through monitoring video devices installed in the public instrument operation area and reagent supply area; Experimental instructors can point out students' problems in experiment through the audio output device in the laboratory, and provide problems found in experiment to the central processing module; Through the video monitoring, teachers can timely and appropriately correct students' operation errors during experiment, and evaluate students' operation skills. In addition, the video monitoring can make students do experiment more carefully, and if some instruments are damaged, it can also trace to the responsible person in time. In order to complete this operation evaluation, the position of the experimental operating desk of each student needs to be fixed. When all the students finish filling their experiment position information in a sheet, teachers will count and input the information into the central processing module for recording. Video collecting devices like camera need to be installed in the laboratory, and connected to the central processing module. There are two kinds of video collecting, devices.

The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1, characterized in that: The instrument management module is responsible for the statistics of instrument usage, loss, damage, compensation, and provides related information to the central processing module. The hardware of the instrument management module includes a bar code scanner and experimental instruments with bar codes. The bar code on each experimental instrument is not the same; Before experimental course, students will initially confirm whether the instruments is in good condition, then scan bar codes on the instruments into database, so information that the student is responsible for the instrument is stored into the database. Students scan bar codes on their responsible experiment instruments before each experiment and compared with information in the database in order to confirm experiment instruments are in good condition; If students find instrument instrument is damaged in inspection at the beginning of the experiment, they need to scan damaged instrument bar code and provide it to the central processing module, damaged instruments should be stored into damaged instrument area; an experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to get a new instrument of same type from experimental instrument manager and scan the new bar code to update database; then the experimental instrument manager will identify students who damage the instrument by evidences like experiment arrangement and video monitoring, and inform the related student to compensate by the student interface module. If the students check and find that the experimental instruments that do not belong to their responsible instruments appear in storage positions of their responsible experimental instruments at the beginning of the experiment, they can confirm the responsible students of the experimental instruments through the bar codes on the experimental instruments and return the misplaced experimental instruments to the related students. If the students check and find that some of their responsible experimental instruments are missing at the beginning of the experiment compared with their responsible experimental instruments in the information database, they need to wait for other students to scan the bar codes of the experimental instruments and ask whether they find the missing experimental instruments. If the missing experimental instruments are found, the students get them back; and if the missing experimental instruments are not found, the students should provide the bar code information of the missing instruments to the central processing module. Then an experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to receive a same type new instrument, scan the bar code of the new instrument for registration and update the information database of the student instrument; after that, the experimental instrument manager confirms the students who damage the instrument according to the experimental information like experimental arrangement and the evidence like video monitoring and notifies the students who damage the instrument in the student interface module to do compensation.

If the students damage the experimental instrument and the bar code at the same time, they need to manually input the information related to the instrument, provide the information of the damaged instrument to the central processing module and store the damaged instrument to the damaged instrument area. The experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to get a new instrument of same type, scan the bar code of the new iinstrument for registration and update the information database of the student instrument; after that, the experimental instrument manager confirms the students who damage the instrument and notifies the students who damage the instrument in the student interface module to do compensation.

The instrument management module automatically calculates out the compensation amount of each student as damage of the experimental instruments and sends the compensation amount to the central processing module. The central processing module sends the amount information to be compensated for each student due to damage of the experimental instruments to the student interface module of the students, and meanwhile makes a copy for the experimental instrument manager of the class of the student. Finally, the experimental instrument manager of the class should collect all the compensation fees of the experimental instruments of the whole experimental class and turn over money to experimental instructors. If the damage of the experimental instrument is found by the students themselves and the students actively compensate for them, compensation ratio can be reduced according to the circumstances; and if the damage of the experimental instrument is found by the next experiment classmates, the students who damage the experimental instrument need to pay for them as a high compensation ratio. 7. The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1, characterized in that: The experimental data and image identification module comprises an image collecting device, an image transmission device and image identification software; After reading the original data of the experiment, the students use the image collecting device to shoot an image of the original data of the experiment and then use the image transmission device to transmit the data to the image identification software. The image identification software reads and provides the original data of the experiment in the image by an image identification method to the experimental data processing and analysis module and the central processing module. The original data of the experiment read by the image identification way is compared with students' experimental data and analyzed so as to inspect whether students' original data of the experiment is real and prevent the students from modifying the original data or plagiarizing others' data. The experimental data input interface module receives students' experimental data transmitted by the experimental instrument data communication interface, and then provides the data to the experimental data processing and analysis module and the central processing module. For example, an electronic balance is essentially equipped with an RS232 data communication interface. The experimental data of the students can be directly transmitted from the electronic balance. The experimental data input interface module receives student weighing data transmitted from the data communication interface of the electronic balance and provides the same to the central processing module. 8. The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1, characterized in that: The experimental test sample module comprises a test sample, a test sample information database etc. Each experiment has 2 to 15 test samples which have significant difference in measured quantitative characteristics. Each test sample is made into an independently packed test sample applicable to each student or experimental group, and an information carrier in which feature combined codes are stored is adhered to the test sample or the package of the test sample. The quantitative characteristic value of each test sample and the corresponding feature combined code information are inputted into a sample information database and associated. The students get test samples before the experiment and scan the received carrier in which the feature combined code information is stored on the test samples through a feature combined code information reading device. The feature combined code information reading device sends the scanned feature combined code information of the test samples to the experimental test sample module. After receiving the feature combined code information about the test samples sent by students, the experimental test sample module finds the corresponding measured characteristic of the feature combined code information in the test sample information database, associates the students with the standard values of the measured quantitative characteristics of the received test samples, and then sends the conditions to the experimental data processing and analysis module and the central processing module. The measured characteristics can be some quantitative nature of the test sample to be measured and determined in the experiment, such as chemical property. In an analytical chemistry experiment \u201cDetermination of Molar Mass of Organic Acid\u201d provides two organic acids of different molar masses, i.e., oxalic acid and citric acid. Another example is that in physical chemistry experiment \u201cDetermination of Molecular Weight by Cryoscopic Method\u201d provides two kinds of materials to be tested of different molecular weights, i.e., naphthalene and anthracene. In addition, the measured characteristics can also be such physical property as acoustics, optics, thermotics, magnetics, electrics, etc. These examples are only for bettering understanding, but not for limiting the scope of the measured characteristics. The test samples can be self-made or purchased; whatever the sources are, the measured characteristics of different test samples in the same laboratory shall have significant differences. For example, in the test sample provided in the experiment of \u201cDetermination of Contents of Sodium Carbonate and Sodium Hydroxide in Mixed Alkali\u201d, the mass percentage of the sodium hydroxide and the mass percentage of the sodium carbonate in the mixed alkali test sample of the sodium hydroxide and the sodium carbonate are different. After such test samples are distributed randomly to the students, the students cannot determine their test samples belong to which kind of test samples and cannot know the possible contents of the test samples. Therefore, the students can not plagiarize the data from other students or fabricate the data, so they should determine seriously by themselves. The practice enhances the teaching quality and effect. There is similar practice in laboratories for providing test samples before, but currently the combination of the practice with automatic identification technology has not been reported, 9.

The experimental data processing and analysis module compares the received test sample information provided by the experimental test sample module with the calculation result of the students to evaluate the accurate situation of the test results of the students. The experimental data processing and analysis module integrates the accurate situation of reading the original data by the students and the accurate situation of the test results of the students and forms the entire situation of the experimental data of the students and provides the same to the central processing module. The experimental data processing and analysis module analyzes the accuracy or\/and precision of the students' experimental original data identified in the image identification way, students' experimental data transmitted from the experimental instrument data output interface and the experimental data read by the students themselves in accordance with the data processing and analysis requirements of an experiment teaching material, and provides the accuracy or\/and precision analysis result to the central processing module. The experimental data processing and analysis module needs to perform analysis according to experimental principles and required experimental results of different experiments and can use data processing software such as Excel or self-written program, etc. to form a \u201cdata processor\u201d for processing the experimental data of the students. 10. The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1, characterized in that: The computer written test module of experimental knowledge tests the students about experimental knowledge by the computer exam system, and then provides exam results to the central processing module. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge comprises an objective question examination database of each experimental course that comprises choice questions and true or false questions provided in the laboratory. The students enter the computer written test module of experimental knowledge through the student interface module. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge randomly extracts examination questions from the objective question examination database of the experimental course of the students to form examination paper provided to the examination students. The examination students answer the examination paper. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge receives the answers of the examination students and compares the same with standard answers, and then provides the answering information of the examination students to the central processing module. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge can test the entire mastering condition of the students for the experimental knowledge. The experimental report achievement is reviewed by the teacher. The teacher can give the students fair and reasonable experimental report achievement according to students' preview condition, writing standardized degree, serious degree, etc. with combination of the teacher's teaching experience, and then inputs the achievement into the central processing module.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The application of the present invention provides a concrete embodiment by taking an analytical chemistry laboratory as an example. The chemistry laboratory provides about 700 students of 22 classes majoring in seven-year clinical medicine, five-year clinical medicine, stomatology, inspection, prevention, nursing, etc. in medical college with Basic Chemistry Experimental course and about 90 students of 3 classes majoring in chemistry in Chemical Engineering Institute with the experimental course of Science Analytical Chemistry Experiment in the autumn term in September each year, and provides about 450 students of 15 classes majoring in material, compound material, light chemical engineering, applied chemistry and chemical engineering in Chemical Engineering Institute with the experimental course of Engineering Analytical Chemistry Experiment and provides about 30 students majoring in pharmacy of medical college with Medical Analytical Chemistry Experimental course. The laboratory has three rooms for the experiment for the students (each can accommodate 30 students for the experiment), two balance rooms, one storehouse and one ready room for the experiment. The system for evaluating experimental course achievement of the students of the chemical laboratory comprises an attendance statistic module, a monitoring module, an instrument management module, an experimental data and image identification module, an experimental data input interface module, an experimental test sample module, an experimental data processing and analysis module, an computer written test module of experimental knowledge, a student interface module, a teacher interface module, a central processing module and the like. The central processing module has an interactive interface with the above modules, can obtain information from the above modules and can also send the information stored in the central processing module to each module. Laboratory information like the laboratory name of the chemical laboratory, the laboratory type (i.e., basic chemistry laboratory), room numbers of three laboratories, responsible teachers for the laboratories etc., teacher information like names and posts of responsible teachers for the laboratories, etc., experimental device information like device name, device number, model, specification, device purpose, price, purchase date, manufacturer, laboratory of device, responsible teachers, etc., experimental instrument information like experimental instrument name, instrument bar code, model, specification, price, manufacturer, etc., and data like information of objective question examination base are stored in the system for evaluating experimental course achievement of the students of the chemical laboratory. The achievement information of the students who have finished the experiment is stored in the system for evaluating experimental course achievement of the students. The experimental instruments have bar codes with unique numbers. In other words, each experimental instrument has a bar code different from that of other instruments. The bar codes on the experimental instruments are scanned into an instrument information database. In this way, even for the experimental instruments with the same type and the same specification, each experimental instrument can be accurately distinguished through the difference in the bar codes. The bar codes of glass instruments have the characteristics of acid and akali resistance, organic solvent resistance and high temperature burning resistance. After the experiment is arranged in each term, student information like student names of the experiment, student ID, schools and departments, specialties, etc., and experiment teaching information like experimental project, laboratory name of the experiment, experimental time, name list of experiment students, experiment operating desk positions of the students of the experiment, experimental instructors, etc., are also inputted into the system for evaluating experimental course achievement of the students. The central processing module of the system for evaluating experimental course achievement of the students sends the student information like student names of the experiment, student ID, schools and departments, specialties, etc., and the experiment teaching information like experimental time, name list of experiment students, etc. to the attendance statistic module, sends the student information like student names of the experiment, student ID, schools and departments, specialties, etc., and the experiment teaching information like experimental course name, experimental project, laboratory name of the experiment, experimental time, name list of experiment students, experiment operating desk positions of the students, experimental instructors, etc. to the video monitoring sub-module and the mobile monitoring sub-module, and sends the experimental instrument information like experimental instrument names, bar codes of the instruments, model, specifications, price, manufacturer, etc., the student information like student names of the experiment, student ID, schools and departments, specialties, etc., and the experiment teaching information like experimental course name, experimental project, laboratory name of the experiment, experimental time, name list of experiment students, experiment operating desk positions of the students, experimental instructor, etc. to the instrument management module. The students need to input the feature identification information required by the attendance statistic module before starting the experiment. The attendance statistic module of the system for evaluating experimental course achievement of the students of the laboratory uses a fingerprint identification technology to identify the student identity. A fingerprint scanner of the attendance statistic module first receives the student information like student names of the experiment, student ID, schools and departments, specialties, etc., and the experiment teaching information like experimental time, name list of experiment students, etc. from the central processing module. The students first find out own names, student ID, schools and departments, and specialties in the fingerprint scanner and then input fingerprint in accordance with the instruction of the scanner until the fingerprint scanner prompts a successful input. Before starting the whole experimental course, the students need to confirm that their responsible experimental instruments are intact first, and then scan the bar codes on their responsible experimental instruments into the database. The instrument information database associates the students with their responsible experimental instruments to form responsible experimental instrument information in the instrument information database. The students enter the computer written test module of experimental knowledge through the student interface module. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge randomly extracts examination questions from the objective question examination database comprising choice questions and true or false questions to form examination paper provided to the examination students. The objective question examination database comprising choice questions and true or false questions from which 50 examination questions are randomly extracted to form examination paper provided to the examination students. The examination students answer the examination paper. The computer written test module of experimental knowledge receives the answers of the examination students and compares the same with standard answers, and then provides the answering information of the examination students to the central processing module. Only the qualified students have the qualification to conduct the chemical experiment. At this point, necessary preparation before starting the whole experimental course is finished. The work of preparation of test samples can be finished before starting the whole experimental course or before starting the experiment using the test samples. A label with unique identification code information, having unique number, based on the automatic identification technology is stuck to each test sample. There are at least two test samples with different measured characteristics. Considering from the complexity of preparing the test samples, not more than 15 kinds of samples of different measured characteristics are used. The label with unique identification code information of each test sample and the information of the measured characteristics of each test sample are inputted into the test sample information database of the system for evaluating experimental course achievement of the students. The test samples required in the experiment of Determination of Contents of Sodium Hydroxide and Sodium Carbonate in Mixed Alkali are taken as an example to describe how to prepare the test samples: first, preparing two mixed alkali samples with different contents of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate, wherein 140 g of sodium hydroxide and 160 g of sodium carbonate are respectively weighed and evenly mixed to obtain a test sample 1, and 190 g of sodium hydroxide and 110 g of sodium carbonate are respectively weighed and evenly mixed to obtain a test sample 2; and then determining by the experimental teacher. The result in sample 1: the content of sodium hydroxide is 46.84% and the content of sodium carbonate is 53.16%, and the result in sample 2: the content of sodium hydroxide is 63.41% and the content of sodium carbonate is 36.59%. The above determination results as standard values of the test samples are inputted into the test sample information database. The sample 1 is subpackaged into 1-gram packets to which the labels with unique identification code information and different numbers are stuck randomly. The labels with unique identification code information are scanned into the test sample information database, and the content of sodium hydroxide and the content of sodium carbonate in the packets are also inputted into the test sample information database. Sample 2 is processed in the same way. Then, all the packets of sample 1 and sample 2 are mixed together and stored for standby. The test samples required for other experiments are also prepared in the similar method. Correspondingly, the measured characteristic information and the labels with unique identification code information are also inputted into the test sample information database. Before starting each experiment, the students need to: input fingerprint on the attendance statistic module, receive samples and check experimental instruments. The students first input fingerprint on the fingerprint scanner. The attendance statistic module compares the time of inputting the feature identification information by the students during the experiment with the time required by the experiment to confirm whether the students are late, and then provides the identification result to the central processing module. After that, the students receive randomly distributed test samples, and scan the labels with unique identification code information on the received test samples through a bar code scanner. The bar code scanner sends the scanned identification code information of the test samples to the experimental test sample module. After receiving the identification code information about the test samples sent by students, the experimental test sample module finds the corresponding measured characteristic of the identification code in the test sample information database, and sends the students and the measured characteristics of the received samples to the experimental data processing and analysis module and the central processing module. Then, the students inspect the experimental instruments. If students find the instruments are damaged in inspection, they need to scan the bar code information of the damaged instruments, provide it to the central processing module, and send the damaged instruments into damaged instrument area; an experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to get a new instrument of same type from experimental instrument manager and scan the new bar code to update database; then the experimental instrument manager will identify students who damage the instrument by evidences like experiment arrangement and video monitoring, and inform the related student to compensate by the student interface module. If the students check and find that the experimental instruments that do not belong to their responsible instruments appear in storage positions of their responsible experimental instruments at the beginning of the experiment, they can confirm the responsible students of the experimental instruments through the bar codes on the experimental instruments and return the misplaced experimental instruments to the related students. If the students check and find that some of their responsible experimental instruments are missing at the beginning of the experiment compared with their responsible experimental instruments in the information database, they need to wait for other students to scan the bar codes of the experimental instruments and ask whether they find the missing experimental instruments. If the missing experimental instruments are found, the students get them back; and if the missing experimental instruments are not found, the students should provide the bar code information of the missing instruments to the central processing module. Then an experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to receive a same type new instrument, scan the bar code of the new instrument for registration and update the information database of the student instrument; after that, the experimental instrument manager confirms the students who damage the instrument according to the experimental information like experimental arrangement and the evidence like video monitoring and notifies the students who damage the instrument in the student interface module to do compensation. After preparation is finished before each experiment, the students start the experiment. In the process of the experiment, the instructors use the video monitoring sub-module and the mobile monitoring sub-module to supervise, inspect, evaluate and record students' operation, discipline, sanitation, etc. The video monitoring sub-module comprises an audio and video collecting device and an audio output device installed in the laboratory, a video display device and an audio input and output device installed in the monitoring room and corresponding software. The experimental instructors observe student experimental operating situation through the video display device in the monitoring room, and correct students' improper operation in time. The experimental instructors can find whether the students violate provisions of the laboratory through the video collecting device used for observing laboratory overall situation. Through the video collecting device installed on room wall or ceiling of the experimental platform or crossed platform extension lines, the experimental instructors can observe whether the students' operation is correct. The experimental instructors can observe whether the operation of the students is correct through the video collecting devices installed in a public instrument operation region and a public reagent taking region where the operation of the students can be monitored. The experimental instructors can prevent students' problems in the experiment through the audio output device in the laboratory and correct students' misoperation. When the students have improper operation in the process of the experiment, such as experimental operation errors, experimental instrument misuse, etc., the teachers can intercept the screen and store a photograph for standby, then inquire the student information in the position in the central processing module, provide students' problems in the experiment to the central processing module and record the experimental operation evaluation. In addition, through video monitoring, the students can conduct the experiment more carefully. In order to complete the video monitoring, the position of the experimental operating desk of each student needs to be fixed. When all the students finish filling their experiment position information in a sheet, teachers will count and input the information into the central processing module for recording. If some experimental instruments are damaged, it can also trace to the responsible person in time. Because the operation video of each experiment can be recorded, it is convenient to confirm the damage condition of common experimental instruments. If the students who damage the common experimental instruments do not admit that, the monitoring video can be invoked as an evidence. There are two kinds of video collecting devices. One is used to observe the laboratory overall situation, mainly for observing whether violations of laboratory provisions exist in the laboratory. The other is installed in the position where student operation can be observed, mainly used for observing whether the student operation is correct. For this kind of camera, it can be installed on room wall or ceiling of the experimental platform or crossed platform extension lines for monitoring the operation of this row of students or installed in a public instrument operation region and a public reagent taking region for monitoring the operation of the students in the public region. The balance room of the chemical laboratory has two rows of balances. A camera is arranged above the room wall or ceiling of crossed extension lines on both sides of each row of balances for observing student operation of the balances, and a camera which observes the complete picture of the balance room as much as possible is also arranged. Six experimental platforms are arranged in the room used for the students to conduct the experiment. Each column of experimental platforms has five experimental operation positions where five students can conduct the experiment. The camera is arranged above the room wall or ceiling of crossed extension lines on both sides of each column of experimental platforms, used for observing the experimental operation of the students. The room used for the students to conduct the experiment has a table balance region for weighing solid reagents and one camera used for observing the balance weighing operation of the students. A fume cupboard used for weighing liquid reagents is arranged in the room used for the students to conduct the experiment. A camera is arranged in the fume cupboard and used for observing the weighing operation of the liquid reagents of the students. A column of side platforms is also arranged in the room used for the students to conduct the experiment and devices like pneumatic dryer are arranged above. A camera is arranged on the room wall or ceiling of crossed extension lines on both sides of the platforms and used for observing related experimental operation of the students. Three water tanks arranged in a straight line are also arranged in the room used for the students to conduct the experiment and have water supply and sewer used for cleaning the experimental instruments. A camera is arranged on the room wall or ceiling of crossed extension lines on both sides of the water tanks and used for observing student operation of cleaning the experimental instruments. The video monitoring sub-module can store videos shot by the cameras for a period of time, and has inquiry functions like playback and evidence fixing function like image interception. The mobile monitoring sub-module is installed in the smart phone, storing lab name, experimental course name, experimental project, experimental time, student name and ID according to major and class, experimental instructors and other information; and options like types of student operation error and types of violations of laboratory provisions are arranged in the mobile monitoring sub-module. When the experimental instructors find students' operation errors or violations of laboratory provisions during patrol in the laboratory through the smart phone provided with the mobile monitoring sub-module carried by the experimental instructors, student's name and ID are confirmed in the mobile monitoring sub-module at first, and then corresponding options like types of student operation error and types of violations of laboratory provisions are chose to identify. Finally, the mobile monitoring sub-module provides the identification of types of student operation error and types of violations of laboratory provisions to the central processing module by wireless way. The experimental instructors can also use the mobile monitoring sub module to take a photograph for misoperation of the students and send the photograph into a CPU as an evidence. Then, the teachers remind and help the students to correct misoperation of the experiment and confirm student's name and ID, and then, choose corresponding options like types of student operation error and types of violations of laboratory provisions to identify. Finally, the mobile monitoring sub-module provides the identification of types of student operation error and types of violations of laboratory provisions to the central processing module by wireless way. After reading the original data of the experiment, the students use the image collecting device to shoot an image of the original data of the experiment and then use the image transmission device to transmit the data to the image identification software. The image identification software reads and provides the original data of the experiment in the image by an image identification method to the experimental data processing and analysis module and the central processing module. For example, after titration, a titration level is shot and sent to the mage identification software for identifying the position of a scale line and reading titration volume. The original data of the experiment read by the image identification way is compared with students' experimental data and analyzed so as to inspect whether students' original data of the experiment is real and prevent the students from modifying the original data or plagiarizing others' data. When the students use an instrument with a data communication interface capable of transmitting the determination data into the computer, the experimental data input interface module receives students' experimental data transmitted by the experimental instrument data communication interface, and then provides the data to the experimental data processing and analysis module and the central processing module. For example, an electronic balance is essentially equipped with an RS232 data communication interface. After a substance is weighed by the students, the experimental data of weighing the mass can be directly transmitted from the electronic balance. The experimental data input interface module receives student weighing data transmitted from the data communication interface of the electronic balance and provides the same to the central processing module. After the students finish the experiment, they need to clean the experimental instruments and put their responsible experimental instruments on normal storing areas, and scan the bar codes again in order to confirm that their responsible experimental instruments are not missing and misplaced. At the end of the experiment, the students need to clean the laboratory and clean the experimental platform surfaces used by individual experiments. The intructors shall sign on the original experimental data of the students and after that, the students need to scan the fingerprint in the fingerprint scanner again to confirm the time of leaving the laboratory. Students on duty are responsible for cleaning public regions and arranging experimental instruments and reagents, and also need to inspect and confirm whether common instruments are intact or not. If some instruments are damaged, it shall be reported to the teachers in time for processing. If the responsible person can be found through the video monitoring system, the responsible person makes compensation; otherwise, the whole class makes compensation collectively. After the above work is finished, the instructors carry the mobile monitoring sub-module to inspect the cleaning condition of the students and make corresponding identification according to different conditions. Students can input experimental data read by the students themselves and their processed results through the student interface module, and need to autonomously input the data after the experiment. After the experiment, students can enter the data input interface of the data analysis system and input corresponding original data into the input interface. The data is automatically stored and transmitted to the central processing module. Students can browse related experimental information like their experimental achievement, deduction, instrument compensation, etc. through the student interface module, and class management personnel such as monitor can browse and manage cleaning duties, laboratory discipline, instruments compensation and other related information of the class. At the end of the course, the class management personnel collect all the compensation payments for damaged instruments of all the students in the class and give the experimental instructors. At the end of the students' experiment, corresponding data processing shall be made to form an experimental result for writing an experimental report. In the next experiment, experimental reports are collected by a subject representative and given to the teacher. The teacher gives the students corresponding experimental report scores according to such standards as integrity of the experimental reports of the students. The experimental report achievement reviewed by the experimental instructor is provided to the central processing module through the teacher interface module. The attendance statistic module of the students detects the fingerprint of designated fingers on the fingerprint scanner before and after each experiment of the students and sends the detection information about the student fingerprint to the central processing module. The central processing module receives student fingerprint information, checks the identity information of the students, and also records the time of initial fingerprint detection of the students. In fingerprint scanning, the central processing module can be connected on-line for information check. Alternatively, the fingerprint is stored off-line, and then data is exported through a USB interface and stored into the central processing module of a terminal. In fingerprint identification after the experiment, the fingerprint detection time shall be recorded again while checking the above information, and a differencing operation is made between the fingerprint detection time and the initial detection time for recording the experimental time of the students. If students have no attendance time twice, they are regarded as absence from duty; if the initial fingerprint identification time of the students is later than school time, the students are regarded as lateness; and if the second fingerprint identification time is earlier than class-over time, the students are regarded as early leaving. The experimental data processing and analysis module receives students' experimental original data identified in an image identification way, students' experimental data transmitted from the experimental instrument data output interface, the test sample information provided by the experimental test sample module, experimental data read by the students themselves and calculating results. The experimental data processing and analysis module compares the received students' experimental original data identified in the image identification way, students' experimental data transmitted from the experimental instrument data output interface and the experimental data read by the students themselves to evaluate the accurate situation of reading the original data by the students. The experimental data processing and analysis module compares the received test sample information provided by the experimental test sample module with the calculation result of the students to evaluate the accurate situation of the test results of the students. The experimental data processing and analysis module integrates the accurate situation of reading the original data by the students and the accurate situation of the test results of the students and forms the entire situation of the experimental data of the students and provides the same to the central processing module. The experimental data processing and analysis module analyzes the accuracy or\/and precision of the students' experimental original data identified in the image identification way, students' experimental data transmitted from the experimental instrument data output interface and the experimental data read by the students themselves in accordance with the data processing and analysis requirements of an experiment teaching material, and provides the accuracy or\/and precision analysis result to the central processing module. The central processing module converts the received attendance information of experimental students, students' experimental situations found by the video monitoring sub-module, students' related situations found by the mobile monitoring sub-module during patrol, experimental instrument related situations, the overall situation of students' experimental data, students experimental knowledge test achievement and experimental report results reviewed by the experimental instructors into the corresponding attendance achievement, video achievement, patrol achievement, instrument achievement, data achievement, examination achievement and report achievement in accordance with pre-established criteria. In the analytical chemistry laboratory, each experiment has a full score of 100, wherein attendance achievement, video achievement, patrol achievement, instrument achievement, data achievement and report achievement respectively have weights of 10 scores, 10 scores, 10 scores, 10 scores, 40 scores and 20 scores. 5 scores are deducted for lateness and early leaving; 10 scores are deducted for absenteeism and lateness for more than 10 minutes and penalty run is needed; 2 scores are deducted for each experimental operation error: 2 scores are deducted for each violation of laboratory discipline; 3 scores are deducted for each damaged or missing experimental instrument; and the data achievement calculated and given by the program is between 30 scores and 40 scores. The types of the experimental operation errors include the operation errors of common experimental instruments like balances, piettes, volumetric flasks, burettes, measuring cylinders, etc. For example, the weighing of the analytical balance comprises the key operation steps of inspecting the balance level, adjusting the balance zero, closing the balance door at any time, horizontally opening the dryer, taking a strip of paper out of a weighing bottle, placing the weighing bottle in the center of the tray, knocking the upper edge of the weighing bottle, raising the weighing bottle while knocking, ensuring that drugs have no leakage and surplus, returning the weighing bottle to the dryer, returning the balance to zero, recovering excessive samples, putting the strip of paper into a dustbin, not changing a data record, etc. Violations of the above operation requirements will be regarded as experimental operation errors and deduction will be made. Types of violations of experimental discipline include behavior errors, which endanger laboratory safety and influence laboratory sanitation, like slapstick, eating, speaking loudly, littering, etc. in the laboratory. The experimental instructors add the experimental achievement of each experiment and the examination achievement in accordance with certain weights to obtain the final experimental achievement of the students, and submit the same to an educational administration system of the school for incorporation in students' achievement file.

Finally, the mobile monitoring sub-module provides the identification of types of student operation error and types of violations of laboratory provisions to the central processing module by wireless way. After laboratory cleaning, experimental instructors check sanitation situation and deduct marks for those students on duty who fail to meet cleaning requirements, and then provide related information to the central processing module. 6. The system and method for evaluating experiment teaching achievement based on automatic identification technology according to claim 1, characterized in that: The instrument management module is responsible for the statistics of instrument usage, loss, damage, compensation, and provides related information to the central processing module. The hardware of the instrument management module includes a bar code scanner and experimental instruments with bar codes. The bar code on each experimental instrument is not the same; Before experimental course, students will initially confirm whether the instruments is in good condition, then scan bar codes on the instruments into database, so information that the student is responsible for the instrument is stored into the database. Students scan bar codes on their responsible experiment instruments before each experiment and compared with information in the database in order to confirm experiment instruments are in good condition; If students find instrument is damaged in inspection at the beginning of the experiment, they need to scan damaged instrument bar code and provide it to the central processing module, damaged instruments should be stored into damaged instrument area; an experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to get a new instrument of same type from experimental instrument manager and scan the new bar code to update database; then the experimental instrument manager will identify students who damage the instrument by evidences like experiment arrangement and video monitoring, and inform the related student to compensate by the student interface module. If the students check and find that the experimental instruments that do not belong to their responsible instruments appear in storage positions of their responsible experimental instruments at the beginning of the experiment, they can confirm the responsible students of the experimental instruments through the bar codes on the experimental instruments and return the misplaced experimental struments to the related students. If the students check and find that some of their responsible experimental instruments are missing at the beginning of the experiment compared with their responsible experimental instruments in the information database, they need to wait for other students to scan the bar codes of the experimental instruments and ask whether they find the missing experimental instruments. If the missing experimental instruments are found, the students get them back; and if the missing experimental instruments are not found, the students should provide the bar code information of the missing instruments to the central processing module. Then an experimental instrument manager will open the storage position of a new instrument and lead the students to receive a same type new instrument, scan the bar code of the new instrument for registration and update the information database of the student instrument; after that, the experimental instrument manager confirms the students who damage the instrument according to the experimental information like expenmental arrangement and the evidence like video monitoring and notifies the students who damage the instrument in the student interface module to do compensation.

The instrument management module automatically calculates out the compensation amount of each student as damage of the experimental instruments and sends the compensation amount to the central processing module. The central processing module sends the amount information to be compensated for each student due to damage of the experimental instruments to the student interface module of the students, and meanwhile makes a copy for the experimental instrument manager of the class of the student.

Technical Field This disclosure relates to charge accumulators such as batteries and capacitors, in particular to high capacity multiple cell batteries. More particular this disclosure relates to multiple cell batteries with improved stability to increase capacity of individual cells. 2. Background U. S. Patent Application Publication 2010\/0175245 Do, et al. illustrates an exemplary stacking structure a lithium ion battery. FIGS. 1 a -1 d illustrates the structure of an anode of a lithium ion battery cell of Do, et al. FIGS. 2 a -2 d illustrates the structure of a cathode of a lithium ion battery cell of Do, et al. FIG. 3 illustrates the organization of multiple current collectors that are commonly referred to as anodes and cathodes to form a lithium ion battery of Do, et al. In FIGS. 1 a -1 d , an anode 100 is formed of a metal film 120 such as copper and is coated with an active anode material 110 on both sides of the metal film 120 cut to predetermined dimensions. The active anode material 110 material is typically graphite or carbon that is coated in the form of slurry, and dried. The active anode material 110 does not coat the entire surface area of the metal film 120 . An adhesive 130 is placed on an edge portion that is not coated with the active anode material 110 on one side of the anode 100 . The adhesive 130 is a material such as glue, starch, an adhesive tape, or other adhesive means. The side of the anode 100 having adhesive material 130 is adhered to a separator 300 . The separator 300 is generally a macroporous film of polyethylene or polypropylene. In FIGS. 2 a -2 d , a cathode 200 is formed of a metal film 220 such as aluminum and is coated with an active cathode material 210 on both sides of the metal film 220 cut to predetermined dimensions. The active cathode material 210 is typically Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO 2 ), Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO 4 ), or other similar reactive material. The active cathode material 210 does not coat the entire surface area of the metal film 220 . An adhesive 230 is placed on an edge portion that is not coated with the active cathode material 210 on one side of the anode 200 . The adhesive 230 is a material such as glue or starch, an adhesive tape, or other adhesive means. The side of the cathode 200 having adhesive material 230 is adhered to a separator 300 . In FIG. 3 , the anodes 100 attached to a separator 300 , the cathodes 200 attached to a separator 300 , an unattached anode 100 have an adhesive placed at the remaining edge portion not coated with the active anode material 110 or active cathode material 210 . The unattached anode 100 is placed at a bottom of the stack and the cathodes 200 attached to the separators 300 are stacked alternately with the anodes 100 attached to the separators 300 in an interleaved fashion. The stack is then compressed to adhere the adhesives to an opposite side of the separator 300 placed above the electrode (anode 100 or cathode 200 ). The compressed stack 400 is then placed in a shell (not shown) and an electrolyte solution is placed in the shell to immerse the anodes 100 and the cathodes 200 . The electrolyte solution is a mixture of a solute (as ion source) dissolved in organic solvent. In lithium ion batteries, propylene carbonate or ethylene carbonate may be used as the organic solvent and lithium phosphate as the solute. In some implementations, each electrode (anode 100 and cathodes 200 ) is a sheet of electrically conductive current collector, such as copper film in the anodes 100 , and aluminum film in the cathodes 200 . Except for the top and bottom sheets in the stack, each electrode 100 , 200 is coated on both sides with electrochemically active material, such as graphite in the anodes 100 and lithium metal oxide in the cathodes 200 . The top and bottom surfaces of the stack do not require coating, because these two surfaces are not facing electrodes 100 , 200 of opposite polarity and do not participate in the electrochemical reaction. Internal shorts between the electrodes 100 and 200 of a cell of a battery may be caused by burrs on the current collector (the aluminum or copper foil on which the electrochemically active material is coated). In particular, aluminum burrs may penetrate the separator and contact the graphite to cause thermal runaway. The contact resistance closely matches the internal resistance (output resistance) of a lithium-ion cell for portable electronics. Another cause of the internal shorts is mossy lithium dendritic growth on the anode surface may penetrate the separator. Since the dendrite will contact lithium metal oxide cathode coating, which is not very conductive, the hazard of thermal runaway is lower than aluminum burrs. It takes a very large mossy lithium dendrite to initiate thermal runaway. Foreign particles such as conductive metal chips present in incoming material (for example steel wear debris in the cathode powders, or falling burrs from the steel cans), or entering the cell during assembly process (for example wear debris in the conveyer) may migrate into the cathode\/anode interface. Also, metal particles formed during charging\/discharging cycles by galvanic process and can thus breach the separator to cause shorts. External forces such as bending and impact on the cell may cause electrodes to break. Exposed current collectors (Cu or Al foils) may penetrate the separator to cause shorts. Manufacturing defect such as a defective separator or folding separator during the stacking\/winding (assembly) process may leave the positive and negative electrodes in contact over the defect zone. Usually, internal short involves only one interface. In a conventional cell, all positive\/negative electrode interfaces are hard wired together. Thus the short draws current from all interfaces. In the present disclosure, the interfaces are partitioned into two groups that may be separated completely or through a buffer resistor. Thus only half of the interfaces are contributing to the short current. Considering that the heat generated at the short spot is proportional to the square of current, this disclosure effectively cuts down the hot spot heat generation by a factor of four. When an inadvertent electrical short circuit occurs within a cell, the resistance of the short circuit connection causes overheating in the electrode and the separator. The temperature at the short circuit region may be sufficiently high to trigger thermal runaway that will lead to fire and explosion. For any given cell, the short circuit connection generates maximum amount of heat when its resistance equals the cell's output resistance. However at any given short circuit, heat generation increases monotonically with decreasing output resistance of the cell. Since the output resistance is approximately inversely proportional to the cell capacity, heat generation at any given short increases monotonically with the cell capacity. The electrical short circuiting of the electrodes is often referred to as a \u201cdead short\u201d, i.e., bare metal contacts with negligible resistance. In this case, the short circuit current is proportional to the cell capacity. By Joule's law, heat generation at the short is proportional to the short circuit current squared, hence the square of cell capacity. A dead short circuit in a high capacity cell or battery can generate enough heat to induce thermal runaway around the short circuit location within the electrodes, even if the short circuit is very brief (e.g., the contact may burn out or melt down). Thus the threshold of cell capacity must be observed very strictly. Thermal runaway occurs when heat released in a short circuit region through exothermal chemical reaction exceeds heat dissipation capability from the short circuit region. Thus cooling is an effective way for the prevention of the exothermic reaction to cause the thermal runaway. Experience has shown that thermal runaway occurs much more readily at elevated temperature than at room temperature. Furthermore, cooling by conduction is known to reduce the occurrence of thermal runaway. For example, a short at the corner of an electrode is more likely to cause thermal runaway than a short at the center of the electrode. This is because a short circuit at a corner is connected to electrodes in only one quadrant, where as a short at the center is surrounded by electrodes in all four quadrants. A short at the center has four times as much heat sink as a short at a corner. A larger cell does not necessarily serve as a better heat sink to a short, because the thermal runaway may begin rapidly in a small region, especially during a dead short. There is no significant heat dissipation outward. Thus it does not matter how large the cell is, as far as heat sink is concerned. Cell output resistance remains as the dominant factor in the initiation of thermal runaway. Unfortunately, the battery output resistance is getting lower and lower to meet the power requirement of modern portable electronics. In order to prevent thermal runaway, a common practice is to partition the battery into a plurality of low capacity battery cell types. Presently two or three cells are connected in parallel in popular tablet computers such as Apple iPad\u2122. Merging two battery cell types into one may result in 12% to 19% increase in capacity, and 15% cost reduction. However such cost reduction and capacity gain cannot be realized, lest the capacity of such merged cell may exceed the safety threshold. There is an acute need to raise the safety threshold. Modest cost reduction can also be achieved by encasing multiple cells into a single shell. Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), Tsuen Wan, N. T., Hong Kong (Assignee of the present disclosure) has been shipping such shell-sharing cells since 2008. For example, each 20Ah battery cell consists of a single stainless steel case, with two shell-less cells (commonly known as \u201cjellyrolls\u201d) stacked together, and connected internally in parallel. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/694,144 (Ramesh et al.) provides a battery pouch holding multiple jellyrolls side-by-side. The multiple jellyrolls are connected outside of the pouch. Heat transfer between multiple jellyrolls is ineffective in ATL's stacking arrangement, and negligible in Ramesh's side-by-side layout.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An object of this disclosure is to provide a battery having the electrodes of multiple battery cell types interleaved to prevent thermal runaway. Another object of this disclosure is to provide a battery having multiple merged battery cell types structured to prevent thermal runaway by cooling a shorted region within between electrodes. To accomplish at least one of these objects, a battery includes multiple electrodes of any number of battery cell types of a first polarity. The electrodes of each of the battery cell types share a pair of the common electrodes having a second polarity. The electrodes of the multiple battery cell types and the multiple common electrodes are interleaved such that the stack effectively includes multiple electrically independent cells. These multiple electrically independent cells are merged into a single stack, and will share a common shell or pouch. The merged cells may be connected either externally (i.e., outside of the shell) or internally (i.e., within the shell) in parallel. However external connection is generally preferred for two reasons. First, each of the two merged cells may be tested independently during manufacturing and secondly, the external connection provides flexibility in the selection of an inrush current limiter (e.g., a buffer resistor, a re-settable fuse, or a positive thermal coefficient element). Further, this provides convenience in service. A typical internal short involves only one of the multiple merged cells. With a suitable inrush current limiter, if the electrodes of the multiple battery cell types and the adjacent common electrodes of one or more battery cell types short together, the current within the shorted battery cells is sufficiently small to prevent thermal runaway and the electrodes of the adjacent battery cells of the other battery cell types of the first polarity and the common electrodes of the second polarity not having short circuits provide heat sinking for the heat generated by the short circuit to further prevent thermal runaway. In some embodiments, the common electrodes are coupled to first connective tabs at a first common location at one edge of the electrodes and the electrodes of the first polarity are coupled to connective tabs common at locations such that each battery cell of the plurality of battery cell types has a unique connective tab location for the electrodes of the first polarity that is separate from the connective tab locations of the connective tab locations of the all other battery cell types. In other embodiments, the electrodes of the first polarity for one battery cell type are coupled to multiple connective tabs and the multiple connective tabs are located such that at least a second battery cell type is created by rotating the surfaces of the one battery cell type to shift the location of the multiple connective tabs. In still other embodiments, the common electrodes are coupled to connective tabs on one edge of the common electrodes and the electrodes of the first polarity of at least one battery cell type are coupled to connective tabs at an opposing edge. The connective tabs located such that at least a second battery cell type is created by rotating the surfaces of the electrodes of the first polarity of the first battery cell type. In various embodiments, the interleaved electrodes of the first polarity of each battery cell type and the common electrodes are placed in a shell or pouch. An electrolyte is placed in the shell or pouch to immerse the battery cells. The shell or pouch is sealed with the connective tabs for the electrode of the first polarity of each battery cell type connected to a terminal for the first polarity and the connective tabs for the common electrodes connected to a common terminal. In some embodiments, the electrodes of the first polarity have a differing chemistry between the battery cell types. In various embodiments, the merged battery cell types are connected in a series configuration. In other embodiments, the merged battery cell types are connected in a parallel configuration. In still other embodiments, the merged battery cell types are connected in a series-parallel configuration. In various embodiments, the merged battery cell types are protected by a current limiting device such as a fuse, a thermal cut-off device, a positive thermal coefficient device, a metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), or other device or circuitry capable of restricting the excess current flow through the battery cells in an over-current event. In various embodiments, at least one of the objects is accomplished with a method for forming a battery having multiple merged battery cell types structured to prevent thermal runaway by cooling a shorted region within between electrodes. A plurality of battery cell types is formed with each battery cell type having multiple electrodes of a first polarity. Each electrode of each of the plurality of battery cell types is formed with a connection tab placed at a unique location. Multiple common electrodes of a second polarity are formed with each electrode having a connection tab placed at another unique location. The electrodes of each of the plurality of battery cell types and common electrodes are formed of a metal film adhered to a separator. The metal film, in some embodiments, is aluminum and in other embodiments, is copper. The metal film in the interior of the battery is coated on both sides with an electrochemically active material. The metal film situated at each end of the electrode stack has the electrochemically active material placed on one surface facing toward the interior of the battery. In some embodiments, the electrochemically active material of the anode is graphite and the electrochemically active material of the cathode is lithium metal oxide. The electrodes of each of the plurality of battery cell types are interleaved with a common electrode placed between each of the electrodes of each of the plurality of battery cell types. The connection tabs of the electrodes of each of the plurality of battery cell types are connected together. The connection tabs of each of the common electrodes are connected together. The interleaved stack of the electrodes is then compressed and placed in a containment shell. The containment shell may be a metal shell such as stainless steel or a non-reactive plastic. In other embodiments, the interleaved stack of electrodes is placed in a plastic pouch that is sealed. The containment shell or the pouch is filled with an electrolyte to immerse the electrodes.","description":"The present invention is a divisional application that claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120 from U.S. patent application Ser.

In lithium ion batteries, propylene carbonate or ethylene carbonate may be used as the organic solvent and lithium phosphate as the solute. In some implementations, each electrode (anode 100 and cathodes 200) is a sheet of electrically conductive current collector, such as copper film in the anodes 100, and aluminum film in the cathodes 200. Except for the top and bottom sheets in the stack, each electrode 100, 200 is coated on both sides with electrochemically active material, such as graphite in the anodes 100 and lithium metal oxide in the cathodes 200. The top and bottom surfaces of the stack do not require coating, because these two surfaces are not facing electrodes 100, 200 of opposite polarity and do not participate in the electrochemical reaction. Internal shorts between the electrodes 100 and 200 of a cell of a battery may be caused by burrs on the current collector (the aluminum or copper foil on which the electrochemically active material is coated). In particular, aluminum burrs may penetrate the separator and contact the graphite to cause thermal runaway. The contact resistance closely matches the internal resistance (output resistance) of a lithium-ion cell for portable electronics. Another cause of the internal shorts is mossy lithium dendritic growth on the anode surface may penetrate the separator. Since the dendrite will contact lithium metal oxide cathode coating, which is not very conductive, the hazard of thermal runaway is lower than aluminum burrs. It takes a very large mossy lithium dendrite to initiate thermal runaway. Foreign particles such as conductive metal chips present in incoming material (for example steel wear debris in the cathode powders, or falling burrs from the steel cans), or entering the cell during assembly process (for example wear debris in the conveyer) may migrate into the cathode\/anode interface. Also, metal particles formed during charging\/discharging cycles by galvanic process and can thus breach the separator to cause shorts. External forces such as bending and impact on the cell may cause electrodes to break. Exposed current collectors (Cu or Al foils) may penetrate the separator to cause shorts. Manufacturing defect such as a defective separator or folding separator during the stacking\/winding (assembly) process may leave the positive and negative electrodes in contact over the defect zone. Usually, internal short involves only one interface. In a conventional cell, all positive\/negative electrode interfaces are hard wired together. Thus the short draws current from all interfaces. In the present disclosure, the interfaces are partitioned into two groups that may be separated completely or through a buffer resistor. Thus only half of the interfaces are contributing to the short current. Considering that the heat generated at the short spot is proportional to the square of current, this disclosure effectively cuts down the hot spot heat generation by a factor of four. When an inadvertent electrical short circuit occurs within a cell, the resistance of the short circuit connection causes overheating in the electrode and the separator. The temperature at the short circuit region may be sufficiently high to trigger thermal runaway that will lead to fire and explosion. For any given cell, the short circuit connection generates maximum amount of heat when its resistance equals the cell's output resistance. However at any given short circuit, heat generation increases monotonically with decreasing output resistance of the cell. Since the output resistance is approximately inversely proportional to the cell capacity, heat generation at any given short increases monotonically with the cell capacity. The electrical short circuiting of the electrodes is often referred to as a \u201cdead short\u201d, i.e., bare metal contacts with negligible resistance. In this case, the short circuit current is proportional to the cell capacity. By Joule's law, heat generation at the short is proportional to the short circuit current squared, hence the square of cell capacity. A dead short circuit in a high capacity cell or battery can generate enough heat to induce thermal runaway around the short circuit location within the electrodes, even if the short circuit is very brief (e.g., the contact may burn out or melt down). Thus the threshold of cell capacity must be observed very strictly. Thermal runaway occurs when heat released in a short circuit region through exothermal chemical reaction exceeds heat dissipation capability from the short circuit region. Thus cooling is an effective way for the prevention of the exothermic reaction to cause the thermal runaway. Experience has shown that thermal runaway occurs much more readily at elevated temperature than at room temperature. Furthermore, cooling by conduction is known to reduce the occurrence of thermal runaway. For example, a short at the corner of an electrode is more likely to cause thermal runaway than a short at the center of the electrode. This is because a short circuit at a corner is connected to electrodes in only one quadrant, where as a short at the center is surrounded by electrodes in all four quadrants. A short at the center has four times as much heat sink as a short at a corner. A larger cell does not necessarily serve as a better heat sink to a short, because the thermal runaway may begin rapidly in a small region, especially during a dead short. There is no significant heat dissipation outward. Thus it does not matter how large the cell is, as far as heat sink is concerned. Cell output resistance remains as the dominant factor in the initiation of thermal runaway. Unfortunately, the battery output resistance is getting lower and lower to meet the power requirement of modern portable electronics. In order to prevent thermal runaway, a common practice is to partition the battery into a plurality of low capacity battery cell types. Presently two or three cells are connected in parallel in popular tablet computers such as Apple iPad\u2122. Merging two battery cell types into one may result in 12% to 19% increase in capacity, and 15% cost reduction. However such cost reduction and capacity gain cannot be realized, lest the capacity of such merged cell may exceed the safety threshold. There is an acute need to raise the safety threshold. Modest cost reduction can also be achieved by encasing multiple cells into a single shell. Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), Tsuen Wan, N. T., Hong Kong (Assignee of the present disclosure) has been shipping such shell-sharing cells since 2008. For example, each 20Ah battery cell consists of a single stainless steel case, with two shell-less cells (commonly known as \u201cjellyrolls\u201d) stacked together, and connected internally in parallel. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/694,144 (Ramesh et al.) provides a battery pouch holding multiple jellyrolls side-by-side. The multiple jellyrolls are connected outside of the pouch. Heat transfer between multiple jellyrolls is ineffective in ATL's stacking arrangement, and negligible in Ramesh's side-by-side layout. SUMMARY An object of this disclosure is to provide a battery having the electrodes of multiple battery cell types interleaved to prevent thermal runaway. Another object of this disclosure is to provide a battery having multiple merged battery cell types structured to prevent thermal runaway by cooling a shorted region within between electrodes. To accomplish at least one of these objects, a battery includes multiple electrodes of any number of battery cell types of a first polarity. The electrodes of each of the battery cell types share a pair of the common electrodes having a second polarity. The electrodes of the multiple battery cell types and the multiple common electrodes are interleaved such that the stack effectively includes multiple electrically independent cells. These multiple electrically independent cells are merged into a single stack, and will share a common shell or pouch. The merged cells may be connected either externally (i.e., outside of the shell) or internally (i.e., within the shell) in parallel. However external connection is generally preferred for two reasons. First, each of the two merged cells may be tested independently during manufacturing and secondly, the external connection provides flexibility in the selection of an inrush current limiter (e.g., a buffer resistor, a re-settable fuse, or a positive thermal coefficient element). Further, this provides convenience in service. A typical internal short involves only one of the multiple merged cells. With a suitable inrush current limiter, if the electrodes of the multiple battery cell types and the adjacent common electrodes of one or more battery cell types short together, the current within the shorted battery cells is sufficiently small to prevent thermal runaway and the electrodes of the adjacent battery cells of the other battery cell types of the first polarity and the common electrodes of the second polarity not having short circuits provide heat sinking for the heat generated by the short circuit to further prevent thermal runaway. In some embodiments, the common electrodes are coupled to first connective tabs at a first common location at one edge of the electrodes and the electrodes of the first polarity are coupled to connective tabs common at locations such that each battery cell of the plurality of battery cell types has a unique connective tab location for the electrodes of the first polarity that is separate from the connective tab locations of the connective tab locations of the all other battery cell types. In other embodiments, the electrodes of the first polarity for one battery cell type are coupled to multiple connective tabs and the multiple connective tabs are located such that at least a second battery cell type is created by rotating the surfaces of the one battery cell type to shift the location of the multiple connective tabs. In still other embodiments, the common electrodes are coupled to connective tabs on one edge of the common electrodes and the electrodes of the first polarity of at least one battery cell type are coupled to connective tabs at an opposing edge. The connective tabs located such that at least a second battery cell type is created by rotating the surfaces of the electrodes of the first polarity of the first battery cell type. In various embodiments, the interleaved electrodes of the first polarity of each battery cell type and the common electrodes are placed in a shell or pouch. An electrolyte is placed in the shell or pouch to immerse the battery cells. The shell or pouch is sealed with the connective tabs for the electrode of the first polarity of each battery cell type connected to a terminal for the first polarity and the connective tabs for the common electrodes connected to a common terminal. In some embodiments, the electrodes of the first polarity have a differing chemistry between the battery cell types. In various embodiments, the merged battery cell types are connected in a series configuration. In other embodiments, the merged battery cell types are connected in a parallel configuration. In still other embodiments, the merged battery cell types are connected in a series-parallel configuration. In various embodiments, the merged battery cell types are protected by a current limiting device such as a fuse, a thermal cut-off device, a positive thermal coefficient device, a metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), or other device or circuitry capable of restricting the excess current flow through the battery cells in an over-current event. In various embodiments, at least one of the objects is accomplished with a method for forming a battery having multiple merged battery cell types structured to prevent thermal runaway by cooling a shorted region within between electrodes. A plurality of battery cell types is formed with each battery cell type having multiple electrodes of a first polarity. Each electrode of each of the plurality of battery cell types is formed with a connection tab placed at a unique location. Multiple common electrodes of a second polarity are formed with each electrode having a connection tab placed at another unique location. The electrodes of each of the plurality of battery cell types and common electrodes are formed of a metal film adhered to a separator. The metal film, in some embodiments, is aluminum and in other embodiments, is copper. The metal film in the interior of the battery is coated on both sides with an electrochemically active material. The metal film situated at each end of the electrode stack has the electrochemically active material placed on one surface facing toward the interior of the battery. In some embodiments, the electrochemically active material of the anode is graphite and the electrochemically active material of the cathode is lithium metal oxide. The electrodes of each of the plurality of battery cell types are interleaved with a common electrode placed between each of the electrodes of each of the plurality of battery cell types. The connection tabs of the electrodes of each of the plurality of battery cell types are connected together. The connection tabs of each of the common electrodes are connected together. The interleaved stack of the electrodes is then compressed and placed in a containment shell. The containment shell may be a metal shell such as stainless steel or a non-reactive plastic. In other embodiments, the interleaved stack of electrodes is placed in a plastic pouch that is sealed. The containment shell or the pouch is filled with an electrolyte to immerse the electrodes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION A high capacity battery often consists of a multiple of low capacity battery cells connected in parallel. There is a strong desire to minimize the number of cells, for cost reduction, ease of assembly, and packing efficiency improvement. However this will require an increase in the capacity of individual cells. Unfortunately, the capacity of individual cells is limited by stability of the cell. This is true for all types of charge accumulators (battery cells and capacitors), but especially serious for lithium ion battery cells. A battery, the cell structure of a battery and a method of assembly of battery cells that embody the principles of this disclosure effectively prevents thermal runaway by limiting a short circuit current, and by providing a heat sinking capacity for cooling the location of the short circuit. This is accomplished by merging at least two different battery cell types in a stack, sharing electrodes of one polarity and interleaving electrodes of another polarity. A stack of battery cell types includes common electrodes of one type and may be either positive or negative electrodes. In some embodiments the common electrodes are positive electrodes and the stack further includes multiple types of negative electrodes. The common electrodes have connective tabs located in one location and the each of the multiple types of electrodes have connective electrodes have connective tabs located in unique locations for each of the types of electrodes separated from the connective tabs of the others of the multiple types of electrodes and the common electrodes. In some embodiments, some electrodes may have more than one connective tab to achieve low electrical resistance, and more uniform current distribution. On the other hand, due to limited space, and for the ease of production, the number of tabs should be minimized. Furthermore, it is sometimes desirable to have the aluminum tab of the cathode acting as a fuse. In this case a cathode is likely to have one tab only. Regardless of the number of tabs in each type of electrode, tabs of different types of electrodes should be situated such that they do not interfere with each other. In various embodiments, the connective tabs are located such that one of the types of electrodes are formed from another type of electrode of the same polarity by a mere rotation. Since electrodes on both ends of the stack need to be symmetrical to and congruent with each other, it follows that they are preferably of the common type, and that tabs of the common type should be symmetrically located. In some embodiments, the connective tabs of the common electrodes are located at one edge of the common electrodes and the connective tabs of the multiple types of electrodes are formed at locations on other edges of the multiple electrodes. In various embodiments, the connective tabs are formed at the edge opposite of the connective tabs of the common electrodes such that the terminal of the common electrodes is at one end of the battery and the terminals of the multiple electrodes is at an opposing end of the battery. FIGS. 4a-4c illustrate the anodes and cathodes of multiple interleaved battery cell types 500 embodying the principles of the present disclosure. In FIG. 4a, the common electrodes 510a and 510b are formed of the metal film such as copper. The copper film is fully coated with an electrochemically active material such as graphite except for the tabs 511 that remain exposed. The exterior electrodes 510a that are present at the ends of the stack of electrodes 500 are coated with the electrochemically active material on the one side facing the interior of the stack 500 of the electrodes, again with the exception of the tabs, 511 that remain exposed. The exterior surfaces of the electrodes 510a do not require coating, because these two surfaces are not facing electrodes 516 and 520 of opposite polarity and do not participate in the electrochemical reaction. The electrodes 510b within the interior of the stack 500 of electrodes are coated on two sides of each of the common electrodes 510b. Each of the common electrodes 510a and 510b have the connective tab 511 placed at a unique location aligned to facilitate connecting the connective tabs together and to an external terminal (not shown). Each of the interior common electrodes 510b is placed adjacent to one of the electrodes 515 520 of the multiple battery cell types (type A and type B in the present embodiment) and separated by a separator 535 of FIG. 4c. The separator 535 is generally a macroporous film such as polyethylene or polypropylene, as described above. The battery cell type A electrodes 515 and battery cell type B electrodes 520 are formed of the metal film such as aluminum. The aluminum film is coated with an electrochemically active material such as lithium metal oxide (lithium cobalt oxide and lithium magnesium aluminum oxide) except for the tabs 516 and 521 that remain exposed. Each of the battery cell type A electrodes 515 has the connective tab 516 placed at a unique location aligned to facilitate connecting the connective tabs 516 together and to an external terminal (not shown). Similarly, each of the battery cell type B electrodes 520 has the connective tab 521 placed at a unique location aligned to facilitate connecting the connective tabs 521 together and to an external terminal (not shown). The stack 500 of the common electrodes 510a and 510b, the battery cell type A electrodes 515, and battery cell type B electrodes 520 are aligned and compressed as shown in FIGS. 4b and 4c. The stack 500 forms a compact unit that is commonly referred to as a \u201cjellyroll\u201d. The jellyroll stack 500 is placed in a metal container 525 or a pouch and an electrolyte is placed in the container 525 and the container 525 is sealed. The connective tabs 511, 516, and 521 extend beyond the container 525. The connective tabs 511, 516, and 521 that are congruent at the same location on the edges of the common electrodes 510a and 510b, the battery cell type A electrodes 515, and battery cell type B electrodes 520 are connected together (e.g., through welding, soldering, crimping, bolt, screw, etc.). Then the stack 500 has three terminals and can be considered as a battery of two merged battery cell types. Both battery cell type A and battery cell type B share a positive terminal and the battery cell type A and battery cell type B has its own separate negative terminal. FIG. 4c is a cross section of the jellyroll 525 of FIG. 4b as cut through the common terminal 511 of FIG. 4b and placed within a shell 575 to form a battery. The jellyroll 525 has the common electrodes 510a and 510b each coated with the electrochemically active material 512 as described above. Adjacent to each of the common electrodes 510a and 510b are the interleaved battery cell type A electrodes 515 and the battery cell type B electrodes 520. The battery cell type A electrodes 515 and the battery cell type B electrodes 520 are each respectively coated with the electrochemically active material 517 and 522. Between each of the coated electrodes 510a, 510b, 515 and 520 is the separator 535. The separators 535 are each extended beyond the edges of the coated electrodes 510a, 510b, 515 and 520 that extends beyond the electrodes. The separators 535 may also wrap around the stack of electrodes. Each of the tabs 511 of the common electrodes 510a and 510b are connected to an aluminum adaptor 575 that feed through the sealing of the battery shell 575. It should be noted that the embodiment as shown in FIGS. 4a-4c, that the common electrodes 510a and 510b may be cathodes rather than anodes and still be in keeping with the principles of the present disclosure. Similarly, the battery cell type A electrodes 515 and the battery cell type B electrodes 520 may be anodes rather than cathodes and still be in keeping with the principles of the present disclosure. Any type of electrode (battery cell type A electrodes 515, battery cell type B electrodes 520, or the common type 510a and 510b) may be placed at both ends of the stack. The stacking sequence of electrodes 510a, 510b, 515 and 520 consists of a repetition of a preselected \u201cbuilding block\u201d. For example, a stack order of \u201cA, C, B, C\u201d, \u201cB, C, A, C\u201d, \u201cC, A, C, 2\u201d, and \u201cC, B, C, A\u201d are all valid repeating blocks. A stack consists of an integer number of whole blocks, with an exception that the first electrode on the top of the stack is \u201csplit into two halves\u201d, and that one of the halves is moved to the bottom of the stack. For example, a stack of electrodes of the order \u201cA, C, B, C, A, C, B, C\u201d consists of two repeating electrode blocks \u201cA, C, B, C\u201d. To form a valid electrode stack, the first electrode \u201cA\u201d must be replaced by two one-sided Type A electrodes. So a valid stack configuration is \u201cA, C, B, C, A, C, B, C, A\u201d, as shown in FIGS. 4a and 4c. An electrode stack of a first number (M) of merged cells 510a, 510b, 515 and 520 consists of a second number (T) of types of electrodes (515 and 520 in the example of FIGS. 4a-4c) of one polarity, and one type common electrode (510a and 510b) of a second polarity. The basic building block consists of 2T electrodes 510a, 510b, 515 and 520 each coated on both sides. The block may be repeated by a third number (k) times, where k is any positive integer, to yield desired capacity. The repetition yields 2kT double-sided electrodes. However the top and bottom ends accommodate one-sided electrode only. Thus one of the 2kT double-sided electrodes should be replaced by two single-sided electrodes. In summary, a stack consists of 2kT+1 electrodes, of which all but two are double-sided. It is known by one skilled in the art that there are other methods of stacking the electrodes 510a, 510b, 515 and 520. The method of stack construction described is exemplary and the it would be obvious to one skilled in the art to incorporate the merging of multiple battery cell types of the present disclosure into the other methods of stacking to be in keeping with the principles of the present disclosure. FIGS. 5a-5c illustrate the organization of the connective tabs 611, 616a, 616b, 621a, 621b, of the common electrodes 610, the battery cell type A electrodes 615, and battery cell type B electrodes 620 of multiple interleaved battery cell types embodying the principles of the present disclosure. In FIGS. 4a-4c, the common electrodes 510a and 510b, the battery cell type A electrodes 515, and battery cell type B electrodes 520 each have single connective tabs 511, 516, and 521. Referring to FIGS. 5a-5c, in order to prevent crowding in the vicinity of the connective tabs 511, 516, and 521 of FIGS. 4a-4c, multiple tabs 616a, 616b, 621a, 621b are located at an edge of the electrodes 615 and 620. To facilitate manufacturing, the tabs 616a and 616b are located on the electrode 615 symmetrically such that the electrode 615 is rotated horizontally to become the electrode 620. The connective tabs 621a and 621b are now located at unique locations on the edge of the electrode 620 from the tabs 616a and 616b of the electrode 615 FIG. 6 illustrates a structure of an embodiment of the electrode of multiple battery cell types embodying the principles of this disclosure. FIG. 7 illustrates the stacking, compressing, and packaging in a shell or pouch the multiple battery cell types of FIG. 6 embodying the principles of this disclosure. In FIG. 6, the common electrodes 710 are formed of the metal film such as copper placed in close proximity to a separator. The copper film is coated with an electrochemically active material such as graphite. The common electrodes 710 within the interior of the stack 700 of electrodes are coated on two sides with the electrochemically active material. Each of the common electrodes 710 have a connective tab 711 placed at a unique location at a first edge of the common electrodes 710 and are aligned to facilitate connecting the connective tabs together and to an external terminal (not shown). Each of the common electrodes 710 is placed adjacent to one of the electrodes 715a, 715b, 720a, and 720b of the multiple battery cell types (type A and type B in the present embodiment). The battery cell type A electrodes 715a and 715b and battery cell type B electrodes 720a, and 720b are formed of a metal film such as aluminum in close proximity with a separator. The aluminum film is coated with an electrochemically active material such as lithium metal oxide (lithium cobalt oxide and lithium magnesium aluminum oxide). Each of the battery cell type A electrodes 715a and 715b have a connective tab 716 placed at a unique location aligned at a second edge opposite the first edge of the common electrodes 710 to facilitate connecting the connective tabs 716 together and to an external terminal (not shown). Similarly, each of the battery cell type B electrodes 720a, and 720b have a connective tab 721 placed at a unique location at the second edge opposite the first edge of the common electrodes 710 and aligned to facilitate connecting the connective tabs 721 together and to an external terminal (not shown). The battery cell type A electrode 715a and the battery cell type B electrode 720b are placed at the exterior ends of the stack of electrodes 700 are coated with the electrochemically active material on the one side facing the interior of the stack 700 of the electrodes. The exterior surfaces of the battery cell type A electrode 715a and the battery cell type B electrode 720b do not require coating, because these two surfaces are not facing electrodes 710 of opposite polarity and do not participate in the electrochemical reaction. The battery cell type A electrode 715b and the battery cell type B electrode 720a within the interior of the stack 700 of electrodes are coated on two sides of each of the common electrodes 710b. In some embodiments, the connective tabs 716 of the battery cell type A electrodes 715a and 715b and the connective tabs 721 of the battery cell type B electrodes 720a, and 720b are placed in mirroring locations. The battery cell type A electrodes 715a and 715b and the battery cell type B electrodes 720a, and 720b are commonly manufactured with the battery cell type B electrodes 720a, and 720b being the battery cell type A electrodes 715a and 715b rotated horizontally in the illustration. This permits the two connective tabs 716 and 721 to be sufficiently separated to have two separate cell connection. In FIG. 7, the interleaved stack 700 of the common electrodes 710, battery cell type A electrodes 715a and 715b, and battery cell type B electrodes 720a, and 720b are placed in close proximity to a separator placed between each of the electrodes of the interleaved stack 700. The interleaved stack 700 is compressed and placed in the container shell or pouch 725. The container shell or pouch 725 is filled with an electrolyte and sealed. The connective tabs 711, 716, and 721 are respectively connected to the terminals 730, 735, and 740. The terminals 730, 735, and 740 allow the merged cell battery to be connected in series, parallel, or a hard series\/soft parallel configuration. FIG. 8 is a flow chart for a method of forming a multiple cell battery with interleaved electrodes embodying the principles of this disclosure. The method for forming a battery having multiple merged battery cell types is structured to prevent thermal runaway by cooling a shorted region within between electrodes. The method begins with forming (Box 800) multiple electrodes of a first polarity of a first battery cell type (cathode). Each electrode of the first battery cell type is formed with a connection tab placed at a first unique location. The method continues with forming (Box 805) multiple electrodes of the first polarity of a second battery cell type (cathode). Each electrode of the second battery cell type is formed with a connection tab placed at a second unique location. Multiple common electrodes of a second polarity (anodes) are formed (Box 810) with each electrode having a connection tab placed at a third unique location. It should be noted that while the method is illustrating electrodes of two battery cell types of the first polarity, any number of battery cell types of the first polarity may be formed. The connection tabs for each of the electrodes of the multiple battery cell types must be placed to avoid contact between the electrodes of each battery cell type. In various embodiments, the two battery cell types may have a common structure and differ only in horizontal orientation. The electrodes of each of the first and second battery cell types are formed of a metal film such as aluminum in close proximity with a separator. The common electrodes are formed of a metal film such as copper in close proximity with a separator. The metal film of the first battery cell type, second battery cell type, and common electrodes placed in the interior of the battery is coated on both sides with an electrochemically active material. The electrodes placed at the exterior surface have the electrochemically active material placed on one side of the electrode place toward the interior of the battery. In the embodiments as shown above, the exterior electrodes are the common electrodes. The electrochemically active material for the common electrodes is graphite and the electrochemically active material for the electrodes of the first and second battery cell types is a lithium metal oxide (lithium cobalt oxide or lithium magnesium aluminum oxide). The electrodes of each of the first and second battery cell types are interleaved (Box 815) with a common electrode placed between each of the electrodes of each of the first and second battery cell types. The stack of the interleaved electrodes is compressed (Box 820) to form a battery unit. The battery unit of the interleaved electrodes is placed (Box 825) in a containment shell or pouch. The containment shell may be a metal shell such as stainless steel or a non-reactive plastic. In other embodiments, the interleaved stack of electrodes is placed in a plastic pouch that is sealed. The containment shell or the pouch is filled with an electrolyte to immerse the electrodes. The connection tabs of the electrodes of the first battery cell type are connected (Box 830) together and the connection tabs of the electrodes of the second battery cell type are connected (Box 835) together. The connection tabs of the common electrodes are connected together (Box 840). The connection tabs of each of the common electrodes are connected together. FIGS. 9a-9c are schematics of embodiments of parallel structures of a multiple cell battery 900 with interleaved electrodes. FIG. 9a a battery cell structure 900 with a common anode 912 for each of the battery cell types 910 and 915. There are two types of cathodes 913 and 918. In FIGS. 4a and 4c, the common anode type 912 would be the anodes 510a, 510b and the two cathode types 913 and 918 would be the cathode electrode types 515 and 520.

Configuration of Photo Sticker Creating Apparatus 1.1. Appearance FIGS. 1A and 1B are diagrams respectively showing an appearance of a photo sticker creating apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1A, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 of an image processing apparatus is made up of a photographing unit 10 for photographing and editing and a background unit 40 for controlling a background during photographing. A space between the photographing unit 10 and the background unit 40 constitutes a photographing space R1 in which a user performs a photographing. When disposed and used in a game arcade etc., as shown in FIG. 1B, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is disposed in such a state that a portion of an upper portion and a side portion of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is covered with a shielding sheet 43. Further, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is disposed in such a state that an opening portion (entrance\/exit for a user) between the photographing unit 10 and the background unit 40 is covered with a curtain 45 on a lateral side. In this way, the space inside the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 (the photographing space R1) is shielded from the outside by the curtain 45. This allows a user to photograph an image in the photographing space R1 without caring about people's eyes on the outside. On the other hand, the curtain 45 does not cover the lower portion of the opening portion (entrance\/exit) on the lateral side of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1, and therefore, the photographing space R1 is prevented from being completely closed for security reasons. The curtain 45 and the shielding sheet 43 are printed with an image for advertisement, information on procedures of the game of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1, and the like. FIGS. 2A and 2B show a front view and a rear view, respectively, of the photographing unit 10. As shown in FIG. 2A, a front face of the photographing unit 10 is disposed with a camera 21, illumination apparatuses 26a to 26e, a touch panel monitor 23, and a coin insert\/return slot 29. It is noted that a bill\/credit-card reader or a money changer may be disposed instead of the coin insert\/return slot. The camera 21 photographs an image of an object (user) to generate a photographed image. The camera 21 is made up of an imaging element such as a CCD (charge-coupled device) or CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) image sensor. The camera 21 is not limited to the example shown in FIG. 2 in terms of the position and the number of the camera 21 The touch panel monitor 23 displays guidance, a demonstration screen, etc. of the photo sticker creating game and a game method thereof. The touch panel monitor 23 accepts an instruction from a user through a touch operation. The touch panel monitor 23 is made up of an LCD (liquid crystal display), an organic EL display, etc. A colorless and transparent touch sensor (e.g., of a pressure-sensitive or electromagnetic induction type) is superimposed on a screen of the touch panel monitor 23 and positional information (instruction from a user) can be input by touching with, for example, a stylus pen or a user's finger. The touch panel monitor 23 displays a background image selection screen that is a GUI for selecting an image of background and\/or foreground (composition image) to be composited with the photographed image generated by the camera 21. The illumination apparatuses 26a to 26e are apparatuses for irradiating an object with illumination light during photographing of an image of the object. The illumination apparatuses 26a to 26e are made up of a fluorescent light, a LED (light emitting diode) illumination device, an illumination device capable of stroboscopic light emission, etc. The coin insert\/return slot 29 is an opening portion for allowing a user to input a charge for the photo sticker creating game and to receive the change etc. A side surface of the photographing unit 10 is disposed with a speaker (not shown) for outputting a guidance sound, a sound effect, etc. to a user in the photographing space R1. As shown in FIG. 2B, the rear face of the photographing unit 10 is disposed with a tablet built-in monitor 33, a speaker 35, and sticker discharge ports 39a, 39b. The tablet built-in monitor 33 displays an edit screen that is a GUI (graphical user interface) for editing a photographed image generated by a photographing operation in the photographing space R1. The edit screen is formed to concurrently display two images to be edited so that a pair of users uses respective stylus pens to separately edit graffiti. The two concurrently displayed images targeted for the graffiti editing may be the same images or different images. The tablet built-in monitor 33 is made up of a tablet to which positional information can be input with a stylus pen, and a monitor having a display device capable of displaying an image. The tablet is, for example, a pressure-sensitive or electromagnetic induction type input device (touch sensor), is colorless and transparent, and is superimposed and disposed on a display screen of the display device. The display device is made up of an LCD (liquid crystal display), an organic EL display, etc. Therefore, the tablet built-in monitor 33 not only simply displays a GUI image etc. by the display device but also accepts an input operation from a user by the tablet. The tablet built-in monitor 33 may include a touch panel monitor and may allow the user to input information with a finger etc. The speaker 35 outputs sounds such as a guidance sound, a sound effect, and BGM related to an edit operation of the photo sticker creating game. It is noted that the number, design, shape, and the like of the disposed speakers 35 are arbitrary. The sticker discharge ports 39a, 39b discharge a photo sticker generated by reflecting the selection made in the photographing space R1 and details of editing performed in an editing space R2 based on the photographed image photographed in the photographing space R1. 1.2.

The controller 11 is respectively connected via a predetermined bus to a storage device 12, a communication device 13, a media drive 14, a ROM (read only memory) 16, a RAM (random access memory) 17, an image photographing section 110, an editing section 12, and a printing section 130. The controller 11 is made up of a CPU or an MPU and executes a predetermined program to implement general functions of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 including functions described below. The predetermined program may be installed in the photo sticker creating apparatus directly or through a communication line from a predetermined recording medium. The predetermined recording medium includes, for example, magnetic disks such as a hard disk drive (HDD), a solid state drive (SSD), and a floppy (registered trademark) disk, optical disks such as CD (compact disc), DVD (digital versatile disc), and BD (Blu-ray disc) (registered trade mark), magnetic optical discs such as MD (mini disc) (registered trade mark), or a removable medium such as a memory card. It is noted that the controller 11 may be designed as a dedicated electronic circuit for implementing a predetermined function. That is, the controller 11 may be made up of CPU, MPU, DSP, FPGA, ASIC, or ASSP. The storage device 12 includes a non-volatile storage medium such as a hard disk drive (HDD), a flash memory, and a solid state drive (SSD). The storage device 12 stores various pieces of configuration information and reads and supplies the stored configuration information to the controller 11. The recording medium making up the storage device 12 may be any non-volatile recording medium. The communication device 13 communicates with another communicating device (not shown) through an external network (not shown) such as the internet and a public telephone network, for example, or simply through a communication cable (not shown). That is, the communication device 13 communicates with another communication device such as a user's portable telephone, a user's personal computer, or central management server under the control of the controller 11. For example, the communication device 13 transmits transmission information supplied from the controller 11 to another communication apparatus and supplies reception information supplied from another communication apparatus to the controller 11. The media drive 14 is loaded with a removable medium 15 such as a magnetic disk (including a flexible disk), an optical disk (such as CD, DVD, and BD), a magnetic optical disk, or a semiconductor memory. A computer program and data are read from the removable medium 15 and supplied to the controller 11 or stored or installed in the storage device 12 etc. The ROM 16 preliminarily stores the program and data executed by the controller 11. The ROM 16 supplies the program and data to the controller 11 based on an instruction of the controller 11. The RAM 17 temporarily keeps the data and program executed by the controller 11. The image photographing section 110 is a block related to a photographing process and has a coin processor 111, a background controller 112, the illumination apparatuses 26a to 26e, the camera 21, the touch panel monitor 23, and a speaker 25. The camera 21 captures a moving image for live-view display before photographing and outputs the image data of the captured moving image to the controller 11. The camera 21 outputs to the controller 11 the image data acquired by photographing, which is performed based on an instruction from a user of an object. In this case, when receiving the image data from the camera 21, the controller 11 generates an image signal based on the received image data and outputs the image signal to the touch panel monitor 23. When receiving the image signal from the controller 11, the touch panel monitor 23 displays on a display device a still image or a moving image (live view) of the photographed object based on the received image signal. The coin processor 111 counts coins inserted from the coin insert\/return slot 29 and transmits a signal indicative of a counted amount to the controller 11. The controller 11 determines whether coins are inserted in a predetermined amount based on the signal from the coin processor 111. The background controller 112 controls a background curtain hung as a background behind an object (on the background unit side) in the photographing space R1. That is, the background controller 112 hangs and houses the background curtain under the control of the controller 11. It is noted that the background unit 40 may have structure with a chroma-key composition curtain affixed to a sheet metal. Alternatively, the background unit 40 may be made up only of a sheet metal painted in predetermined color (e.g., green). The color of the sheet metal may be color such as white matched to a background image. In case that hanging\/housing the background curtain does not have to be controlled in the background unit 40, the background controller 112 may not be included. An editing section 120 is a block related to an edit process, and includes the tablet built-in monitor 33, a stylus pen 37, and the speaker 35. The printing section 130 includes two printers 51a and 51b for printing a result of edit operation performed by the editing section 120 on a sticker sheet 55. Hereinafter, the printer 51a disposed on the left side viewed from the rear side of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 will be referred to as a \u201cfirst printer\u201d and the printer 51a disposed on the right side will be referred to as a \u201csecond printer.\u201d Only one printer is operated between the first printer 51a and the second printer 51b. The other printer is secondarily used instead of the printer in operation when sticker sheets run out in the printer in operation or when the printer in operation fails. The first and second printers 51a and 51b acquire image information edited by the controller 11 for printing on the sticker sheet 55. When completing a printing process, the first and second printers 51a and 51b discharge the printed sticker sheet 55 from the sticker discharge ports 39a, 39b. This printed sticker sheet 55 is provided to a user as a photo sticker that is a resulting product of the photo sticker creating game. 2. Operation of Photo Sticker Creating Apparatus 2.1. Flow of Photo Sticker Creating Game A flow of a photo sticker creating game by the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 and user's movement associated therewith will be described with reference to FIG. 4. FIG. 4 is a diagram for explaining user's spatial movement during the game. FIG. 4 shows a view when the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is viewed in its entirety from above. As shown in FIG. 4, a user A enters the photographing space R1 from a lateral side of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 and puts the charge into the coin insert\/return slot 29 of the photographing unit 10 to start the photo sticker creating game. Subsequently, the user A selects a background image and photographs and image with the camera 21 in the photographing space R1. That is, in the photographing space R1, the user A utilizes the camera 21 and the touch panel monitor 23 disposed in the front face of the photographing unit 10 to select the background image to be composited with a photographed image and to photograph an image of the user A and the like (the photographing operation). When completing the selection of the background image and the photographing, the user A moves to the editing space R2 located behind the photographing unit 10 in accordance with guidance (leading) of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1. The user A operates the tablet built-in monitor 33 to perform an edit operation such as writing graffiti on the photographed image in the editing space R2. It is noted that, If a user of the preceding group is using the editing space R2 (performing the edit operation) when the selection of the background image and the photographing are completed in the photographing space R1, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 does not guide the user A to the editing space R2. In this case, the user A waits in the photographing space R1 until the editing space R2 becomes available. Subsequently, when the user of the preceding group terminates the edit operation, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 guides the user A to the editing space R2 and the user A moves to the editing space R2 in accordance with the guidance. When it is determined that operations are concurrently performed in the photographing space R1 and the editing space R2, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 may control the photographing process such that a photographing time becomes longer in the photographing space R1 or may control the edit process such that an edit time becomes shorter in the editing space R2, so as to reduce the waiting time of the user. As described above, it is possible to separate the photographing space R1 for photographing and the editing space R2 for editing an image, and therefore, it is possible to guide different users to the respective spaces. Therefore, two groups of users can enjoy games at the same time in the one photo sticker creating apparatus 1. Thus, as compared to the case where the photographing and editing are performed in one space, it is possible to increase a rate of operation of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1. It is noted that, in the example described above, the photographing and the selection of the background image are performed in the photographing space R1 and the graffiti process and the printing process are executed in the editing space R2. However, a photo sticker apparatus may be configured such that the photographing, the selection of the background image, the graffiti edit, and the printing are performed in respective different spaces. In case that a plurality of processes is executed in one space as described above, although the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 can advantageously be reduced in size to make a footprint smaller, even when respective different groups of users concurrently perform operations in the respective spaces, only the two spaces are available for operations and, therefore, the number of groups of users capable of concurrently using the apparatus sets to be at most two. However, in case that the processes are executed in respective different spaces, it is possible to increase the number of users concurrently using the apparatus, and to improve a turnover rate. On the other hand, the footprint of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 becomes relatively larger, and therefore, a disposition location must have a relatively large area. The configuration of units of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is arbitrary and a unit configuration other than the described configuration may be used. A method of serving to multiple customers is arbitrary. For example, one photographing space and two editing spaces may be disposed. This configuration can improve the turnover rate of the photo sticker creating apparatus. Alternatively, two photographing spaces and two editing spaces may be disposed, respectively. In this case, since two (i.e., multiple) spaces are disposed for each of the photographing and the editing, it is possible to further improve the turnover rate of the photo sticker creating apparatus. 2.2. Overall Operation An operation related to the photo sticker creating game of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 will be described. As described above, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 composites a foreground or a background with a user's photographed image, and prints and outputs the image subjected to an edit process such as writing graffiti on a sticker sheet. FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing a series of operations related to the photo sticker creating game in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1. An overall operation of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 will be described below with reference to the flowchart of FIG. 5. When a user puts coins into the coin insert\/return slot 29 in a predetermined amount required for playing the game in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 (S1), the controller 11 starts the photo sticker creating game. It is noted that, among processes described below, a course selection process (S2), a background selection process (S3), a photographing process (S4), and a layout selection process (S5) are executed for a user present in the photographing space R1. A graffiti edit process (S6), a printing process (S7), and a sticker discharge process (S8) are executed for a user present in the editing space R2. First, the controller 11 executes the course selection process (S2). In the present embodiment, one course can be selected from a plurality of courses. In the present embodiment, for example, a \u201cnormal course\u201d and an \u201ceasy course\u201d are prepared. The easy course is a course intended for a user unfamiliar with the operation of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 and is a course in which the user can proceed with the game through an operation simpler than the normal course. The controller 11 displays a course selection screen for allowing the user to select a course of the game on the touch panel monitor 23 of the image photographing section 110. The user operates the touch panel monitor 23 on the course selection screen to select a desired course. The controller 11 stores the information of the course selected by the user in the RAM 17. After termination of the course selection process (S2), the controller 11 executes the background selection process (S3). In the background selection process, a background or foreground image to be composited with the photographed image is selected based on an instruction from a user. It is noted that, in the following description, for convenience of description, background images or foreground images are collectively referred to as a \u201cbackground image.\u201d The background selection process (S3) will be described below in detail. After termination of the background selection process (S3), the controller 11 executes the photographing process (S4). In the photographing process, the controller 11 controls the portions of the image photographing section 110 to take an image (photograph) of the user (object). In this case, a plurality of images (photographs) of the user (object) is taken in series. This enables the user to photograph images in various poses. The number of photographed images may be the same as the number of arrangement regions of the images printed on a photo sticker. Alternatively, the number of photographed images may be made larger than the number of arrangement regions of the images printed on a photo sticker so that the user selects an image printed on a photo sticker out of the photographed images. The trimming range selection process will be described below in detail. After termination of the photographing process (S4), the controller 11 displays a guidance screen for guiding the user to the editing space R2 on the touch panel monitor 23. The user moves to the editing space R2 in accordance with the display of the guidance screen displayed on the touch panel monitor 23 and subsequently performs an operation in the editing space R2. After termination of the photographing process (S4), the controller 11 further executes the layout selection process (S5). It is noted that the layout selection process (S5) may be executed in the photographing space R1. The layout selection process is a process of determining a layout of a photo sticker. A plurality of photo sticker layouts is prepared in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 so that a user selects a desired layout from a plurality of the layouts. After termination of the layout selection process (S5), the controller 11 executes the graffiti edit process (S6). The graffiti edit process is a process of accepting decoration to a photographed image by a user. Concretely, the user can operate the stylus pen 37 on the tablet built-in monitor 33 disposed on the rear face of the photographing unit 10 in the editing space R2 so as to write graffiti (desired characters, graphics, drawings) on a photographed image. In addition, the user can operate the stylus pen 37 on the tablet built-in monitor 33 to give an instruction for pasting a decoration image (a predetermined drawing pattern, a predetermined text, and a combination thereof) prepared in advance to the photographed image onto a desired region of the photographed image. In the graffiti edit process, the controller 11 accepts an instruction relate to a graffiti writing operation and a decoration image from a user and composites the line image generated by writing graffiti or the decoration image of the instruction with the photographed image. This graffiti process enables a user to create a photo sticker of favorite design. It is noted that, although the operation is performed by using the stylus pen 37 in the above description, the operation may be performed by using a finger. It is noted that the contents of the graffiti edit operation provided to a user in the graffiti edit process differs depending on a course selected by the user at the start of the game. For example, since the easy course is intended for a user unfamiliar with the photo sticker creating game, a procedure of operation of writing graffiti is made easier or the number of types of selectable operations is reduced as compared to the normal course. On the other hand, more various and complicated functions are provided to a user in the normal course as compared to the easy course so that the user can more elaborately write desired graffiti. After termination of the graffiti edit process (S6), the controller 11 executes the printing process (S7) and the sticker discharge process (S8). In the printing process, the controller 11 edits an image for print based on the background image selected in the background selection process (S3), the layout selected in the layout selection process (S5), and the contents of the graffiti and decoration image of the instruction given in the graffiti edit process (S6). Then, the controller 11 controls the printers 51a, 51b in the printing section 130 to print the edited image on the sticker sheet 55. After the printing is completed, the sticker sheet 55 printed with the edited image is discharged from either of the sticker discharge ports 39a, 39b. In a post customer process corresponding to a waiting time of the printing process, the controller 11 prompts the user to enter an e-mail address or an ID for SNS and transmits the image data edited for print through the communication device 13 to an external server. The user can download the image data from the server to a smartphone etc., of the user to enjoy the image data. As a result of the procedures as described above, a photo sticker is generated that includes an image acquired by applying desired decoration to a user's image. 2.3. Content Image Data Generation Process FIG. 6A is a schematic for explaining various content image data handled by the photo sticker creating apparatus according to the present embodiment. The various content image data are image data corresponding to each of the following applications of (1) to (9): (1) a sample image (116 pixel\u00d7140 pixel) for background selection (see FIG. 7); (2) a pre-live-view sample image 1 (450 pixel\u00d7540 pixel without horizontal inversion) (see FIG. 8); (3) a pre-live-view sample image 2 (291 pixel\u00d7349 pixel) (see FIG. 8); (4) a sample image-before-photographing (158 pixel\u00d7190 pixel) (see FIG. 8); (5) a live-view image (450 pixel\u00d7540 pixel with horizontal inversion) (see FIG. 9); (6) a photographed image (450 pixel\u00d7540 pixel without horizontal inversion) (see FIG. 10); (7) an edit image (500 pixel\u00d7600 pixel) (see FIG. 11); (8) a portable-terminal transmission image (1080 pixel\u00d71296 pixel) (see FIGS. 12); and (9) a print image (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel) (see FIG. 13). As described above, in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1, content image data for photographing such as model image data and content image data for graffiti (for edit) such as stamp image data, character image data, background or foreground image data are prepared in various image sizes corresponding to respective applications. For example, for the content image data, in which the National Flag of America is displayed, a plurality of image data is prepared in different image data size corresponding to the respective applications of (1) to (9) (see FIGS. 7 to 13). Since image data of various sizes are prepared for the same content image in this way, conventionally, in case that the content image data are switched, all the image data of a plurality of image sizes must be installed for the same content image data. Therefore, there is such a problem that considerable time and effort are required for switching the content image data. For this problem, in the present embodiment, one predetermined image size (largest image size) is installed in the photo sticker creating apparatus to generate the contents data for photographing and the content image data for graffiti having the image sizes for other applications based thereon. In detail, for a content image having one pattern (design), image data of various image sizes are generated based on the content image data having the largest image size. In this way, for a plurality of patterns (designs), image data of various image sizes are generated for each of the patterns (designs). With this configuration, it is not necessary to install the respective content image data of all the image sizes when the content image data are installed in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1, and therefore, it is possible to reduce the operation time and effort required for installing. It is noted that, these content image data are installed by a maintenance person of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1. A process of generating various content image data will be described below. FIG. 6B is a flowchart of the process of generating various content image data handled by the photo sticker creating apparatus according to the present embodiment. First, for a content image installing operation, the maintenance person inserts into the media drive 14 in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 a USB (universal serial bus) memory (the removable medium 15), which stores content image data having one predetermined size (in this embodiment, the image data for the print image (9) having the largest image size) for each of the content images of various patterns (designs). When the insertion of the USB memory is detected, an import instruction button for the content image data is displayed on the touch panel 23. The maintenance person presses (touches) the import instruction button. As a result, the controller 11 reads out the content image data stored in the USB memory and stores the data into the storage device 12 (step S10). Next, the controller 11 generates the various content image data (the image data (1) to (8)) corresponding to the image sizes of the applications based on the content image data stored in the storage device 12. Subsequently, the controller 11 stores the generated content image data into the storage device 12 and this process is terminated. It is noted that although the content image data of the predetermined image size is stored in the USB memory in the present embodiment, the data may be stored in a CD or a DVD and imported through a driver in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 into the apparatus or may be imported through the internet into the apparatus. As described above, when the content image data are updated for the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 of the present embodiment, only the data for the print image (9) (see FIG. 13) having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel) is first installed for each of the content images of the various patterns (designs). Subsequently, for each of the content images of the various patterns (designs), data of an image size corresponding to each application is generated based on the image data of the largest image size. In other words, the content image data (1) to (8) corresponding to the respective applications are generated based on the data for the print image (9) having the largest image size. With this configuration, it is not necessary to install the respective content image data of all the image sizes when the content image data are installed in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1, and therefore, it is possible to reduce the operation time and effort required for installing. The generation of the image data (1) to (8) for the respective applications will be described below. FIG. 7 is a diagram showing one example of the background selection screen. A user selects background image data through the background selection screen as a composition image to be composited with a photographed image acquired by photographing the user. FIG. 7 shows an example of the sample image (1) for background selection. In this case, any of background sets each having four scenes is selected. That is, the user selects one set from a plurality of sets and photographs an image for each of the scenes of the selected set. An upper-left National Flag of America image (116 pixel\u00d7140 pixel) in an upper-left \u201cAmerica\u201d background set is generated from an National Flag of America having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel) when the image is installed. FIG. 8 is a diagram showing one example of a screen-before-photographing after selecting the \u201cAmerica\u201d background set. In this case, a sample image in a thick frame shows a sample image to be subsequently photographed. The screen-before-photographing of FIG. 8 has regions A to C for displaying sample images (composition images of selected background images and model images) used as a reference when users photograph an image. The region C displays the sample images (4) (composition images of respective selected background images and model images). The users photograph images with reference to poses of models of first to fourth sample images (sample images in regions C1 to C4) displayed in the region C. Each of the regions A and B displays an enlarged image of the first to fourth sample images. In the present embodiment, the screen-before-photographing before photographing a first image is displayed. The region A displays the pre-live-view sample image 1 (2) that is the enlarged display of the sample image of the region C1. The region B displays the pre-live-view sample image 2 (3) that is the enlarged display of the sample image of the region C1. Similarly, the sample image of the region C2 is enlarged and displayed in each of the regions A and B before photographing a second image; the sample image of the region C3 is enlarged and displayed in each of the regions A and B before photographing a third image; and the sample image of the region C4 is enlarged and displayed in each of the regions A and B before photographing a fourth image. The users photograph images in the order of the first to fourth sample images (C1 to C4) displayed in the region C from the left. The National Flag of America background images having respective sizes (450 pixel\u00d7540 pixel, 291 pixel\u00d7349 pixel, and 158 pixel\u00d7190 pixel) in the regions A, B, and C are generated from the National Flag of America having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel) when the image is installed. In this case, the National Flag of America background image of the region A is not horizontally inverted from the National Flag of America having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel). FIG. 9 is a diagram showing one example of a screen during photographing (screen-during-photographing). In this case, the screen-during-photographing displayed at the time of photographing is displayed against the background image of the region C1 surrounded by the thick frame. The region A of FIG. 9 is switched from the sample image displayed in the region A of FIG. 8 to the live-view image (5) displaying a moving image of the users. That is, the users photograph an image through the live-view image displayed in the region A. An American flag background image of the size in the region A (450 pixel\u00d7540 pixel) is generated from the National Flag of America image having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel) when the image is installed. The National Flag of America background image and the moving image of the users (persons) in the region A are horizontally inverted from the National Flag of America image having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel). FIG. 10 is a diagram showing one example of a screen after photographing (screen-after-photographing). A still image after photographing is displayed in the region A as an image of the photographed image (6) without horizontal inversion for a certain time and this image is then displayed in the region C1. In this case, the screen-after-photographing before being displayed in the region C1 is displayed. Therefore, when the photographing is completed for the sample image displayed in the region C2, a still image after the photographing is displayed in the region C2; when the photographing is completed for the sample image displayed in the region C3, a still image after the photographing is displayed in the region C3; and when the photographing is completed for the sample image displayed in the region C4, a still image after the photographing is displayed in the region C4. A National Flag of America background image of the size in the region A (450 pixel\u00d7540 pixel) is generated from the National Flag of America image having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel) when the image is installed. The National Flag of America background image in the region A is not horizontally inverted from the National Flag of America image having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel). FIG. 11 is a diagram showing one example of an edit screen after photographing (edit screen). After all the photographing is completed, the users can write graffiti on a photographed still image (the edit image (7)). In the present embodiment, the number of users is set to be two. Therefore, the edit screen is a split screen divided into two and the users can edit an image through respective left and right screens. The still images to be edited may be the same image or may be respective different still images. A National Flag of America background image of the size for the edit image (7) (500 pixel\u00d7600 pixel) is generated from the American flag image having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel) when the image is installed. FIG. 12 is a diagram showing one example of a screen for transmission to a portable terminal after photographing (portable-terminal screen). The users can transmit a still image after photographing (a portable-terminal transmission image) as image data to user's portable telephones. A National Flag of America background image of the size for the portable-terminal transmission image (8) (1080 pixel\u00d71296 pixel) is generated from the National Flag of America image having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel) when the image is installed. FIG. 13 is a diagram showing one example of a screen for print after photographing (division-selection-screen print screen). The users select a layout for printing the photographed images through this screen. In FIG. 13, \u201c2 sheets\u201d is selected (surrounded by a frame). The selected print image (9) is printed on a sticker sheet of a predetermined size. It is noted that the print image (9) data is the image data of the largest size originally stored in the USB memory and the various image data are generated from this data. In addition, the image data printed on the sticker sheet is generated based on the content image data of the print image (9) installed first. That is, an National Flag of America background image of the size for the sticker sheet is generated from the National Flag of America image having the largest image size (2000 pixel\u00d72400 pixel) when the image is installed. It is noted that the image size of each of the content image data described above is one example and the image size is not limited thereto. Further, each application described above is one example and the applications are not limited thereto. (A) First Modified Embodiment In the above example, when content image data of an image size for a predetermined use is installed, image data having image sizes corresponding to the other applications are generated at the same time based on the installed content image data. However, this is not a limitation of the timing of generation of the various image data. For example, only the image data for the background-selection-time sample image (1) may first be generated and the image data of the other applications (the image date (2) to (8)) may be generated such that image data having an image size corresponding to each application is generated only for the content image selected by a user. (B) Second Modified Embodiment In the above example, the data of various image sizes are generated. However, the content image data may be changed in shape (image size and horizontal to vertical ratio) and angle of view depending on each application. For example, in the above example, the background-selection-time sample image (1) may be changed to form shapes such as a square, a vertical rectangle of an intermediate image size, a horizontal rectangle of an intermediate image size, an image for a whole body (rectangle with an horizontal to vertical ratio of 3:4), or an image for close up (rectangle with an horizontal to vertical ratio of 1:1.2). (B) Third Modified Embodiment The image sizes of the photographing content image data and the graffiti content image data themselves are changed in the above example. However, a portion of an imported image may be changed. For example, red or blue portion of an image of a national flag may be changed to black or, if an image includes characters (e.g., information on apparatus disposition location such as America), the font thereof may be changed to other fonts such as Gothic and Mincho typefaces. In this case, character data such as font, color, and position are stored as a table separately from the image data and a program is changed based on this table. (D) Fourth Modified Embodiment A language translation function may be further included in the above example. This configuration enables batch conversion of text information in the apparatus to, for example, English or Japanese, when the content image data is installed. Therefore, since the apparatus does not have to store all the language data of Japanese and English (the apparatus stores only one of the language data), a memory capacity in the apparatus can be reduced. Although English and Japanese are described in this example, the same applies to other languages. (E) Fifth Modified Embodiment Further, for applications other than the image data (1) to (8) as described above, an image may be resized for still image data inserted in a portion of moving image data, image data for portable telephones (such as an image displayed as an example image in instructions on how to play a game), and image data for advertising image data inserted in a sticker sheet (sticker sheet).

With this configuration, by installing the content image data of one image size, the image sizes corresponding to all the applications can be generated and stored. This eliminates the need to install the content image data of all the image sizes corresponding to the applications, and therefore, it is possible to reduce the time and effort required for installing. Other Embodiments The various ideas described in the embodiments can appropriately be combined and can appropriately be changed, replaced, added, omitted, etc., based on common general technical knowledge of those skilled in the art.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Described herein are techniques for sauna heating apparatus and methods. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous examples and specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention as defined by the claims may include some or all of the features in these examples alone or in combination with other features described below, and may further include modifications and equivalents of the features and concepts described herein. FIG. 1 illustrates views 110-111 of an infrared apparatus 100 to heat a body according to one embodiment of the invention. View 110 illustrates printed circuit board (PCB) 101 having a twisted pair cable 112 to provide power to PCB 101. View 111 illustrates an exploded view of PCB 101. PCB 101 includes layers 102-104. Layer 102 has conductive path 105 which may be coupled to source 113 to pass current Ia. Conductive path 105 may take any route and be of any width or height which is able to be produced. The route of conductive path 105 may be designed to produce a more uniform heat. Alternatively, the route of conductive path 105 may be designed to focus the heat generated. Layer 103 has conductive path 106 running coincident to conductive path 105. Conductive path 105 is coupled between point 108 and 109 to redirect the current Ia to conductive path 106 and set up complimentary magnetic fields between layers 102-103. Layer 102 produces heat from current Ia. Conductive path 105 may include a resistive element that produces the heat. Conductive path 106 may be metal which reduces the potential at layer 106. This may allow layer 106 to terminate the electrical field generated in layer 105. Infrared apparatus 100 may also include layer 104 situated between the body and layer 103. Layer 104 may have conductive path 107 running coincident to conductive paths 105-106. In the case in which layers 102-103 produce heat, layer 104 may provide blocking of electric fields generated from layers 102-103, and conductive path 107 may provide current Ib which is less than one thousandths of current Ia. Layer 104 may radiate the heat. Layer 104 may be coupled to earth ground. FIG. 2A-G illustrates printed circuit board stackups 211-217 according to other embodiments of the invention. Stackup 211-217 includes layers 201-209. Layers 201-204 may each have conductive paths and layers 205-209 may be electrically insulative planar substrates. Layers 202-203 may be similar to layers 102-103 of FIG. 1. Layers 205-209 may be FR4 material. Layers 205-209 may be made from mica. FIG. 2A illustrates a PCB stackup 211. Stackup 211 includes layers 202-203 having conductive paths, and layers 206-208 which may be electrically insulative planar substrates. The conductive path of layer 202 may be coupled to the conductive path of layer 203 to pass a current in a similar manner as described in FIG. 1 above. Layer 203 may be made of metal and layer 202 may have resistive elements to produce heat. Alternately, layers 202-203 may both include resistive elements to produce heat. The heat produced may be transferred to layers 206-208. Layers 208 may be made of a material which may radiate the heat to the body as indicated. Layers 206-207 may be made of similar material (e.g. FR4) to simplify manufacturing, or layers 206-207 may be made of different material. For example, layer 206 may be made of a heat insulative material such that heat is not dissipated in a direction away from the body. Also, for example, layer 207 may be made of a heat conducting material to aid in the transfer of heat toward layer 208. Layer 207 may be made thinner than layer 208 to aid in that heat transfer to the body. FIG. 2B illustrates a PCB stackup 212. Stackup 212 includes layers 202-204 having conductive paths and layers 206-209 which may be electrically insulative planar substrates. Layers 202-203 and 206-207 may function as described in FIG. 2A. Layer 208 may be made of a heat conductive material or made of similar material as layers 206-207. Layer 204 may be a conductive plane coupled to a low potential. Layer 204 may be brought closer to layers 202-203 by minimizing the width of layer 208. This may increase heat conduction through layer 208 and also decrease fringing of electrical fields produced by layers 202-203. Layer 209 may be made of a material that radiates heat which has been transferred from layer 202 or from both layer 202 and layer 203. FIG. 2C illustrates a PCB stackup 213. Stackup 213 includes layers 201-204 having conductive paths and layers 205-209 which may be electrically insulative planar substrates. Layers 202-204 and 207-209 may function as described in FIG. 2A-B. Layer 201 may be a conductive plane coupled to a low potential such as ground, for example. Layer 205 may insulate heat. In an alternate embodiment, layer 205 may radiate heat and there may be a second body in the opposite direction of the body indicating, thereby allowing the heating apparatus to heat two separate chambers or direct heat in two opposing directions. FIG. 2D illustrates a PCB stackup 214. Stackup 214 includes layers 201-204 having conductive paths and layers 206-209 which may be electrically insulative planar substrates. Layers 202-204 and 206-209 may function as described in FIG. 2A-C. Layer 201 may be a conductive plane as described above. Alternately, layer 201 may be a mesh. Layer 201 may be metal having a grating of less than or equal to \u215b inch. Any greater size of grating will have a reduction in ability to block the electric fields generated from layers 202-203. FIG. 2E illustrates a PCB stackup 215. Stackup 215 includes layers 201-203 having conductive paths and layers 206-208 which may be electrically insulative planar substrates. Layers 201-203 and 206-208 may function as described in FIG. 2A-D. Layer 208 may radiate heat to the body. Stackup 215 may be used as a minimal stackup that prevents electric fields from being propagated outside a sauna. In this embodiment, layer 203 may be made of metal in order to reduce the potential at layer 203 and provide some blocking of electrical fields being propagated toward the body. FIG. 2F illustrates a PCB stackup 216. Stackup 216 includes layers 202-203 having conductive paths and layers 206-208 which may be electrically insulative planar substrates. Layers 202-203 and 206-208 may function as described in FIG. 2A. Layer 210 may not be part of stackup 216. Layer 210 may be a conductive fabric attached to a cover in an enclosure residing the PCB. Layer 210 may be coupled to earth ground through the panel frame holding the conductive fabric. Alternately the conductive fabric may be part of a seat back cushion within the sauna. FIG. 2G illustrates a PCB stackup 217. Stackup 217 includes layers 201-203 having conductive paths and layers 206-208 which may be electrically insulative planar substrates. Layers 201-203 and 206-208 may function as described in FIG. 2A-F. Layer 210 and 201 may act as blocks to electrical fields. Layer 206 may be heat insulative such that layer 201 may not get above 30 degrees Centigrade. FIG. 3A-D illustrates a layer 300 and corresponding detail views according to other embodiments of the invention. Layer 300 includes metal traces 301, resistive elements 302, connection 303, and via array 304. This shows the top view of layer 300 where the direction of the body is into the page. Layer 300 may be similar to layers 202-203 of FIG. 2A-G, for example. Connection 303 provides an electrical current to metal traces 301 and resistive elements 302. The current flows from connection 303 to via array 304. The current drops down to layer 306. Layer 306 may be almost identical to the first such that the current is redirected such that the magnetic fields generated on layer 300 are cancelled by the magnetic fields generated on layer 306.

Magnetic fields 812-815 have field lines (not shown) outside heating elements 803-806 which are also complimentary between adjacent heating elements and their corresponding conductive paths. The coupling of these complimentary magnetic fields may prevent them from radiating into the surrounding area thereby reducing the EMI. In general, an infrared apparatus (e.g. infrared apparatus 800) may comprise two or more pairs of heating elements (e.g. heating element pairs 803-804 and 805-806). Heating elements 803-806 have conductive paths with uniform current density. Heating elements 803-806 are arranged in a circle 808. Circle 808 is perpendicular to a center line which is parallel to a heating elements' length. Adjacent conductive paths are spaced a distance (i.e. distance 810=distance 809) apart and have complimentary currents. Heating elements 803-806 are spaced a radius 811 from said center line intersecting the center 816 of the circle 808. In this way, an infrared apparatus may include two or more pairs of heating elements arranged in a circle. For example, 3 pairs of heating elements may be arranged in a circle as described above. The center points of the heating elements would look like the corners of a hexagon. Similarly, 4 pairs of heating elements may be arranged in a circle as described above, and the center points of these heating elements would look like the corners of an octagon. FIGS. 9A-B illustrate an infrared assembly 900 to heat a body according to yet another embodiment of the invention. FIG. 9A illustrates a front view of infrared assembly 900. Infrared assembly 900 includes heat reflector 901, infrared apparatus 902-903, and cabling 912. Cabling 912 includes a twisted pair which provides power to infrared apparatus 902-903. In one embodiment, cabling 912 couples infrared apparatus 902-903 in parallel. FIG. 9B illustrates an indicated view B-B of infrared assembly 900 of FIG. 9A. View B-B shows infrared apparatus 902-903, and a portion of heat reflector 901. Infrared apparatus 902-903 may be similar to infrared apparatus 700 of FIG. 7A-B. Infrared apparatus 902 includes heater element 908-909 and infrared apparatus 903 includes heater elements 910-911. Heating elements 908-911 may have conductive paths with uniform current density. Heater elements 908-909 may be set a distance 904 apart, and heater elements 910-911 may be set a distance 905 apart. In one embodiment, infrared apparatus 902 and 903 may be similar such that distance 904 is the same as distance 905. Heater elements 908-911 may be arranged in parallel along a single plane 912. Distance 913 between heater element pair 908-909 and heater element pair 910-911 is less than or equal to distance 906. Distance 906 is the closest distance between any heating element and a body pressed up against plane 907. Plane 907 shows where a grated metal cover may be placed. FIG. 9C illustrates another embodiment of the present invention in view B-B of infrared assembly 900 of FIG. 9A. View B-B shows infrared apparatus 902-903, and a portion of heat reflector 901 as in FIG. 9B. Infrared apparatus 902-903 are oriented 90 degrees from the orientation in FIG. 9B. Heater elements 908-909 may be set a distance 904 apart, and heater elements 910-911 may be set a distance 905 apart. In another embodiment, infrared apparatus 902 and 903 may be similar such that distance 904 is the same as distance 905. Heater elements 908-911 may be arranged in parallel along two planes 914-915. Distance 916 between heater element pair 908-909 and heater element pair 910-911 should be place as close as possible to increase coupling of the complimentary magnetic fields. Distance 916 will be greater than distances 904-905 due to the electrical insulator piece (not shown), electrical insulator material (not shown) and the thermally and electrically conductive sheaths (not shown) around each pair of heating elements. In one embodiment, infrared assembly 900 of FIG. 9B does not have infrared apparatus 903. Heating elements 908-909 are parallel to plane 907 at distance 906 away representing the closest a person could be to the heating element. To minimize the peak magnetic field at plane 907 (\u201cthe measurement plane\u201d), heating elements 908-909 have opposite polarities and are placed distance 906 (\u201cx\u201d) away from plane 907 and a distance 904 apart. This arrangement cancels out a significant fraction of the magnetic field. The amount of magnetic field cancelled may be optimized by minimizing distance 904. The minimum distance may be determined by factors regarding dielectric strength of the insulator occupying the space between heating elements 908-909 or mechanical restrictions, for example. This single pair of heating elements 908-909 in this configuration resulted in about 94% improvement of peak magnetic field radiation over a single heating element without magnetic coupling. Further modeling and experiments were performed which confirmed that adding additional pairs of heating elements in a circular pattern, as described in FIG. 8, reduced the peak magnetic field measured at the measurement plane. The additional heat element pairs were modeled with the same distance between adjacent heating elements and the same distance \u201cx\u201d from the \u201cmeasurement plane\u201d. For 2 pairs of heating elements (e.g. heating elements arranged as in FIG. 8) resulted in an additional 86.6% reduction of peak magnetic field radiation over the single pair configuration. For 3 pairs of heating elements (arranged in the circular pattern and resembling a hexagon) resulted in an additional 96.4% reduction in peak magnetic field radiation over the single pair configuration. For 4 pairs of heating elements (arranged in the circular pattern and resembling an octagon) resulted in an additional 98.6% reduction in peak magnetic field radiation over the single pair configuration.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS A specific embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. First Embodiment A photo sticker creating apparatus of one embodiment of the present invention is a game apparatus (game service providing apparatus) allowing a user to perform photographing, editing, and the like as a game (game service) and providing a photographed\/edited image as a photo sticker or data to the user. A photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is disposed in a game arcade, a shopping mall, a store in a tourist site, and the like. In a game provided by the photo sticker creating apparatus, a user photographs himself\/herself and the like with a camera disposed in the photo sticker creating apparatus. The user composes a foreground image and\/or a background image to a photographed image, or edits the photographed image, thereby designing the photographed image into a colorful image. After the game ends, the user receives a photo sticker and the like printed with the edited image as a resulting product. Alternatively, the photo sticker creating apparatus provides the edited image to a user's portable terminal and the user can receive a resulting product with the portable terminal. 1. CONFIGURATION OF PHOTO STICKER CREATING APPARATUS 1.1. Appearance FIGS. 1A and 1B are diagrams respectively showing an appearance of a photo sticker creating apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1A, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is made up of a photographing unit 10 for photographing and editing and a background unit 40 for controlling a background during photographing. A space between the photographing unit 10 and the background unit 40 constitutes a photographing space R1 in which a user performs a photographing. When disposed and used in a game arcade etc., as shown in FIG. 1B, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 of an image processing apparatus is disposed in such a state that a portion of an upper portion and a side portion of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is covered with a shielding sheet 43. Further, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is disposed in such a state that an opening portion (entrance\/exit for a user) between the photographing unit 10 and the background unit 40 is covered with a curtain 45 on a lateral side. In this way, the space inside the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 (the photographing space R1) is shielded from the outside by the curtain 45. This allows a user to photograph an image in the photographing space R1 without caring about people's eyes on the outside. On the other hand, the curtain 45 does not cover the lower portion of the opening portion (entrance\/exit) on the lateral side of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1, and therefore, the photographing space R1 is prevented from being completely closed for security reasons. The curtain 45 and the shielding sheet 43 are printed with an image for advertisement, information on procedures of the game of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1, and the like. FIGS. 2A and 2B show a front view and a rear view, respectively, of the photographing unit 10. As shown in FIG. 2A, a front face of the photographing unit 10 is disposed with a camera 21, illumination apparatuses 26a to 26e, a touch panel monitor 23, and a coin insert\/return slot 29. It is noted that a bill\/credit-card reader or a money changer may be disposed instead of the coin insert\/return slot. The camera 21 photographs an image of an object (user) to generate a photographed image. The camera 21 is made up of an imaging element such as a CCD (charge-coupled device) or CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) image sensor. The camera 21 is not limited to the example shown in FIG. 2 in terms of the position and the number of the camera 21 The touch panel monitor 23 displays guidance, a demonstration screen, etc. of the photo sticker creating game and a game method thereof. The touch panel monitor 23 accepts an instruction from a user through a touch operation. The touch panel monitor 23 is made up of an LCD (liquid crystal display), an organic EL display, etc. A colorless and transparent touch sensor (e.g., of a pressure-sensitive or electromagnetic induction type) is superimposed on a screen of the touch panel monitor 23 and positional information (instruction from a user) can be input by touching with, for example, a stylus pen or a user's finger. The touch panel monitor 23 displays a background image selection screen that is a GUI for selecting an image of background and\/or foreground (composition image) to be composited with the photographed image generated by the camera 21. The illumination apparatuses 26a to 26e are apparatuses for irradiating an object with illumination light during photographing of an image of the object. The illumination apparatuses 26a to 26e are made up of a fluorescent light, a LED (light emitting diode) illumination device, an illumination device capable of stroboscopic light emission, etc. The coin insert\/return slot 29 is an opening portion for allowing a user to input a charge for the photo sticker creating game and to receive the change etc. A side surface of the photographing unit 10 is disposed with a speaker (not shown) for outputting a guidance sound, a sound effect, etc. to a user in the photographing space R1. As shown in FIG. 2B, the rear face of the photographing unit 10 is disposed with a tablet built-in monitor 33, a speaker 35, and sticker discharge ports 39a, 39b. The tablet built-in monitor 33 displays an edit screen that is a GUI (graphical user interface) for editing a photographed image generated by a photographing operation in the photographing space R1. The edit screen is formed to concurrently display two images to be edited so that a pair of users uses respective stylus pens to separately edit graffiti. The two concurrently displayed images targeted for the graffiti editing may be the same images or different images. The tablet built-in monitor 33 is made up of a tablet to which positional information can be input with a stylus pen, and a monitor having a display device capable of displaying an image. The tablet is, for example, a pressure-sensitive or electromagnetic induction type input device (touch sensor), is colorless and transparent, and is superimposed and disposed on a display screen of the display device. The display device is made up of an LCD (liquid crystal display), an organic EL display, etc. Therefore, the tablet built-in monitor 33 not only simply displays a GUI image etc. by the display device but also accepts an input operation from a user by the tablet. The tablet built-in monitor 33 may include a touch panel monitor and may allow the user to input information with a finger etc. The speaker 35 outputs sounds such as a guidance sound, a sound effect, and BGM related to an edit operation of the photo sticker creating game. It is noted that the number, design, shape, and the like of the disposed speakers 35 are arbitrary. The sticker discharge ports 39a, 39b discharge a photo sticker generated by reflecting the selection made in the photographing space R1 and details of editing performed in an editing space R2 based on the photographed image photographed in the photographing space R1. 1.2. Internal Configurations Internal configurations of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 will be described below. FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing one example of a functional configuration of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1. The same constituent elements as the constituent elements described above are denoted by the same reference numerals and will not be described. As shown in FIG. 3, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 has a controller 11 for controlling an overall operation of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1. The controller 11 is respectively connected via a predetermined bus to a storage device 12, a communication device 13, a media drive 14, a ROM (read only memory) 16, a RAM (random access memory) 17, an image photographing section 110, an editing section 12, and a printing section 130. The controller 11 is made up of a CPU or an MPU and executes a predetermined program to implement general functions of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 including functions described below. The predetermined program may be installed in the photo sticker creating apparatus directly or through a communication line from a predetermined recording medium. The predetermined recording medium includes, for example, magnetic disks such as a hard disk drive (HDD), a solid state drive (SSD), and a floppy (registered trademark) disk, optical disks such as CD (compact disc), DVD (digital versatile disc), and BD (Blu-ray disc) (registered trademark), magnetic optical discs such as MD (mini disc) (registered trade mark), or a removable medium such as a memory card. It is noted that the controller 11 may be designed as a dedicated electronic circuit for implementing a predetermined function. That is, the controller 11 may be made up of CPU, MPU, DSP, FPGA, ASIC, or ASSP. The storage device 12 includes a non-volatile storage medium such as a hard disk drive (HDD), a flash memory, and a solid state drive (SSD). The storage device 12 stores various pieces of configuration information and reads and supplies the stored configuration information to the controller 11. The recording medium making up the storage device 12 may be any non-volatile recording medium. The communication device 13 communicates with another communicating device (not shown) through an external network (not shown) such as the Internet and a public telephone network, for example, or simply through a communication cable (not shown). That is, the communication device 13 communicates with another communication device such as a user's portable telephone, a user's personal computer, or central management server under the control of the controller 11. For example, the communication device 13 transmits transmission information supplied from the controller 11 to another communication apparatus and supplies reception information supplied from another communication apparatus to the controller 11. The media drive 14 is loaded with a removable medium 15 such as a magnetic disk (including a flexible disk), an optical disk (such as CD, DVD, and BD), a magnetic optical disk, or a semiconductor memory (USB memory). A computer program and data are read from the removable medium 15 and supplied to the controller 11 or stored or installed in the storage device 12 etc. The ROM 16 preliminarily stores the program and data executed by the controller 11. The ROM 16 supplies the program and data to the controller 11 based on an instruction of the controller 11. The RAM 17 temporarily keeps the data and program executed by the controller 11. The image photographing section 110 is a block related to a photographing process and has a coin processor 111, a background control portion 112, the illumination apparatuses 26a to 26e, the camera 21, the touch panel monitor 23, and a speaker 25. The camera 21 captures a moving image for live-view display before photographing and outputs the image data of the captured moving image to the controller 11. The camera 21 outputs to the controller 11 the image data acquired by photographing, which is performed based on an instruction from a user of an object. In this case, when receiving the image data from the camera 21, the controller 11 generates an image signal based on the received image data and outputs the image signal to the touch panel monitor 23. When receiving the image signal from the controller 11, the touch panel monitor 23 displays on a display device a still image or a moving image (live view) of the photographed object based on the received image signal. The coin processor 111 counts coins inserted from the coin insert\/return slot 29 and transmits a signal indicative of a counted amount to the controller 11. The controller 11 determines whether coins are inserted in a predetermined amount based on the signal from the coin processor 111. The background control portion 112 controls a background curtain hung as a background behind an object (on the background unit side) in the photographing space R1. That is, the background control portion 112 hangs and houses the background curtain under the control of the controller 11. It is noted that the background unit 40 may have structure with a chroma-key composition curtain affixed to a sheet metal. Alternatively, the background unit 40 may be made up only of a sheet metal painted in predetermined color (e.g., green). The color of the sheet metal may be color such as white matched to a background image. In case that hanging\/housing the background curtain does not have to be controlled in the background unit 40, the background control portion 112 may not be included. An editing section 120 is a block related to an edit process, and includes the tablet built-in monitor 33, a stylus pen 37, and the speaker 35. The printing section 130 includes two printers 51a and 51b for printing a result of edit operation performed by the editing section 120 on a sticker sheet 55. Hereinafter, the printer 51a disposed on the left side viewed from the rear side of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 will be referred to as a \u201cfirst printer\u201d and the printer 51a disposed on the right side will be referred to as a \u201csecond printer.\u201d Only one printer is operated between the first printer 51a and the second printer 51b. The other printer is secondarily used instead of the printer in operation when sticker sheets run out in the printer in operation or when the printer in operation fails. The first and second printers 51a and 51b acquire image information edited by the controller 11 for printing on the sticker sheet 55. When completing a printing process, the first and second printers 51a and 51b discharge the printed sticker sheet 55 from the sticker discharge ports 39a, 39b. This printed sticker sheet 55 is provided to a user as a photo sticker that is a resulting product of the photo sticker creating game. 2. OPERATION OF PHOTO STICKER CREATING APPARATUS 2.1. Flow of Photo Sticker Creating Game A flow of a photo sticker creating game by the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 and user's movement associated therewith will be described with reference to FIG. 4. FIG. 4 is a diagram for explaining user's spatial movement during the game. FIG. 4 shows a view when the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is viewed in its entirety from above. As shown in FIG. 4, a user A enters the photographing space R1 from a lateral side of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 and puts the charge into the coin insert\/return slot 29 of the photographing unit 10 to start the photo sticker creating game. Subsequently, the user A selects a background image and photographs and image with the camera 21 in the photographing space R1. That is, in the photographing space R1, the user A utilizes the camera 21 and the touch panel monitor 23 disposed in the front face of the photographing unit 10 to select the background image to be composited with a photographed image and to photograph an image of the user A and the like (the photographing operation). When completing the selection of the background image and the photographing, the user A moves to the editing space R2 located behind the photographing unit 10 in accordance with guidance (leading) of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1. The user A operates the tablet built-in monitor 33 to perform an edit operation such as writing graffiti on the photographed image in the editing space R2. It is noted that, If a user of the preceding group is using the editing space R2 (performing the edit operation) when the selection of the background image and the photographing are completed in the photographing space R1, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 does not guide the user A to the editing space R2. In this case, the user A waits in the photographing space R1 until the editing space R2 becomes available. Subsequently, when the user of the preceding group terminates the edit operation, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 guides the user A to the editing space R2 and the user A moves to the editing space R2 in accordance with the guidance. When it is determined that operations are concurrently performed in the photographing space R1 and the editing space R2, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 may control the photographing process such that a photographing time becomes longer in the photographing space R1 or may control the edit process such that an edit time becomes shorter in the editing space R2, so as to reduce the waiting time of the user. As described above, it is possible to separate the photographing space R1 for photographing and the editing space R2 for editing an image, and therefore, it is possible to guide different users to the respective spaces. Therefore, two groups of users can enjoy games at the same time in the one photo sticker creating apparatus 1. Thus, as compared to the case where the photographing and editing are performed in one space, it is possible to increase a rate of operation of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1. It is noted that, in the example described above, the photographing and the selection of the background image are performed in the photographing space R1 and the graffiti process and the printing process are executed in the editing space R2. However, a photo sticker creating apparatus may be configured such that the photographing, the selection of the background image, the graffiti edit, and the printing are performed in respective different spaces. In case that a plurality of processes is executed in one space as described above, although the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 can advantageously be reduced in size to make a footprint smaller, even when respective different groups of users concurrently perform operations in the respective spaces, only the two spaces are available for operations, and therefore, the number of groups of users capable of concurrently using the apparatus sets to be at most two. However, in case that the processes are executed in respective different spaces, it is possible to increase the number of users concurrently using the apparatus, and to improve a turnover rate. On the other hand, the footprint of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 becomes relatively larger, and therefore, a disposition location must have a relatively large area. The configuration of units of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is arbitrary and a unit configuration other than the described configuration may be used. A method of serving to multiple customers is arbitrary. For example, one photographing space and two editing spaces may be disposed. This configuration can improve the turnover rate of the photo sticker creating apparatus. Alternatively, two photographing spaces and two editing spaces may be disposed, respectively. In this case, since two (i.e., multiple) spaces are disposed for each of the photographing and the editing, it is possible to further improve the turnover rate of the photo sticker creating apparatus. 2.2. Overall Operation An operation related to the photo sticker creating game of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 will be described. As described above, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 composites a foreground or a background with a user's photographed image, and prints and outputs the image subjected to an edit process such as writing graffiti on a sticker sheet. FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing a series of operations related to the photo sticker creating game in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1. An overall operation of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 will be described below with reference to the flowchart of FIG. 5. When a user puts coins into the coin insert\/return slot 29 in a predetermined amount required for playing the game in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 (S1), the controller 11 starts the photo sticker creating game. It is noted that, among processes described below, a course selection process (S2), a background selection process (S3), a photographing process (S4), and a layout selection process (S5) are executed for a user present in the photographing space R1. A graffiti edit process (S6), a printing process (S7), and a sticker discharge process (S8) are executed for a user present in the editing space R2. First, the controller 11 executes the course selection process (S2). In the present embodiment, one course can be selected from a plurality of courses. In the present embodiment, for example, a \u201cnormal course\u201d and an \u201ceasy course\u201d are prepared. The easy course is a course intended for a user unfamiliar with the operation of the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 and is a course in which the user can proceed with the game through an operation simpler than the normal course. The controller 11 displays a course selection screen with which the user selects a course of the game on the touch panel monitor 23 of the image photographing section 110. The user operates the touch panel monitor 23 on the course selection screen to select a desired course. The controller 11 stores the information of the course selected by the user in the RAM 17. After termination of the course selection process (S2), the controller 11 performs the background selection process (S3). In the background selection process, a background or foreground image to be composited with the photographed image is selected based on an instruction from a user. It is noted that the background image or the foreground image is collectively referred to as \u201cbackground image\u201d for convenient in the following descriptions. The background selection process (S3) will be described below in detail. After termination of the trimming range selection process (S3), the controller 11 executes the photographing process (S4). In the photographing process, the controller 11 controls the portions of the image photographing section 110 to take an image (photograph) of the user (object). In this case, a plurality of images (photographs) of the user (object) is taken in series. This enables the user to photograph images in various poses. The number of photographed images may be the same as the number of arrangement regions of the images printed on a photo sticker. Alternatively, the number of photographed images may be made larger than the number of arrangement regions of the images printed on a photo sticker so that the user selects an image printed on a photo sticker out of the photographed images. After termination of the photographing process (S4), the controller 11 displays a guidance screen for guiding the user to the editing space R2 on the touch panel monitor 23. The user moves to the editing space R2 in accordance with the display of the guidance screen displayed on the touch panel monitor 23 and subsequently performs an operation in the editing space R2. After termination of the photographing process (S4), the controller 11 further executes the layout selection process (S5). The layout selection process is a process of determining a layout of a photo sticker. A plurality of photo sticker layouts is prepared in the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 so that a user selects a desired layout from a plurality of the layouts. The layout selection process will be described below in detail. It is noted that the layout selection process (S5) may be executed in the photographing space R1. After termination of the layout selection process (S5), the controller 11 executes the graffiti edit process (S6). The graffiti edit process is a process of accepting decoration to a photographed image by a user. Concretely, the user can operate the stylus pen 37 on the tablet built-in monitor 33 disposed on the rear face of the photographing unit 10 in the editing space R2 so as to write graffiti (desired characters, graphics, drawings) on a photographed image. In addition, the user can operate the stylus pen 37 on the tablet built-in monitor 33 to give an instruction for pasting of a stamp image of a decoration image (a predetermined drawing pattern, a predetermined text, and a combination thereof) prepared in advance to the photographed image onto a desired region of the photographed image. In the graffiti edit process, the controller 11 accepts an instruction relate to a graffiti writing operation and a decoration image from a user and composites the line image generated by writing graffiti or the decoration image (stamp image) of the instruction with the photographed image. This graffiti process enables a user to create a photo sticker of favorite design. It is noted that the contents of the graffiti edit operation provided to a user in the graffiti edit process differs depending on a course selected by the user at the start of the game. For example, since the easy course is intended for a user unfamiliar with the photo sticker creating game, a procedure of operation of writing graffiti is made easier or the number of types of selectable operations is reduced as compared to the normal course. On the other hand, more various and complicated functions are provided to a user in the normal course as compared to the easy course so that the user can more elaborately write desired graffiti. It is noted that, although the operation is performed by using the stylus pen 37 in the above description, the operation may be performed by using a finger. After termination of the graffiti edit process (S6), the controller 11 executes the printing process (S7) and the sticker discharge process (S8). In the printing process, the controller 11 edits an image for print based on the background image selected in the background selection process (S3), the layout selected in the layout selection process (S5), and the contents of the graffiti and decoration image of the instruction given in the graffiti edit process (S6). The controller 11 controls the printers 51a and 51b in the printing section 130 to print the edited image on the sticker sheet 55. After the printing is completed, the sticker sheet 55 printed with the edited image is discharged from either of the sticker discharge ports 39a, 39b. In a post customer process corresponding to a waiting time of the printing process, the controller 11 prompts the user to enter an e-mail address or an ID for SNS and transmits the image data through the communication device 13 to an external server. The user can download the image data from the server to a smartphone etc., of the user to enjoy the image data. As a result of the procedures as described above, a photo sticker is generated that includes an image acquired by applying desired decoration to a user's image. A process (stamp image pasting process) at the time of pasting a stamp image 100 to a photographed image in the graffiti edit process (S6) will be described by a concrete example. 2.3. Stamp Image Pasting Process FIG. 6 is a diagram showing an example of the stamp image pasting process. In this case, the number of users is set to be two and two edit screens 400 are prepared on a display screen 300 so that each of the users can write graffiti. As shown in FIG. 6, the users can paste the stamp images 100 displayed within contents palettes (content image selection screens) 102 to the edit screens 400. In this case, the heart-shaped stamp image 100 is pasted to the (left) edit screen 400. In addition, the content images within the contents palettes 102 are switched to the display of different content images by switching the tabs 101. FIG. 7 is a flowchart of the stamp image pasting process executed by the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 according to the present invention. In this case, description will be made of a process in a series of operations when a user first selects the stamp image 100 and performs an operation such as rotating the stamp image followed by selecting and pasting the new stamp image 100 as an example. In FIG. 7, first, a stamp image selecting process is executed and the stamp image 100 is displayed on the edit screen 400 (step S9). The stamp image selecting process (step S9) will be described below in detail. FIG. 8 is a flowchart showing in detail the stamp image selecting process (step S9) of FIG. 7. First, the user touches and selects the desired stamp image 100 within the content palette 102. As a result, the controller 11 selects the selected stamp image 100 (step S90). Next, the user touches and designates a display position of the selected stamp image 100 within the edit screen 400. As a result, the controller 11 sets the display position of the stamp image to the designated position (step S91). The controller 11 displays the selected stamp image 100 at the designated display position within the edit screen 400 and also displays an operation button 104 (see FIG. 9 etc.) for scaling up\/down and rotating the stamp image (step S92), and this process is terminated. In this case, the operation button 104 displayed in step S92 will be described below in more detail. FIG. 9 is a diagram showing one example of the operation button. As shown in FIG. 9, an operation region 200 (portion displayed in gray) is inside a region, which surrounds the displayed stamp image 100 (heart). The operation button 104 is displayed at the lower right of the operation region 200 for scaling up\/down and rotating the stamp image 100 on the basis of the center of the stamp image 100. In particular, the stamp image 100 such as eyeglasses can be scaled and rotated on the basis of the center of the eyeglasses to be displayed the eyeglasses at an angle that matches the preference of the user. In addition, when moving the stamp image 100 within the edit screen 400, the user can move the stamp image 100 in the operation region 200 by moving the operation region 200 in such a state that the user keeps touching this operation region 200. For example, when the small stamp image 100 such as eyelashes is moved with a finger or a stylus pen, it is conventionally difficult to move the stamp image 100 because the image is hidden by a tip of the finger or the stylus pen. In contrast, according to a method of moving the stamp image 100 of the present embodiment, the user can position the stamp image 100 while confirming the position thereof in detail without hiding the stamp image behind the finger or the stylus pen by touching the operation region 200 without touching the stamp image itself. It is noted that the controller 11 may provide control such that the operation region 200 is displayed in the same size for all the stamp images 100 (such that the size of the operation region 200 is not changed). That is, in case that the stamp image 100 is scaled down, the controller 11 provides control such that the operation region 200 is retained in a region larger than the stamp image 100. In addition, the controller 11 may provide control such that the operation region 200 is displayed in dimensions (size) changed for each of the stamp images 100. In addition, the controller 11 provides control such that the size of the operation region 200 is not scaled down and is kept in the same size even when the stamp image 100 is scaled down (the range of the operation region 200 may be kept constant). In addition, the controller 11 may provide control such that the operation region 200 is scaled down to a predetermined size (lower limit of the size of the operation region 200) as the stamp image 100 is scaled down. With this control, the operation region 200 remains large even when the stamp image 100 is scaled down, and therefore, a user can perform an operation such as an operation of moving, rotating, or scaling up\/down the stamp image 100 while viewing the scaled-down stamp image 100. In this case, on the operation button 104 displayed at the lower right of the operation region 200, a drag in a straight arrow direction corresponds to a scaling operation and a drag in an arc arrow direction (touch movement) corresponds to a rotation operation. It is noted that although the controller 11 provides control such that the operation region 200 is displayed in gray, the controller 11 may provide control such that only a frame is displayed. In addition, although the operation button is displayed at the lower right of the operation region 200, the operation button may be displayed at the upper left of the operation region 200, and may be displayed in any place as long as a user can understand that the stamp image 100 is to be edited. Further, the operation button may have only the operation function of scaling-up\/down As shown in FIG. 10, a delete button (trash box) 106 for deleting the selected stamp image 100 may further be included. When the user touches the delete button 106 of a trash can mark, the stamp image (heart) 100 and the operation button 104 are deleted from the edit screen 400. FIG. 11 is a diagram showing an example of a scale-down operation of the stamp image 100. As shown in FIG. 11, when the operation button 104 is touched and dragged (touch-moved) in the arrow direction by the user, the stamp image (heart) 100 is scaled down. In this case, the stamp image is rotated by dragging in a range of 45 to 90 degrees and is scaled up\/down by movement at 45 degrees. FIG. 12 is a diagram showing an example of a rotation operation of the stamp image 100. As shown in FIG. 12, when the operation button 104 is touched and vertically dragged (touch-moved) in the arrow direction by the user, the stamp image (heart) 100 is rotated by 90 degrees. It is noted that an inversion operation button for performing this inversion operation may be displayed in the operation region 200. An inversion function is a function of inverting the stamp image horizontally by 180 degrees (horizontal inversion) and vertically 180 degrees (vertical inversion). In addition, a function of returning to an original angle may also be included. For example, the controller 11 may provide control to display a button for changing the angle of the stamp image 100 through the rotation operation and simultaneously retuning the angle to the angle before the change (an angle returning button). Further, after the rotation or scaling-up\/down operation, the controller 11 may provide control to display a depth rotation (three-dimensionally rotating the stamp image 100 by 360 degrees around the stamp image 100) button. It is noted that when the user keeps pressing this button for a long time, the stamp image keeps rotating 360 degrees, and when the user releases (performs a touch-up) from the button, the stamp image stops rotating at the angle at the time of the touch-up. Therefore, the user can easily intuitively adjust the angle corresponding to the stamp image 100. In addition, the controller 11 may provide control to display these inversion operation button and the depth rotation button depending on the stamp image 100. For example, the inversion operation button and the depth rotation button are displayed for the stamp image 100 such as eyeglasses having an inclination relative to a person. In addition, the controller 11 may provide control so as to display an undo button (for returning to the previous operation) for each of the stamp images 100. For example, in case that the scaling operation is performed after the rotation operation is performed, pressing this undo button returns a state to that after the operation before the scaling-up\/down operation. That is, the state after the rotation operation is implemented. Further, after the rotation and scaling-up\/down operations, the controller 11 may provide control so as to display the inversion function, the angle retuning function, the depth rotation function, and the undo function in a list-up format. Furthermore, the controller 11 may provide control so as to display the rotation and scaling-up\/down function, the inversion function, a horizontal function (the angle retuning function), the depth rotation function, and the undo function in a list-up format (FIG. 13) or may provide control so as to change the listed-up operation contents for each of the stamp images 100. It is noted that, as shown in FIG. 13, the controller 11 may provide control so as to display a list 105 of selectable operations listed at the lower right instead of the operation button. Returning to step S10 of the stamp image pasting process of FIG. 7, the controller 11 moves, scales, and\/or rotates the stamp image 100 in accordance with the operation of the operation button 104 by the user. That is, the controller 11 changes an attribute (position, size, direction) of the stamp image 100. The controller 11 determines whether an operation of moving, scaling up\/down (scaling-up\/down), or rotating the stamp image 100 is performed (step S10). If it is determined that an operation of moving, scaling-up\/down, or rotating the stamp image 100 is performed in step S10 (YES in step S10), the controller 11 stores the attribute (position, size, direction) of the stamp image 100 after movement, scaling-up\/down, and\/or rotation into the storage device 12 (step S11). That is, when an attribute with respect to the content image is changed, the controller 11 stores the changed attribute into the storage device 12. Next, the controller 11 determines whether another one of the stamp image 100 is newly selected in the contents palette 102. This determination will concretely be described below. The controller 11 determines whether a touch is made at an arbitrary position on the screen by a user (step S12). If the controller 11 determined in step S12 that a touch is made on the screen (YES in step S12), it is determined whether a touch is made at an arbitrary position in the contents palette 102 (step S13). It is noted that, in step S12, the controller 11 repeats the process of step S12 until it is determined that a touch is made at an arbitrary position on the screen (NO in step S12). If it is determined in step S13 that a touch is made at an arbitrary position in the contents palette 102 (YES in step S13), the controller 11 determines whether the stamp image 100 different from the currently selected stamp image 100 in the contents palette 102 is newly selected (step S14). If it is determined that the new stamp image 100 is selected (YES in step S14), the controller 11 displays the new stamp image 100 based on the attribute (position, size, direction (rotation angle)) of the previous stamp image 100 stored in the storage device 12 (step S15). That is, the controller 11 displays the newly selected stamp image 100 with the same attribute as the attribute of the previous stamp image 100 displayed in the edit screen 400. Next, returning to step S10 again, the controller 11 determines whether the new stamp image 100 is moved, scaled up\/down, or rotated. Each of FIGS. 14A to 14C is a diagram for concretely describing the process of step S15 of FIG. 7. As shown in FIGS. 14A to 14C, the user selects and displays the stamp image (heart) 100 on the edit screen 400 (FIG. 14A) and rotates the stamp image 100 shown in FIG. 14A with the operation button 104 as shown in FIG. 14B. Next, the user can then select the different stamp image (star) 100 out of the contents palette 102 instead of the stamp image (heart) 100 to newly paste the stamp image (star) 100 on the edit screen 400 while retaining the attribute of the stamp image (heart) 100 (FIG. 14C). Conventionally, in case that the stamp image 100 is changed, the edit process is executed again by using an undo process (returning to the previous operation) or a deleting process. In contrast, in the process of the present embodiment, since the user can newly paste the desired stamp image 100 while retaining the attributes (preceding edit details (position, size, direction (rotation angle)) of the stamp image 100 before the change, it is possible to further improve the user's operability. Next, when the user is satisfied with the pattern (design), position, dimensions (size), and direction (rotation angle) of the stamp image 100 currently displayed on the edit screen 400, the user fixes the stamp image 100 (making such a state that an operation of moving, scaling-up\/down, rotating, etc. of the stamp image 100 is unable). Conventionally, when the stamp image 100 is fixed, the user performs a touch operation to an arbitrary position on the display screen 300 to fix the stamp image 100. However, as described above, in the stamp image pasting process according to the present embodiment, the new stamp image 100 is possibly selected by a touch operation at an arbitrary position within the contents palette 102 by the user. Similarly, the stamp image 100 is also possibly moved by a touch operation within the operation region 200 by the user. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the stamp image 100 is fixed by a touch operation by the user in a region other than the contents palette 102 and other than the operation region 200. With this configuration, it is possible to improve the operability of the stamp image pasting process. A fixing process of the stamp image 100 in the present embodiment will concretely be described below. Returning to step S12 of the stamp image pasting process of FIG. 7, the controller 11 determines whether a touch is made on the screen. If the controller 11 determines in step S12 that a touch is made (YES in step S12), the controller 11 determines whether the touch is made in the contents palette 102 (step S13). If the controller 11 determines in step S13 that the touch is not made in the contents palette 102 (the touch is made in other than the contents palette 102) (NO in step S13), the controller 11 determines whether the touch is made in a region other than the operation region 200 (step S16). If the controller 11 determines in step S16 that the touch is made in a region other than the operation region 200 (YES in step S16), the controller 11 fixes the selection of the stamp image 100 currently displayed on the edit screen 400 (step S17), and this process is terminated. It is noted that, if the controller 11 determines in step S16 that the touch is not made in a region other than the operation region 200 (NO in step S16), the controller 11 returns to the process of step S12. (a) First Modified Embodiment When the once fixed stamp image 100 is selected again on the edit screen 400, the controller 11 may provide control such that the stamp image 100 can be edited again. In this case, for example, a re-edit button, which enables the scaling-up\/down and rotation operation, may be displayed. Further the re-edit button may be configured to enable operations of changing upper\/lower positions between the stamp images 100 and changing upper\/lower positions relative to a photographed person (changing layers). (b) Second Modified Embodiment As shown in FIG. 15, the controller 11 may provide control such that portions of the stamp image 100 (including the operation button 104) and the operation region 200 placed outside the edit screen 400 disappear from the screen. For example, as shown in FIG. 15A, when the operation region 200 is dragged by the user in the arrow direction, a portion (dash line portion) located outside the edit screen 400 is not displayed (FIG. 15B). Subsequently, when the user brings the operation region 200 back onto the edit screen 400 by a drag continued from FIG. 15A, the disappearing portion is displayed again (FIG. 15C). At this time, the user can edit the stamp image 100 again. In addition, in case that the stamp image 100 and the operation region 200 are entirely located outside the edit screen 400 and the touch is released, the controller 11 may provide control such that the stamp image 100 is fixed. The user can use this operation as the trash box function as described above. That is, when the user discards the stamp image 100, the user can drag the stamp image 100 to the outside of the edit screen 400 and releases the touch to discard the stamp image 100 without selecting the trash box function. (c) Third Modified Embodiment As shown in FIG. 16, the controller 11 may provide control such that portions of the stamp image 100 (including the operation button 104) and the operation region 200 placed outside the edit screen 400 disappears from the screen. When the operation region 200 is dragged by the user in the arrow direction as shown in FIG. 16(a), a portion located outside the edit screen 400 is not displayed (FIG. 16(b)). In addition, when the user brings the operation region 200 back onto the edit screen 400 by a drag continued from FIG. 16(a), the disappearing portion is displayed again (FIG. 16(a)). At this time, the user can edit the stamp image 100 again. In addition, in case that the stamp image 100 and the operation region 200 are entirely located outside the edit screen 400 and the touch is released, the controller 11 may provide control such that the stamp image 100 is fixed. The user can use this operation as the trash box function described above. That is, when the stamp image 100 is discarded, the user can drag the stamp image 100 to the outside of the edit screen 400 and releases the touch to discard the stamp image 100 without selecting the trash box function. In this example, although the controller 11 provides control such that the operation button 104 disappears when the operation button 104 is located outside the edit screen 400, the controller 11 may provide control so as to change the position of display of the operation button 104. In this case, the user can perform the rotation and scaling-up\/down operation. (d) Fourth Modified Embodiment As shown in FIG. 17, the controller 11 may provide control such that the non-editable stamp images 100 are collected and displayed within the one contents palette 102. As shown in FIG. 17, for example, in case that a user, who plays a game after a graduation ceremony selects (presses) \u201ccongratulations!\u201d as the stamp image 100, the user hardly changes the stamp image 100 of \u201ccongratulations!\u201d to the stamp image 100 representative of birthday unless the user plays the game on the user's birth day. Rather, the user may feel annoyed with a button such as the operation button 104 displayed with such the stamp image 100. Therefore, since it is not necessary to retain details (attributes) of the previous operation for these hardly changed stamp images 100, these stamp images 100 may be collected in the one contents palette 102. With this configuration, the user can comfortably select and edit the stamp image 100, which matches the preference of the user. (e) Fifth Modified Embodiment The controller 11 may provide control such that the image data edited by the user is transmitted to a user's smartphone etc. In this case, as shown in FIG. 18A, characters can be input in an e-mail address entry screen 500 up to 20 characters\u00d72 lines (40 characters) (a new line is automatically started after 20 characters are input). It is noted that although characters in capital letters (caps lock) can be used for input, the screen is set such that \u201c@\u201d and \u201c.\u201d cannot be pressed twice. Further, in case that an entered e-mail address violates the RFC standard because of \u201c@\u201d, a \u201cdomain\u201d button, \u201c.com\u201d, etc. at a first character, an error message is displayed after a transmission button is pressed as shown in FIG. 18B. In addition, in case that the transmission button is pressed without entering an e-mail address in the e-mail address entry screen 500, an error message is displayed as shown in FIG. 18B. Further, in case that the image data is successfully (completely) transmitted, a message as shown on the left side of FIG. 18D is displayed and, in case that the transmission is not completed within a predetermined time, a message as shown on the right side of FIG. 18D is displayed. 3. CONCLUSION As described above, the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 according to the present embodiment includes: a photographing device (21) configured to photograph a user to generate a photographed image; a display device (11, 23) configured to display a content image selection screen (102) with which the user selects a content image to be composited with the photographed image out of a plurality of content images; and an instruction receiving device configured to accept selection of a first content image by a user on the content image selection screen (102). The display device (11, 23) configured to display an operation region (200) including the first content image, moves and displays the first content image in accordance with movement of the operation region (200) corresponding to an operation of the user, and fixes the selection of the first content image when detecting a touch made by the user in a region other than the content image selection screen (102) and other than the operation region (200). With this configuration, in case that a small stamp image 100 such as eyelash is moved with a finger or a stylus pen, even if the stamp image (100) is hidden by a tip of the finger or the stylus pen, the user can position the stamp image while confirming the position of the stamp image (100) in detail by touching the operation region without touching the stamp image (100) itself. In addition, in case that the user selects a second content image after an attribute is changed for the first content image, the display device (11, 23) displays the second content image with the same attribute as the attribute of the first content image. With this configuration, in case that a content image within the contents palette is replaced, the content image can be replaced with a new content image pasted while retaining the attribute (position, size, direction (rotation angle)) of the content image before the replacement. Therefore, the edit time and effort of the stamp image can be reduced. OTHER EMBODIMENTS The various ideas described in the embodiments can appropriately be combined and can appropriately be changed, replaced, added, omitted, etc., based on common general technical knowledge of those skilled in the art. Other configuration applicable to the ideas disclosed in the embodiments will be described below. The order of the processes may appropriately be changed in the operation of the example of the photo sticker creating apparatus shown in the flowchart of FIG. 5. For example, although the background selection process (S3) is executed before the photographing process (S4) in the flowchart of FIG. 5, the background selection process may be executed after the photographing process. In addition, although the layout selection process (S5) is executed after the photographing process (S4), the layout selection process may be executed before the photographing process. The ideas shown in the above embodiments are applicable to an apparatus other than the photo sticker creating apparatus. That is, the ideas disclosed in the above embodiments are applicable to any image processing apparatus that is an apparatus compositing a composition image with a photographed image and that displays a selection screen for selecting a composition image to be composited with the photographed image. The embodiments described above disclose the following ideas of an image processing apparatus etc. It is noted that the photo sticker creating apparatus 1 is one example of an image processing apparatus. The camera 21 is one example of a photographing device. Each of the storage device 12, the removable medium 15, and the RAM 17 is one example of a storage device. Each of a background set and a background image is one example of a composition image. A base image 71 is one example of an image selection region. The background selection screen 200 is one example of a selection screen. The controller 11 is one example of a composition processing portion. The touch panel monitor 23 is one example of an instruction receiving device. A configuration of combination of the controller 11 and the touch panel monitor 23 is one example of a display device. Each of the printers 51a, 51b and the printing section 130 is one example of a printing section. In this case, the display device displays a content image selection screen (the contents palette 120) for allowing a user to select a content image to be composited with a photographed image out of a plurality of content images within the contents palette 120. In addition, the instruction receiving device accepts selection of a first content image by a user on the content image selection screen. In addition, the display device generates and displays the operation region 200 including the first content image, moves and displays the first content image in accordance with movement of the operation region 200 moved by the user, and fixes the selection of the first content image when detecting a touch made by the user in a region other than the content image selection screen and other than the operation region 200. Further, the display device can change an attribute of the content images and, in case that the user selects a second content image after an attribute is changed for the first content image, the display device displays the second content image with the same attribute as the attribute of the first content image. Furthermore, the display device generates and displays the operation button 104 superimposed on or located close to the operation region for allowing the user to execute an image process such as a process of rotating, scaling up, and scaling down the first content image. In addition, in case that the content image is scaled down, the display device provides control so as to retain the operation region 200 in a region larger than the content image. (1) The image processing apparatus (1) includes: a photographing device (21) configured to photograph a user to generate a photographed image; a display device (11, 23) configured to display a content image selection screen (102) with which the user selects a content image to be composited with the photographed image out of a plurality of content images; and an instruction receiving device configured to accept selection of a first content image by a user on the content image selection screen (102). The display device (11, 23) displays the operation region (200) including the first content image, moves and displays the first content image in accordance with movement of the operation region (200) corresponding to an operation of the user, and fixes the selection of the first content image when detecting a touch made by the user in a region other than the content image selection screen (102) and other than the operation region (200). With this configuration, in case that a small stamp image 100 such as eyelash is moved with a finger or a stylus pen, even if the stamp image (100) is hidden by a tip of the finger or the stylus pen, the user can position the stamp image while confirming the position of the stamp image (100) in detail by touching the operation region without touching the stamp image (100) itself. (2) The display device (11, 23) changes an attribute of the first content image. (3) The display device (11, 23) displays a second content image with the same attribute as the attribute of the first content image in case that the user selects the second content image after an attribute is changed for the first content image. With this configuration, in case that a content image within the contents palette is replaced, the content image can be replaced with a new content image pasted while retaining the attribute (position, size, direction (rotation angle)) of the content image before the replacement. Therefore, the edit time and effort of the stamp image can be reduced. (4) In addition, the display device (11, 23) displays an operation button (104) with which the user changes an attribute for the selected content image, the operation button (104) being superimposed on or located close to the operation region. With this configuration, it is possible to improve the operability of edit of the content image by the user. (5) In addition, the attribute of the content image includes a position, a size, and\/or a rotation angle of the content image. With this configuration, it is possible to improve the operability of the rotating, scaling-up, and scaling-down operations of the content image for the user. (6) In addition, the attribute is changed by rotating, scaling-up, and\/or scaling-down the content image. With this configuration, the user can acquire the content image, which matches the preference of the user. (7) The display device (11, 23) provides control so as to retain the operation region 200 in a region larger than the content image in case that the content image is scaled down. With this configuration, by touching the operation region 200 without touching the stamp image itself, the user can position the stamp image 100 while confirming the position of the stamp image 100 in detail without hiding the stamp image 100 with a finger or a stylus pen. (8) An image processing method includes: photographing a user to generate a photographed image; displaying a content image selection screen with which the user selects a content image to be composited with the photographed image out of a plurality of content images; and receiving selection of a first content image by a user on the content image selection screen. The displaying includes: displaying an operation region including the first content image, moving and displaying the first content image in accordance with movement of the operation region corresponding to an operation of the user, and fixing the selection of the first content image when detecting a touch made by the user in a region other than the content image selection screen and other than the operation region. (9) In addition, the displaying includes: displaying the second content image with the same attribute as the attribute of the first content image in case that the user selects a second content image after an attribute is changed for the first content image. (10) A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to the present invention stores an image processing program for allowing a computer to execute the image processing method as described above.","cpc_label":"G06F304845","ipc_label":"G06F30484","filing_date":"20160101","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20160922","examiner_id":"57300.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention relates to an image processing apparatus for editing and printing a photographed image on a sticker sheet., in the context of the novelty:  The image processing apparatus includes a photographing device configured to photograph a user to generate a photographed image .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION When a problem is detected, trouble-shooters typically want to know what changes occurred shortly before the problem was detected, what related problems may have occurred, whether others experienced a similar problem, and if there are any known solutions to the detected problems. The present invention provides a user interface that provides such information in a visual and readily accessible manner. This translates into more rapid troubleshooting and problem resolution, which in turn can reduce costs, increase productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction. FIG. 1 represents a datacenter 100, to which the present invention can be applied. Datacenter 100 includes virtual-machine hosts 102, 104, and 106. Host 102 includes a host machine 110 and a hypervisor 112. Virtual machines (VMs) 114 and 116 run on host 102. Host 104 includes a host machine 120 and a hypervisor 122. VMs 124, 126, and 128 run on host 104. Host 106 includes a host machine 130 and a hypervisor 132. VMs 134 and 136 run on host 130. Datacenter 100 is relatively small for expository purposes. The present invention can be applied to systems with smaller and greater numbers of hosts and virtual machines. Different types of hypervisors and virtual-machine monitors can be accommodated. Datacenter 100 is organized as a three-level hierarchy (datacenter, hosts, virtual machines), while the present invention can also be applied to hierarchies with lesser or greater numbers of hierarchical levels. To facilitate trouble-shooting and other management of datacenter 100, the present invention provides a user interface (UI) 200, represented at a particular time in FIG. 2. User interface 200 can be presented on a display 202. User interface 200 provides a datacenter image 100i, which is a topological representation of datacenter 100. In other embodiments, representations other than topological may be used. Datacenter image 100i includes host images 102i, 104i, and 106i, respectively representing hosts 102, 104, and 106. Datacenter image 100i includes connection lines 204 and 206, which represent network connections among hosts 102, 104, and 106. UI 200 also provides for various tags to be displayed in visual association with image elements for the datacenter image. For example, host image 106i is tagged with a \u201cPR\u201d sign 208 indicating that a problem report has been issued with respect to host 106. A problem report is a report of a problem typically issued by a customer of a datacenter. Host image 106i is tagged with a \u201cCC\u201d sign 210 indicating a configuration change has been applied to host 106. Host image 104i is tagged with a PR sign 212, indicating a problem report has been issued with respect to host 104. Host image 104i is tagged with a top-priority (fire) sign 214 \u201c\u201d (Chinese character for fire). Of course, other signs can be used for the overlays. UI 200, as shown in FIG. 2, might, for example, suggest that a top-priority problem associated with host 104 may have been caused by a configuration change of host 106. Of course, other possibilities may be inferred as well. Signs 208, 210, 212, and 214 are rendered based on overlay data objects, which are separate from a topological data object used to render the topological datacenter image 100i. Each overlay data object provides the data for rendering all image objects of a given type. For example, PR signs 208 and 212 belong to the same overlay data object. While, CC sign 210 belongs to an overlay object that is separate from the overlay object used to generate the PR signs. UI 200 provides an overlay selection list 220, which specifies a \u201cconfiguration changes\u201d overlay, a \u201cproblem reports\u201d overlay, a \u201cservice reports\u201d overlay, a \u201cknowledge base\u201d overlay, and a \u201ctop-priority\u201d overlay. Each listed overlay includes a respective check box that, when checked, indicates the respective overlay is active so that any signs that it bears are displayed in conjunction with datacenter image 100i. With the check boxes as shown in FIG. 2, the configuration change, problem reports, and top-priority overlays are active so that the PR, CC, and \u201c\u201d signs are displayed. In FIG. 2, the service-reports and the knowledge base overlays are not checked, so their respective signs are not displayed in association with datacenter image 100i at the time represented in FIG. 2. The signs displayed can be changed by checking and unchecking the respective check boxes, e.g., using a mouse or other cursor controller. Zero, some, or all of the overlays can be active at the same time. A \u201cconfiguration-change\u201d overlay is used to identify nodes for which a configuration change has occurred during a selected time interval. A \u201cproblem-report\u201d overlay is used to provide image tags that indicate problem reports have been issued for respective nodes represented in datacenter image 100i. A \u201cservice-report\u201d overlay indicates dispositions (e.g., whether or not a problem has been solved in response to a problem report) for respective nodes. A \u201cknowledgebase\u201d overlay indicates nodes that exhibit characteristics of a problem that appeared in the present or another datacenter and for which a solution may have been found. A \u201ctop-priority\u201d overlay identifies nodes with problems requiring immediate attention. Other embodiments may include overlays for other conditions and\/or not include one or more of the ones listed in FIG. 2. Most of the overlays represent data describing changes that occurred within a specific time range. At the data level, the changes are identified by comparing \u201csnapshots\u201d of datacenter 100 taken at different times. Herein, a \u201csnapshot\u201d is a description of a datacenter as it exists at a specified time, typically, but not necessarily, the time at which the snapshot data was collected. UI 200 includes a snapshot list 222 which lists snapshots according to the times represented by the snapshots. A user can select snapshots to be compared by checking and unchecking respective checkboxes. To define a time range, two snapshots are checked at any given time. By default, the most recent two snapshots are checked. For the time range represented in FIG. 1, for example, one configuration change occurred and two problem reports were issued between 2015 Dec. 9 10 am and 2015 Dec. 10 10 am. UI 200 provides a level control 230 for drilling down and for drilling up datacenter image 100i to provide more or less detail. Drilling down can be achieved by clicking on down arrow 232 and drilling up can be achieved by clicking on up arrow 234. From the condition of datacenter image 100i in FIG. 1, drilling down can result in the view of image 100i in FIG. 3, wherein VM images 114i, 116i, 124i, 126i, 128i, 134i, and 136i, representing respective VMs, are shown in relations to their respective hosts. Notice that signs 208, 210, 212, and 214 are associated with respective VMs in FIG. 3, thus more precisely defining the situs of respective events. Drilling up from the condition in FIG. 2 yields the datacenter image 100i with the hosts it contains hidden, as shown in FIG. 4. While datacenter image 100i provides for three hierarchical levels of representation (as shown in respective FIGS. 2-4), other scenarios can provide for more or viewer hierarchical level of representation. For example, the datacenter may belong to a group of datacenters; in that case another level will be added at the top. For another example, the VMs can include containers, adding another level at the bottom. For a third example, in some datacenters, hosts are arranged in clusters; in that case, there can be four levels, a root datacenter level, a cluster level, a host level, and a VM level. In these three examples, the datacenter images can provide four or more levels of representation. Overlays are designed such that the associated tags can appear at different hierarchical levels. For the top-priority overlay, the top-priority () tag 214 appears at all three hierarchical levels: top (FIG. 4), intermediate (FIG. 2) and bottom (FIG. 3). In this case, the component with which the top-priority () tag 214 changes as the lower hierarchical levels allow greater specificity. The greater specificity also applies to the other (e.g., PR and KB) tags; a difference being the latter two are not shown at the top level (FIG. 4), although their presence is represented generically by the top-priority () tag 214 of FIG. 4. Depending on the embodiment, the overlay may be designed so that its tags appear the same wherever they appear, an overlay may call for tags being modified. For example, tags may appear with unique identifiers (e.g., serial numbers) at one level and without unique identifiers at another level. In various embodiments hovering and\/or clicking a tag can expose more detailed identifications and explanations of what the signs represent. Initially hiding the details reduces clutter on the user interface, making it easier for a user to clearly and quickly identify what the major issues are in a given datacenter. This, in turn, enables the user to narrow down their focus when triaging a problem. A UI system 500 is represented in FIG. 5. UI system 500 includes a scheduler 502 for scheduling the generation of snapshots. Scheduler 502 can schedule snapshots: periodically; at specified future times; for immediate generation in response to a command; in response to detection of an event meeting a predetermined condition; or according to any other specified program. When a snapshot is to be generated, scheduler 502 directs a consolidator 504 to generate a snapshot. In response, consolidator 504 accesses various sources to obtain the data required to build a snapshot. Consolidator 504 can retrieve log files 506 from various resources within datacenter 100. These can include logs of configuration changes, error logs, usage data, e.g., from computing nodes, storage devices, network devices, and software entities. Problem and service reports 508 can be gathered. A problem report is a report of a problem, e.g., from a customer of the datacenter to a customer service for the datacenter. A service report is a report on the disposition of a reported problem; the disposition may include a solution for a problem. Consolidator 504 can also gather knowledge-base items. These can be documents describing problems and solutions that may have occurred with respect to other customers or datacenters. Some items may be retrieved from a local deposit repository associated with the datacenter. Other items may be retrieved from external sources, e.g., from manufacturer's websites and user forums. Instead of actually gathering the documents, the consolidator can simply acquire pointers to the relevant knowledgebase items. Consolidator 504 consolidates and organizes the gathered data and documents and consolidates them into a time-stamped snapshot of a database 512. Some of the data, e.g., reports and knowledgebase items, for a snapshot may be found in the database itself. In addition, database 512 can include configuration files 516 for datacenter components, hardware specifications 518 for datacenter hardware, and software version identifiers 520 for datacenter software and firmware. A graphic engine 522, e.g., a Python engine, interacts with UI 200 to determine the settings selected by a user, including active overlays, selected snapshots, and drill-down levels. Based on these settings the graphics engine generates an image 524 to be displayed. This image 524 includes the topological map 100i, the active overlays 526, and control settings 528, e.g., drill-down level and snapshot selections. Note that UI 200 can also include a cache 530 to aid performance; the cache can store recently or frequently used UI images so that a user can redisplay images without the images having to be regenerated by graphics engine 522. Such a performance enhancement can be important where a large number of nodes would otherwise require long latencies for rendering nodes and overlays. [RD] The cache can be used to store most frequently used overlay tags (such as the fire symbol, KB, PR, etc.); most frequently viewed topology (such as intermediate level nodes or bottom level nodes), most frequently used datacenter (given a list of datacenters for a given customer. The customer can view their datacenters on a geographical graph and if they frequently access the USA west coast datacenters more frequently than other datacenters around the world, then all associated node information could be cached in a multi-tier cache. Additionally, each geographical location for datacenters could have its own multi-tier cache (ex. USA-west, USA-east, Canada-West, Canada-East, Europe-West, Europe-East etc.). The multi-tier cache (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary) would function such that an entire datacenter \u201cview\u201d, i.e., all topology-levels would be cached in the primary cache, all snapshot differences would be stored in the secondary cache, all overlay-related information would be cached in the tertiary cache, all related\/associated issues surmised from the overlay information would be in the quaternary cache (presumably, this would be the least-frequently accessed). However, the caching strategy may be configurable by the user\/administrator depending on their usage\/needs of the system. UI system 500 implements a user-interface process 600, also implementable by other systems, as flow charted in FIG. 6. At 601, snapshot generation is scheduled. The scheduling can be periodic, immediate in response to a trigger, based on a detection of a condition, otherwise programmed, or a combination of the above. Each snapshot calls for gathering data descriptive of the target datacenter and related events. For each snapshot, the data can be gathered at the respective time at 602. The gathered data includes a respective snapshot time for each snapshot. A snapshot time is the time for which the corresponding snapshot is descriptive of the target system. In many cases, the snapshot time is, at least approximately, the time at which the snapshot data was collected. Alternatively, a snapshot may be reconstructed from previously collected and time-stamped data. In such cases, the snapshot time can be considerably earlier than the collection time for the snapshot. At 603, snapshots are generated (using the gathered data) and stored in a snapshot database. At 604, a user interacts with a user interface to select at least one of: a hierarchical level for a datacenter; which overlays are to be active and which are to be inactive; and the snapshots to be compared to populate the overlays. At 605, the selected snapshots are compared to yield the overlays. At 606, the selected UI image is rendered, showing a topological or other view of the target datacenter tagged according to the selected overlays for the time interval extending between the snapshot times for the selected snapshots. The present invention provides a user interface that associates managed nodes of a datacenter with changes applicable to trouble-shooting and other management activities regarding the datacenter. Exemplary nodes can include, by way of explanation and not of limitation, servers, storage devices, network interfaces, networks, switches and other network infrastructure devices, peripherals, virtual machines, operating systems, and applications programs. Exemplary changes can include, by way of explanation and not of limitation, a fault detection, a configuration change, the submission of a problem report, the implementation of a solution, and the publication of a knowledge-base item, e.g., predicting a fault. A user may have considerable control over the user interface. For example, the user may select among time-differential parameters to be displayed. For example, the user may request that problem reports be displayed and for configuration changes not to be displayed. In addition, the user can select the beginning and end times for intervals over which changes must occur to be represented in the display. For example, the changes may be indicated for the time interval between the penultimate system snapshot and the most-recent system snapshot. Alternatively, the user can select any two earlier snapshots to be compared. Herein, a \u201csnapshot\u201d of a datacenter is a description of the state of the datacenter at a particular time. A snapshot may be taken at the time represented by the snapshot, or can be reconstructed for a past time, e.g., based on logs of configuration changes, problems, solutions, etc. Thus, a time-differential rendering may be based on pre-existing snapshots or snapshots reconstructed in response to a command to generate the time-differential display. The base representation of the datacenter can be topological, with representation of nodes connected by representations of their connections. A topological representation facilitates recognition of the relationships between nodes. Thus, for example, a communication problem might be due to one node, a node to which it is connected, or to a connection between the nodes. Recognizing these possibilities is likely to be easier with a topological view, e.g., as opposed to a tabular view with a list of components. The illustrated embodiment provides for \u201cdrilling\u201d down and up views of different hierarchical levels of a hierarchical datacenter. Generally, a computer system includes at least two hierarchical levels. A single element can represent the system as a whole, while a graph of nodes and their connections can represent a second level. In general, one can drill down a node (other than a bottom-level nodes) to view its components and their connections. The user interface can be configured in a variety of ways that affect how overlays are presented as different hierarchical levels are displayed. Tags can include graphic elements and text. In the illustrated embodiment, the overlays provide tags in the form of icons. Clicking on a tag provides a detailed explanation for the tag. In alternative embodiments, hovering over a tag can provide explanatory text. For example, a representation of a server may be tagged with an icon indicating that a problem report was issued regarding the server. Clicking on the icon directs the user to a textual description of the problem. These and other modifications to and variations upon the illustrated embodiment are provided by the invention, the scope of which is defined by the following claims.","cpc_label":"G06F111451","ipc_label":"G06F1114","filing_date":"20160101","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20170706","examiner_id":"75614.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention provides a user interface that provides such information in a visual and readily accessible manner., in the context of the novelty:  A user interface (UI) uses overlays to tag representations of datacenter components with indications of changes that have occurred over a selected time interval .

Hereinafter, the various battery layers are mentioned without use of the word \u201clayer\u201d. The thickness of each electrode may range from sub-micrometer (\u201csub-micron\u201d) to a few microns. The thickness of the separator may range from sub-micron to a few tens of microns. The stack is formed on a substrate. If one or both electrodes are not sufficiently electronically conductive, thin film current collectors (\u201cCC\u201ds) are provided to facilitate electron current flow in an external circuit. One such CC is formed on the substrate prior to the formation of the TFB stack. 3D-TFBs, as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,450 to Nathan et al., are formed inside perforations (through-holes or cavities) of a substrate as well as on any remaining original (planar) surface of the substrate. Each perforation may include a partial or full stack of concentric layers forming a \u201cconcentric microbattery\u201d or \u201cCMB\u201d. Such 3D-TFBs combine the known advantages of 2D-TFBs with an order of magnitude and more increase in power and energy per footprint (original substrate area). A general known problem with CMBs is the difficulty of forming a solid separator using wet chemistry. Also, known art does not teach electrochemical deposition of a full three layer battery stack. \u201cElectrophoresis\u201d refers to the motion of charged particles in a liquid under an applied electric field. Electrophoresis can be used to deposit materials in the form of thin films (layers), coatings and bulk products. The deposition process is commonly termed \u201celectrophoretic deposition\u201d (EPD). Reviews of EPD include those by Van der Biest and Vandeperre, Ann. Rev. Mater. Sci., 29 (1999) 327-352 and by Corni et al., J. Europ. Ceram. Soc., 28 (2008) 1353-1367. The EPD of layers faces a hurdle in the requirement that the solid to be deposited be available as a colloidal suspension or powder with grains smaller that a required layer thickness. EPD has been used to produce bulk battery electrodes, see e.g., Kanamura et al., Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 3 (2000) 259-262, and Kanamura et al., J. Power Sources, 97-98 (2001) 294-297. The use of EPD to prepare film (thick or thin) battery components has been extremely limited, and applied mainly to positive electrodes (cathodes). Structures and materials investigated include thick films of LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 [Caballero et al., J. Power Sources 158 (2005) 583-590] and relatively thin films of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 [Sugiura et al., Functional Mater. Lett. 2(1) (2009) 9-12]. A general concern and trend in the EPD of TFB electrodes it to make them dense (as opposed to porous). Electrophoretic assembly of electrochemical devices is also disclosed by Chiang et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 7,662,265. Their methods requite always use of two current collectors (\u201cterminals\u201d) for EPD of mutually repulsive electrodes, and cannot be used to EPD TFBs on a single current collector.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Embodiments disclosed herein provide methods to produce partial or full thin-film battery stacks on both planar (2D) and 3D substrates using EPD. Henceforth in this specification, the term \u201cEPDd\u201d means \u201celectrophoretically deposited\u201d. Layers of a battery stack are EPDd in sequence on a single electronically conductive substrate which can be either in bulk form or in film form. Typically, the single conductive substrate also serves as a first current collector. In some embodiments, a first polarity electrode and a separator are EPDd in sequence to form a two-layer stack, with a second, opposite polarity electrode added to complete a TFB stack. In some embodiments, a \u201cthree-layer\u201d electrode-separator-electrode battery stack is EPDd in sequence on a single current collector. In some embodiments, the separator includes an electronically insulating inorganic porous solid. As used herein, \u201cporous solid\u201d refers to a continuous solid structure having porosity of varying degrees. This definition does not inorganic solid powders dispersed in an organic matrix, where the \u201csolid\u201d phase is not continuous. Advantageously, the porous solid provides pathways for cations (e.g. protons), which lose their positive charge (reduce) on the first polarity electrode. In some embodiments, the inorganic porous solid is an oxide. In some embodiments, the inorganic porous solid is a glass-ceramic. The inventors prepared glass-ceramic powders of small enough size (diameter) for EDP of separators inside through-holes having aspect ratios (AR) of length to diameter greater than 1 and diameters of exemplarily 50 \u03bcm. Electrochemical deposition of conformal thin films of glass-ceramics inside holes with AR greater than 1, greater than 5 and even greater than 10, wherein the hole diameters are on the order of a few tens of microns, is extremely difficult. The inventors are unaware of any successful EPD of a glass-ceramic layer inside through holes, or, for that matter, on planar substrates The inventors managed to overcome significant technical difficulties in developing EDP processes for such layers. In some embodiments, the first polarity electrode is a cathode and the second polarity electrode is an anode. In some embodiments, the order of the electrodes is reversed. In some embodiments, the EPDd two-layer or three-layer structures are impregnated with an ion-conductive liquid (electrolyte). In some embodiments, the single conductive substrate is a thin-film current collector formed on a fully-perforated substrate (having through-holes as e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,450) or on a semi-perforated substrate (with non-through-holes, as e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 7,772,800). As used herein, the term \u201cthrough-hole\u201d indicates a perforation of any shape which extends between and penetrates two opposite and substantially planar surfaces bounding a substrate. Non-limiting examples of through-holes may be found in Averbuch et al., J. Power Sources, 196 (2011) 1521-1529. A TFB in which a three-layer stack is inserted in substrate holes is a \u201cfull-3D\u201d TFB. A TFB in which only two layers of a three-layer stack are inserted in substrate holes is a \u201csemi-3D\u201d TFB. In some embodiments, a separator and\/or second electrode may be EPDd on a first electrode which is formed by another method. For example, in one embodiment, a separator and\/or an anode may be EPDd on an electrodeposited CuS or MoS cathode, on both planar and 3D perforated substrates. In some embodiments, an EPDd TFB disclosed herein is a Li-ion TFB. In some embodiments of a semi-3D or full-3D EPDd Li-ion TFB, the cathode is made of a lithiated metal phosphate. In particular embodiments, the lithiated metal phosphate is LiFePO 4 (henceforth referred to as \u201cLFP\u201d). In some embodiments, the separator is in the form of a composite solid thin-film electrolyte or a composite ceramic hybrid electrolyte. In the hybrid electrolyte, ionic conductivity may be provided by impregnating an inorganic porous solid with a liquid, for example EC\/DEC 1M LiPF6. In some embodiments in which the ion-conducting electrolyte is a non-impregnated composite solid, the porous solid is sintered after the formation of the anode layer, with the goal of decreasing porosity and grain-boundary resistance. In some embodiments which provide a \u201csolid state TFB\u201d, the sintering is applied to the entire battery structure. In some embodiments, the anode includes graphite or meso-carbon micro-beads (MCMB), or nanotubes. In other embodiments, the anode includes nano-silicon. In some embodiments, the anode and\/or the cathode may be co-deposited with an electronically conducting material, such as carbon or\/and graphite powders. Particles useful in the EPD of TFB structures described herein can be in the nanometer to micrometer range. Large particles can be ball-milled to small diameters, down to submicron and even nanometer range. In some embodiments, an EPDd layer includes two or more types of different micro- and nano-sized particles. In some embodiments, the particle size is less than 10 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the particles size is less than 1 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the particle size is less than 100 nm. In some embodiments, the anode and\/or cathode powders may be pre-coated by one or more (e.g. up to 10) monolayers of carbon prior to EPD. In some embodiments, EPDd 2D-TFBs and 3D-TFBs are coated and sealed with an EPDd PEEK packaging layer. Additional polymers that can be EPDd to serve as battery packaging layer include Nylon-MXD6 (a copolymer of m-Xylyenediamine and Adipic acid), PVDC (plasticized Vinylidene Chloride copolymer) and EVOH copolymer (Ethylene Vinyl Alcohol copolymer). 2D-TFBs according to embodiments disclosed herein may be formed on large (a few square inches to a few square meters) to very large (a few tens of square meters) surfaces, which need not be flat. Such 2D-TFBs may be formed on any conductive surface or non-conductive surface coated with a conductive layer which serves as current collector\/deposition electrode. Suitable positive electrode (cathode) materials include ordered rock-salt compounds such as LiCoO 2 , LiNiO 2 , Li(Al, Ni, Mn)O 2 , LiMnO 2 , and solid solutions or doped combinations thereof; spinel structure compounds such as LiMn 2 O 4 and its doped counterparts or solid solutions with other metal oxides; ordered olivines such as LiFePO 4 , LiMnPO 4 , LiCoPO 4 , and their doped counterparts or solid solutions; and other ordered transition metal phosphates such as those of so-called Nasicon structure type and their derivatives and related structures. Suitable negative electrode (anode) materials include compounds such as graphitic or disordered carbons; metal oxides that intercalate lithium such as Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 spinel and its derivatives; and other metal oxides or their solid solutions that undergo intercalation or displacement reactions such as tin oxide, indium tin oxide, or first-row transition metal oxides; and crystalline or amorphous metals and alloys of metals or metalloids such as Si, Al, Zn, Sn, Ag, Sb, and Bi. Suitable composite ceramic hybrid electrolyte materials include ceramic powders like ZrO 2 , Zr 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , LiAlO 2 and polymer binders like PEO, polyethylenimine (PEI), polyvinyldiene fluoride (PVDF), PEG, PMMA, methylcellulose, alkyd resin, dewaxed shellac, polyvinyl butyral (PVB), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) (PDDA). The ceramic material is impregnated with a liquid electrolyte typically used for lithium-ion batteries. Exemplarily, the liquid electrolyte may be LiPF 6 :EC:DEC. Suitable inorganic solid separator materials include lithium-ion conductive glasses such as lithium zirconate, lithium aluminate, lithium silicate, LiCl\u2014Li 2 O\u2014SiO 2 \u2014P 2 O 5 , LiCl\u2014Li 2 O\u2014SiO 2 \u2014P 2 O 5 , sulfide-based glasses like Li 2 S\u2014SiS 2 \u2014Al 2 S 3 and Li 2 S\u2014SiS 2 \u2014P 2 S 5 , Li 2 S\u2014SiS 2 \u2014Li 3 N, lithiated boron oxide glasses of the family xLi 2 O\u2014B 2 O 3 and lithium ion conducting glass ceramics like Li 2 O\u2014Al 2 O 3 \u2014SiO 2 \u2014P 2 O 5 \u2014TiO 2 \u2014GeO 2 and Li 2 O\u2014Al 2 O 3 \u2014SiO 2 \u2014P 2 O 5 \u2014T 2 O 2 . The solid electrolyte layers are preferably 1 to 10 \u03bcm thick to eliminate high ohmic resistance at RT. Alternatively, they can be thicker than about 10 \u03bcm if used at elevated temperatures (such as 60-70 C). Suitable solvents for use in the EPD of various materials may be found for example in Table 3 of L. Besra and M. Liu, Progress in Materials Science, 52 (2007) 1-61. The electrophoretic deposition may be enhanced by use of additives. Useful additives include but are not limited to conductive particles that increase the electrical conductivity of the deposited material, such as conductive carbon, metallic particles, or conductive polymer dispersions, or binders that improve the adherence of the deposited particles to each other or to a current collector. Other exemplary additives which may be used for this purpose are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7,662,265.","description":"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a Continuation application from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/988,337 filed May 19, 2013 (now allowed) which was a National Phase application of PCT patent application PCT\/IB2011\/002916, and is related to and hereby claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/419,855 titled \u201cElectrophoretic deposition of thin film energy storage devices\u201d filed Dec. 5, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD Embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to energy storage devices and more particularly to electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of thin film batteries (TFBs) in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. BACKGROUND TFBs comprise a \u201cstack\u201d of two, one negative (\u201canode\u201d) and one positive (\u201ccathode\u201d) thin-film active material electrode layers (referred to henceforth simply as \u201celectrodes\u201d) separated by an ionically conducting and electronically insulating (\u201cnon-conducting\u201d) separator layer. Hereinafter, the various battery layers are mentioned without use of the word \u201clayer\u201d. The thickness of each electrode may range from sub-micrometer (\u201csub-micron\u201d) to a few microns. The thickness of the separator may range from sub-micron to a few tens of microns. The stack is formed on a substrate. If one or both electrodes are not sufficiently electronically conductive, thin film current collectors (\u201cCC\u201ds) are provided to facilitate electron current flow in an external circuit. One such CC is formed on the substrate prior to the formation of the TFB stack. 3D-TFBs, as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,450 to Nathan et al., are formed inside perforations (through-holes or cavities) of a substrate as well as on any remaining original (planar) surface of the substrate. Each perforation may include a partial or full stack of concentric layers forming a \u201cconcentric microbattery\u201d or \u201cCMB\u201d. Such 3D-TFBs combine the known advantages of 2D-TFBs with an order of magnitude and more increase in power and energy per footprint (original substrate area). A general known problem with CMBs is the difficulty of forming a solid separator using wet chemistry. Also, known art does not teach electrochemical deposition of a full three layer battery stack. \u201cElectrophoresis\u201d refers to the motion of charged particles in a liquid under an applied electric field. Electrophoresis can be used to deposit materials in the form of thin films (layers), coatings and bulk products. The deposition process is commonly termed \u201celectrophoretic deposition\u201d (EPD). Reviews of EPD include those by Van der Biest and Vandeperre, Ann. Rev. Mater. Sci., 29 (1999) 327-352 and by Corni et al., J. Europ. Ceram. Soc., 28 (2008) 1353-1367. The EPD of layers faces a hurdle in the requirement that the solid to be deposited be available as a colloidal suspension or powder with grains smaller that a required layer thickness. EPD has been used to produce bulk battery electrodes, see e.g., Kanamura et al., Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 3 (2000) 259-262, and Kanamura et al., J. Power Sources, 97-98 (2001) 294-297. The use of EPD to prepare film (thick or thin) battery components has been extremely limited, and applied mainly to positive electrodes (cathodes). Structures and materials investigated include thick films of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 [Caballero et al., J. Power Sources 158 (2005) 583-590] and relatively thin films of Li4Ti5O12 [Sugiura et al., Functional Mater. Lett. 2(1) (2009) 9-12]. A general concern and trend in the EPD of TFB electrodes it to make them dense (as opposed to porous). Electrophoretic assembly of electrochemical devices is also disclosed by Chiang et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 7,662,265. Their methods requite always use of two current collectors (\u201cterminals\u201d) for EPD of mutually repulsive electrodes, and cannot be used to EPD TFBs on a single current collector. SUMMARY Embodiments disclosed herein provide methods to produce partial or full thin-film battery stacks on both planar (2D) and 3D substrates using EPD. Henceforth in this specification, the term \u201cEPDd\u201d means \u201celectrophoretically deposited\u201d. Layers of a battery stack are EPDd in sequence on a single electronically conductive substrate which can be either in bulk form or in film form. Typically, the single conductive substrate also serves as a first current collector. In some embodiments, a first polarity electrode and a separator are EPDd in sequence to form a two-layer stack, with a second, opposite polarity electrode added to complete a TFB stack. In some embodiments, a \u201cthree-layer\u201d electrode-separator-electrode battery stack is EPDd in sequence on a single current collector. In some embodiments, the separator includes an electronically insulating inorganic porous solid. As used herein, \u201cporous solid\u201d refers to a continuous solid structure having porosity of varying degrees. This definition does not inorganic solid powders dispersed in an organic matrix, where the \u201csolid\u201d phase is not continuous. Advantageously, the porous solid provides pathways for cations (e.g. protons), which lose their positive charge (reduce) on the first polarity electrode. In some embodiments, the inorganic porous solid is an oxide. In some embodiments, the inorganic porous solid is a glass-ceramic. The inventors prepared glass-ceramic powders of small enough size (diameter) for EDP of separators inside through-holes having aspect ratios (AR) of length to diameter greater than 1 and diameters of exemplarily 50 \u03bcm. Electrochemical deposition of conformal thin films of glass-ceramics inside holes with AR greater than 1, greater than 5 and even greater than 10, wherein the hole diameters are on the order of a few tens of microns, is extremely difficult. The inventors are unaware of any successful EPD of a glass-ceramic layer inside through holes, or, for that matter, on planar substrates The inventors managed to overcome significant technical difficulties in developing EDP processes for such layers. In some embodiments, the first polarity electrode is a cathode and the second polarity electrode is an anode. In some embodiments, the order of the electrodes is reversed. In some embodiments, the EPDd two-layer or three-layer structures are impregnated with an ion-conductive liquid (electrolyte). In some embodiments, the single conductive substrate is a thin-film current collector formed on a fully-perforated substrate (having through-holes as e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,450) or on a semi-perforated substrate (with non-through-holes, as e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 7,772,800). As used herein, the term \u201cthrough-hole\u201d indicates a perforation of any shape which extends between and penetrates two opposite and substantially planar surfaces bounding a substrate. Non-limiting examples of through-holes may be found in Averbuch et al., J. Power Sources, 196 (2011) 1521-1529. A TFB in which a three-layer stack is inserted in substrate holes is a \u201cfull-3D\u201d TFB. A TFB in which only two layers of a three-layer stack are inserted in substrate holes is a \u201csemi-3D\u201d TFB. In some embodiments, a separator and\/or second electrode may be EPDd on a first electrode which is formed by another method. For example, in one embodiment, a separator and\/or an anode may be EPDd on an electrodeposited CuS or MoS cathode, on both planar and 3D perforated substrates. In some embodiments, an EPDd TFB disclosed herein is a Li-ion TFB. In some embodiments of a semi-3D or full-3D EPDd Li-ion TFB, the cathode is made of a lithiated metal phosphate. In particular embodiments, the lithiated metal phosphate is LiFePO4 (henceforth referred to as \u201cLFP\u201d). In some embodiments, the separator is in the form of a composite solid thin-film electrolyte or a composite ceramic hybrid electrolyte. In the hybrid electrolyte, ionic conductivity may be provided by impregnating an inorganic porous solid with a liquid, for example EC\/DEC 1M LiPF6. In some embodiments in which the ion-conducting electrolyte is a non-impregnated composite solid, the porous solid is sintered after the formation of the anode layer, with the goal of decreasing porosity and grain-boundary resistance. In some embodiments which provide a \u201csolid state TFB\u201d, the sintering is applied to the entire battery structure. In some embodiments, the anode includes graphite or meso-carbon micro-beads (MCMB), or nanotubes. In other embodiments, the anode includes nano-silicon. In some embodiments, the anode and\/or the cathode may be co-deposited with an electronically conducting material, such as carbon or\/and graphite powders. Particles useful in the EPD of TFB structures described herein can be in the nanometer to micrometer range. Large particles can be ball-milled to small diameters, down to submicron and even nanometer range. In some embodiments, an EPDd layer includes two or more types of different micro- and nano-sized particles. In some embodiments, the particle size is less than 10 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the particles size is less than 1 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the particle size is less than 100 nm. In some embodiments, the anode and\/or cathode powders may be pre-coated by one or more (e.g. up to 10) monolayers of carbon prior to EPD. In some embodiments, EPDd 2D-TFBs and 3D-TFBs are coated and sealed with an EPDd PEEK packaging layer. Additional polymers that can be EPDd to serve as battery packaging layer include Nylon-MXD6 (a copolymer of m-Xylyenediamine and Adipic acid), PVDC (plasticized Vinylidene Chloride copolymer) and EVOH copolymer (Ethylene Vinyl Alcohol copolymer). 2D-TFBs according to embodiments disclosed herein may be formed on large (a few square inches to a few square meters) to very large (a few tens of square meters) surfaces, which need not be flat. Such 2D-TFBs may be formed on any conductive surface or non-conductive surface coated with a conductive layer which serves as current collector\/deposition electrode. Suitable positive electrode (cathode) materials include ordered rock-salt compounds such as LiCoO2, LiNiO2, Li(Al, Ni, Mn)O2, LiMnO2, and solid solutions or doped combinations thereof; spinel structure compounds such as LiMn2O4 and its doped counterparts or solid solutions with other metal oxides; ordered olivines such as LiFePO4, LiMnPO4, LiCoPO4, and their doped counterparts or solid solutions; and other ordered transition metal phosphates such as those of so-called Nasicon structure type and their derivatives and related structures. Suitable negative electrode (anode) materials include compounds such as graphitic or disordered carbons; metal oxides that intercalate lithium such as Li4Ti5O12 spinel and its derivatives; and other metal oxides or their solid solutions that undergo intercalation or displacement reactions such as tin oxide, indium tin oxide, or first-row transition metal oxides; and crystalline or amorphous metals and alloys of metals or metalloids such as Si, Al, Zn, Sn, Ag, Sb, and Bi. Suitable composite ceramic hybrid electrolyte materials include ceramic powders like ZrO2, Zr2O3, SiO2, Al2O3, LiAlO2 and polymer binders like PEO, polyethylenimine (PEI), polyvinyldiene fluoride (PVDF), PEG, PMMA, methylcellulose, alkyd resin, dewaxed shellac, polyvinyl butyral (PVB), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) (PDDA). The ceramic material is impregnated with a liquid electrolyte typically used for lithium-ion batteries. Exemplarily, the liquid electrolyte may be LiPF6:EC:DEC. Suitable inorganic solid separator materials include lithium-ion conductive glasses such as lithium zirconate, lithium aluminate, lithium silicate, LiCl\u2014Li2O\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5, LiCl\u2014Li2O\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5, sulfide-based glasses like Li2S\u2014SiS2\u2014Al2S3 and Li2S\u2014SiS2\u2014P2S5, Li2S\u2014SiS2\u2014Li3N, lithiated boron oxide glasses of the family xLi2O\u2014B2O3 and lithium ion conducting glass ceramics like Li2O\u2014Al2O3\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5\u2014TiO2\u2014GeO2 and Li2O\u2014Al2O3\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5\u2014T2O2. The solid electrolyte layers are preferably 1 to 10 \u03bcm thick to eliminate high ohmic resistance at RT. Alternatively, they can be thicker than about 10 \u03bcm if used at elevated temperatures (such as 60-70 C). Suitable solvents for use in the EPD of various materials may be found for example in Table 3 of L. Besra and M. Liu, Progress in Materials Science, 52 (2007) 1-61. The electrophoretic deposition may be enhanced by use of additives. Useful additives include but are not limited to conductive particles that increase the electrical conductivity of the deposited material, such as conductive carbon, metallic particles, or conductive polymer dispersions, or binders that improve the adherence of the deposited particles to each other or to a current collector. Other exemplary additives which may be used for this purpose are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7,662,265.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The inventors found surprisingly that three-layer (first electrode\/separator\/second electrode) thin film battery stacks can be EPDd in sequence on a single conductive substrate in both 2D and 3D configurations. The conductive substrate may be a metal or a thin-film current collector deposited on a non-conducting substrate (e.g. plastic or glass) or on a semiconductor substrate (like silicon). In some embodiments, an electrode may be electrically conductive enough to serve as current collector. If necessary, a second current collector is provided to form a full energy storage cell, which can be packaged in various packages. In some embodiments, the separator includes an inorganic porous solid, which, as mentioned, provides pathways for cations which reduce on the first EPDd electrode. Its porosity depends on the deposition conditions and may vary from 20-80%. In some embodiments, the porous solid is impregnated with an ion-conductive electrolyte to provide a \u201ccomposite ceramic electrolyte\u201d. Exemplarily, the electrolyte may be LiPF6:EC:DEC with a 2% volume VC (vinylene carbonate) solution, or a N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PYR13TFSI) RT ionic liquid (IL) and LiTFSI salt. The impregnation is carried out after the deposition of the entire battery stack. In other embodiments, the separator is a composite solid thin-film electrolyte which includes Li ion conducting, but electronically non-conducting crystalline materials (such as oxide perovskites, La0.5Li0.5TiO3, thio-LISICON, Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4, glass-ceramics, glassy materials (e.g. Li2S\u2014SiS2\u2014Li3PO4), Li10GeP2S12, lithium sulfide, lithium iodide, lithium nitride and\/or a mixture thereof. In particular, a wide variety of glass ceramic systems useful as ion-conducting separators exist, for example the Li2O x Al2O3x nSiO2-system (LAS-system), the MgO x Al2O3 x nSiO12-system (MAS-system) and the ZnO x Al2O3 x nSiO2-System (ZAS-system). Note that after EPD, all separators are porous (i.e. include a porous solid) in order to enable further EPD of a second electrode. The porosity of a Li-ion conducting solid separator may be reduced significantly by additional sintering. The EPDd first electrode can serve as a deposition electrode for the EPD of an electronically insulating and ionically conducting separator. Unexpectedly and advantageously, the first electrode\/separator stack was found able to serve as a deposition electrode in the EPD of the second electrode. This is enabled by the porosity of the separator solid, which allows cation (proton) motion to the first electrode. In some embodiments, the porous separator was EPDd as a conformal layer on a first electrode previously EPDd inside holes of a perforated substrate. Thus, previously unachievable and unknown conformal separators which include a porous solid could be obtained for semi-3D and full-3D TFB configurations (i.e. CMBs) inside perforated substrates. Even more surprisingly, the inventors found that the second electrode could be EPDd as a conformal layer over the conformal separator above, i.e. all three layers could be EPDd in sequence inside perforations. That is, concentric microbatteries (CMBs) inside holes could be formed entirely by EPD. In some embodiments, the inventors found that the porous separator EPDd inside holes could be sintered and used for ionic conduction without impregnation by an ionically conducting liquid. The following examples illustrate the sequential EPD of two-layer and three-layer TFB stacks on a single conductive substrate in both 2D and 3D configurations, and 2D-TFBs and 3D-TFBs obtained by EPD. Example 1 Two-Layer LiFePO4\/ZrO2 (8% Y2O3)2Stack on a Planar Substrate A two-layer LFP\/ZrO2 (8% Y2O3) stack was prepared by EPD on a planar substrate. ZrO2 (8% Y2O3) will be referred to henceforth as \u201cYSZ\u201d. FIG. 1 shows a low magnification SEM view of the YSZ layer, having a porosity of between 40-50%. FIG. 2 shows high-resolution SEM images of the same layer at different magnifications. LFP powder (Hydro Quebec, Canada), black-pearl carbon (BP) and PVDF were dispersed in an acetone solution with 0.28 mg\/L. The weight percentage ratio of LFP:BP:PVDF was (91:4:5%). In one case, 0.4% v\/v polymer triton-X 100 (TTX, (C14H22O(C2H4O)n)) was added to the dispersion. Black-pearl carbon and PVDF were used as conducting and binding materials, respectively. The modification of the film with TTX caused smoother and more homogeneous deposition during the EPD process. The addition of iodine produces charged particles (protons) in the solution through chemical reaction of I2 with acetone. The reaction may be written as follows: CH3COCH3CH3C(OH)CH2 CH3C(OH)CH2+I2\u2192CH3COCH2I+H++I\u2212 A nickel disk was used as a substrate (working electrode) and a graphite plate was used as a counter electrode. The constant voltage applied between the two electrodes was set at 60V for 60 seconds. The mass of the EPDd LFP deposit was 9 mg. The YSZ membrane was prepared by cathodic EPD on the LFP cathode (which served as working electrode), using a deposition bath with the following composition: 250 ml Ethanol, 0.7 gr YSZ, 4 ml Acetone, 2 ml water, 0.4 ml Acetylacetone, 0.027 gr Iodine and 0.0105 gr PEI (PolyEthylene Imine). As before, the graphite plate served as counter electrode. The working distance between the electrodes was 15 mm. The deposition solution preparation was carried in two steps: preparation of solution 1 containing 150 ml Ethanol, 0.4 ml Acetylacetone and 0.7 gr YSZ in one container and stirring overnight; and preparation of solution 2 containing 100 ml Ethanol, 2 ml de-ionized water, 4 ml acetone and 0.027 gr iodine and stirring for a few minutes. Solutions 1 and 2 where then mixed and placed in an ultrasonic bath. EPD was carried out at room temperature (RT) and atmospheric conditions using a Keithley 2400 source-meter. The addition of iodine produced protons in the solution, as explained above. Some of the protons were adsorbed on the ZrO2 particles, rendering them positively charged. The addition of PEI to the solution helped to obtain a smoother, adherent film. The YSZ deposition was carried out at a constant current of 1.6 mA\/cm2 for 10 minutes, and resulted in a highly adherent conformal deposit on the LFP cathode. A LFP cathode\/YSZ-PEI assembly EPDd as above was tested in a coin cell configuration, with a Li foil serving as anode. The YSZ-PEI membrane was impregnated with LiPF6:EC:DEC electrolyte with an added 2% volume VC solution. The VC solution improves solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) properties. The configuration was sealed in a stainless steel coin cell. The Li\/YSZ\/LFP cells were cycled at RT using a Maccor series 2000 battery test system. Charge-discharge curves and cycling results are shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. The voltage cut-off was 2.8 to 3.5V, with a charge\/discharge at a current density of 75 \u03bcA\/cm2. The cells provided 0.1-0.2 mAh\/cm2 capacity for more than 50 reversible cycles. The Faradaic efficiency was close to 100%. Example 2 Two-layer LiFePO4\/LiAlO2 Stack on a Planar Substrate A two-layer LFP\/LiAlO2 stack was prepared by EPD on a Ni planar current collector substrate. First, the LFP cathode was deposited as in Example 1. The LiAlO2 membrane was then deposited by cathodic EPD on the LFP, using a deposition bath with the following composition: 250 ml Ethanol, 0.7 gr LiAlO2, 4 ml Acetone, 2 ml water, 0.4 m1 Acetylacetone, 0.027 gr Iodine and 0.0105 gr PEI. The deposition solution preparation was carried in two steps: preparation of solution 1 containing 150 ml Ethanol, 0.5 m1 Acetylacetone and 0.8 gr LiAlO2 in one container with overnight stirring, and preparation of solution 2 containing 100 ml Ethanol, 3 ml deionized water, 4.5 ml acetone and 0.035 gr iodine with stirring for a few minutes. Solutions 1 and 2 where then mixed and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 20 minutes. 0.0105 gr of PEI was then added to the mixed solution. The EPD of LiAlO2 was carried out at RT under atmospheric conditions using a Keithley 2400 source-meter, with the LFP as working electrode and a graphite plate distanced 15 mm therefrom as counter electrode. The LiAlO2 EPD was carried out at a constant current of 1.6 mA\/cm2 for 10 minutes. The result was a highly adherent conformal LiAlO2 deposit. LiImide:PEG500 electrolyte was then dripped onto the surface of the LiAlO2 and the materials dried. The two-layer LiFePO4\/LiAlO2 stack was soaked in LiImide:PEG500 liquid electrolyte under vacuum for 30 min and left overnight in the solution. An assembly of EPDd LFP cathode\/LiAlO2-LiImide:PEG500 was tested in a coin cell configuration with a Li foil serving as anode. The configuration was sealed in a stainless steel coin cell. The Li\/LiAlO2\/LFP cells were cycled at RT using a Maccor series 2000 battery test system and exhibited the typical behavior of a Li TFB. Example 3 Two-Layer MCMB\/YSZ Stack on a Planar Substrate A MCMB anode was deposited by cathodic EPD on a Ni current collector using a deposition bath with the following composition: 250 ml Ethanol, 0.9 gr MCMB, 4.5 ml Acetone, 2 ml water, 0.5 ml Acetylacetone, 0.05 gr Iodine and 0.008 gr PEI. The deposition solution preparation was carried in two steps: preparation of solution 1 containing 150 ml Ethanol, 0.4 ml Acetylacetone and 0.7 gr MCMB in one container with stirring for a few minutes; and preparation of solution 2 containing 100 ml Ethanol, 2 ml deionized water, 4 ml Acetone and 0.05 gr Iodine with stirring for a few minutes. Solutions 1 and 2 where then mixed and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 20 minutes. 0.007 gr of PEI was then added to the solution. EPD was carried out using the Keithley 2400 source-meter at RT under atmospheric conditions, at a constant voltage of 100V for 120 seconds. The YSZ separator layer was prepared as in Example 1, providing a highly adherent conformal deposit on the MCMB. The resulting membrane structure is shown in FIG. 4A. FIG. 4B shows SEM images of two-layer MCMB-membrane stack with a YSZ-PEI membrane EPDd from an acidic suspension (pH 2) containing 10% PEI. The YSZ-PEI deposition was performed at 200V using 5-10 pulses of 10 s each. Lowering of the pH enabled using a solution without iodide for EPD. Example 4 Two-Layer MCMB\/LiAlO2 Stack on Planar Substrate A MCMB anode was deposited by cathodic EPD on a Ni current collector as in Example 3. A LiAlO2 membrane was deposited on the MCMB anode using the electrolyte described in Example 2. 10% (v\/v) PEGDME was added to the suspension. The membrane was deposited by pulse potential cathodic EPD. The applied voltage was 100V and the deposition was carried out stepwise. The duration of each step was 30 sec. Between the deposition steps, the sample was removed from the suspension and dried under ambient conditions until complete evaporation of the solvent. FIG. 5 shows SEM views of LiAlO2-based membranes deposited by EPD from suspensions containing two different concentrations (15% and 50%) of PEG-polymer binder. A wide concentration range of polymer can be used in the suspension. Better uniformity and porosity can be achieved when the suspension contains 15% PEG. TGA tests indicated that the polymer concentration in the EPD layers did not exceed 3.5-5.5%. An assembly of EPDd MCMB anode\/LiAlO2-PEG with LiPF6:EC:DEC 2% VC was tested in a coin cell configuration with a Li foil serving as counter electrode. The configuration was sealed in a stainless steel coin cell. FIG. 6A shows a discharge curve of the Li\/LiAlO2-15% PEG\/MCMB cell. FIG. 6B shows cyclability data for this cell. The comparison of the cell voltage profile with that of a similar cell including a commercial Celgard membrane proves the feasibility of using the disclosed membrane for Li-ion cells. Example 5 Three-Layer LiFePO4\/YSZ\/MCMB Stack on Planar Substrate A three-layer LFP\/YSZ\/MCMB stack was prepared by EPD on a planar Ni current collector. All three layers were EPDd in sequence on the single Ni current collector. The cathode and separator layers were EPDd as in Example 1. The MCMB anode was subsequently deposited by cathodic EPD on the YSZ using a deposition bath described in Example 3. The Ni\/LFP\/YSZ assembly was used as working electrode and a graphite plate was used as a counter electrode, with a working distance of 15 mm between the electrodes. The inventors found that unexpectedly, while YSZ is an electronically non-conductive separator, its high porosity (here ca. 60%) enables high proton mobility inside pores and hydrogen evolution reaction on the electronically conducting Ni\/LFP surface, assisting the EPD of the MCMB layer. The MCMB is electronically conductive enough to also serve as an anode current collector. FIG. 7 shows a cross section of the EPDd three-layer LFP\/YSZ\/MCMB stack. One can get a rough measure of both layer thicknesses and layer porosities. Here, the separator thickness is roughly 110-120 \u03bcm, the thickness of the MCMB anode is roughly 80-90 \u03bcm and the thickness of the cathode LFP is roughly 70-80 \u03bcm. In general, the thickness of each layer can be controlled by (among others) controlling the deposition time, and can be made much thinner. Specifically, the YSZ separator may be made thinner than 10 \u03bcm, thinner than 5 \u03bcm and even thinner than 2 \u03bcm. Example 6 Two-Layer LiFePO4\/YSZ Stack on Perforated (3D) Substrate A two-layer LFP\/YSZ stack was prepared by EPD on a 3D perforated substrate which had a previously electrolessly deposited thin (1-2 \u03bcm) Au layer on all available surfaces. A tilted SEM picture of the stack is shown in FIG. 8. The two-layer LFP\/YSZ stack was EPDd inside 50 \u03bcm diameter holes in a 500 \u03bcm thick silicon substrate as well as on all remaining planar surfaces. The hole aspect ratio (length\/diameter) was 10:1. The preparation of the solution and deposition of the LFP were performed as in Example 1, except that two graphite plate counter electrodes were positioned in parallel, one on each side of the Si substrate, each at a distance of ca. 15 mm from a respective surface of the Si. The preparation of the solution and the deposition of the YSZ layer were also performed as in Example 1. The thickness of the separator so formed was about 10 \u03bcm. The 3D LFP\/YSZ stack was tested in a coin cell configuration with a Li foil serving as anode. This configuration forms a so-called \u201csemi-3D\u201d TFB. The Li foil was brought into an intimate contact with the YSZ on the top surface of the substrate. The electrolyte was LiPF6:EC:DEC with a 2% volume VC solution. The configuration was sealed in a stainless steel coin cell. The Li\/YSZ\/LFP cells were tested at RT using a Maccor series 2000 battery test system. A stable OCV of 3.6V was measured. The testing proved that the assembly performs as a Li battery. Example 7 Three-Layer LiFePO4\/YSZ\/MCMB Stack on Perforated (3D) Substrate A three-layer LFP\/YSZ\/MCMB stack was prepared by EPD on a 3D perforated substrate. First, a LFP\/YSZ stack was prepared on a Ni coated Si perforated substrate as in Example 1. Two graphite plate counter electrodes were positioned in parallel, one on each side of the Si substrate, each at a distance of ca. 15 mm from a respective surface of the Si. A MCMB anode was subsequently deposited by cathodic EPD on the YSZ as in Example 3. The MCMB was electronically conductive enough to also serve as anode current collector. The resulting structure was one of a concentric electrode\/separator\/electrode stack formed in each hole in the perforated substrate and also formed on the remaining planar surfaces of the substrate. This configuration forms a so-called \u201cfull-3D\u201d TFB. Example 8 Improvement of LiFePO4 Conductivity A topcoat material with high mixed electron\/ion conductivity (exemplarily copper sulfide (CuS)) was used to improve the conductivity of composite LFP electrodes prepared by EPD. CuS was electrochemically synthesized on the EPDd LFP cathode with the use of procedure described in H. Mazor et al., Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 12, (2009), A232-A235. The CuS was deposited on both 2D and 3D Si substrates over the LFP. Planar and semi-3D cells comprising an Au cathode current collector, an EPDd LFP cathode modified by CuS layer, a Celgard separator soaked in commercial electrolyte (LiPF6 in 1:1 EC:DEC) and a lithium anode were assembled and tested. As shown in FIG. 9A, a semi-3D cell exhibited a 1.5-2.3 mAhcm\u22122 (per battery footprint) reversible capacity. The capacity values were stable for 100 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.01% capacity loss per cycle. The capacity of the planar cell was 10 times lower. This agrees with the geometrical-area gain (AG=9) of the perforated Si substrate. FIG. 9B shows polarization curves of 2D and semi-3D cells with EPDd LFP cathode modified by CuS. Both cathodes were deposited under similar conditions and both contained LFP, black-pearl carbon, PVDF binder (ratio 91:4:5%(w\/w)) and TTX-100. The pulse duration was one second followed by a rest period of 20 seconds. As can be seen from the graph, the transition from 2D to 3D architecture is followed by an increase in maximum current-density capability from 30 to 75 mAcm\u22122. The semi-3D cells with CuS-coated modified LFP electrodes were able to provide more than 85 mAcm\u22122 current density and 204 mWcm\u22122 peak power per battery footprint, a 24% increase over the semi-3D non-CuS coated LFP cell and a significant enhancement in comparison with the 2D LFP cell. Example 9 Three-Layer LiFePO4\/Li2O\u2014Al2O3\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5\u2014TiO2\/MCMB Stack on Planar Substrate A 3-layer planar LFP\/Li2O\u2014Al2O3\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5\u2014TiO2\/MCMB structure with solid electrolyte was EPDd on a single Ni current collector. The LFP layer was deposited as in Example 1. The Li2O\u2014Al2O3\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5\u2014TiO2 is a glass-ceramic available commercially in powder form from OHARA Ltd, and described exemplarily in US patent application 20080289365. The powder was ball-milled for 24 hours before preparation of the suspension for EPD. The Li2O\u2014Al2O3\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5\u2014TiO2 was then EPDd under the same conditions as the LiAlO2 in the Example 2. The MCMB anode was then EPDd as in Example 3 on the LFP\/glass-ceramic stack. Example 10 Three-Layer MCMB\/LiAlO2\/LFP Stack on Perforated Si Substrate Coated by Ni Current Collector A MCMB anode was deposited by cathodic EPD on a 3D-perforated Si substrate coated by Ni current collector. The thickness of nickel layer was 5 \u03bcm to eliminate co-intercalation of lithium to the silicon substrate trough pits of Ni. A MCMB anode was deposited as in Example 3. A LiAlO2 membrane was deposited on the MCMB anode using the electrolyte described in Examples 2 and 4. The LFP cathode was EPDd on the LiAlO2 membrane-PEG membrane using the procedure described for LFP in the Example 1. A 3D-assembly of EPDd MCMB anode\/LiAlO2-PEG\/LFP with impregnated LiPF6:EC:DEC 2% VC was tested in a coin cell configuration. The configuration was sealed in a stainless steel coin cell. Example 11 EPD of PEEK Protective and Pre-Packaging Layer A polyaromatic, semicrystalline thermoplastic polymer, Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), (\u2014C6H4\u2014O\u2014C6H4\u2014O\u2014C6H4\u2014CO\u2014)n, was electrophoretically deposited on the LFP\/Li2O\u2014Al2O3\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5\u2014TiO2\/MCMB structure prepared as in Example 9. A Ni coated substrate was placed in the EPD bath as a cathode between two graphite plates connected to the anode CC. PEEK suspensions were prepared by magnetic stirring of 2 g PEEK powder (Victrex, UK) in 250 mL ethanol. The stirring was conducted for 3 hours, followed by 30 min ultrasonic treatment. The suspension was mixed with the second bath containing 4 ml Acetone, 2 ml water, 0.5 ml Acetylacetone and 0.04 gr Iodine. An additional 30 min ultrasonic treatment was then carried out. A small area surrounding the current collector contacts was shielded. PEEK EPD was carried our at an applied voltage was 140V stepwise with 30 sec per step. The as-deposited PEEK layer was porous. The final PEEK\/Ni\/LFP\/Li2O\u2014Al2O3\u2014SiO2\u2014P2O5\u2014TiO2\/MCMB\/PEEK structure was dried in vacuum at 100 C for 7 hours. After drying, the sample was heated at 350 C for 20 minutes to provide a dense PEEK polymer coating, which serves as a protective and pre-packaging layer of the battery to eliminate penetration of moisture and oxygen.

For example, in some laparoscopic surgical procedures, it is necessary to create an anastomosis by joining, e.g., separated parts of the intestines, and this is usually accomplished by joining the separated parts together by means of a surgical stapler. In some instances, this technique of creation of anastomosis (a connection between intestines or stomach and intestines) is performed on obese subjects with extremely thick abdominal wall. During such a laparoscopic procedure, it is difficult to insert the surgical stapler and\/or stapler anvil through the laparoscopic incision or opening made in the abdominal or body wall in order to enable the stapler or anvil to be subsequently manipulated to the area in which it is needed to staple the body parts together. The difficulty stems from high resistance of the various layers of the abdominal wall to penetration. In particular, since the size of surgical staplers and anvils varies, the laparoscopic incision might not be large enough for the particular stapler or anvil being used. Moreover, all current staplers and anvils usually have a blunt and flat forward end, which makes it difficult to introduce them easily through the opening in the body wall because of increased resistance of the tissues. An additional problem with the insertion of staplers through an opening in the body wall is that fragments of the tissues around the opening in the body wall can become disconnected from the surrounding tissue and subsequently lodged in the open end of the stapler and cause a subsequent malfunction of the stapling mechanism in the stapler with unfavorable consequences to the patient.","summary":"<SOH> OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new device and method for facilitating the insertion of a surgical instrument into the body through an opening in the body wall as well as to protect a delicate mechanism of the stapling device from damage during introduction process as well as to protect human tissue from excessive damage during introduction of the stapler. The invention is particularly useful for facilitating the insertion of blunt surgical instruments, such as a surgical stapler or stapler anvil, into the body through an opening in the body wall. It is another object of the present invention to provide a new device and method for facilitating the passage of a surgical instrument through a small opening in the abdominal wall, which temporarily and gently spreads the tissues around the opening during passage of the surgical instrument there through. In this manner, a surgical instrument that is much larger than the size of the opening can be effectively inserted through the opening using the spreading motion of the device.

The position of the opening to accommodate the suture is designed for automatic leveling of the member during extraction process so that no additional devices are necessary to extract the device from the abdominal cavity once its function is completed. The member and cavity can be dimensioned to accommodate different surgical instruments, including but not limited to circular surgical staplers and stapler anvils. The cavity is dimensioned in such way that it accommodates the end of the stapler and allows effortless disconnect of the device from the stapler once inside the abdominal cavity.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to devices and methods for enabling the percutaneous (through layers of skin) or trans abdominal (through all or some layers of the abdominal wall) introduction of surgical instruments into the human body to perform specific surgical interventions on the organs located internally and more particularly to devices and methods for introducing blunt surgical instruments, such as a surgical circular stapler or stapler anvil (part of the stapler used to perform coupling of the tissues), through the body wall, for example, during intra-corporeal creation of a surgical anastomoses in laparoscopic or endoscopic surgical procedures, BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In a variety of surgical procedures, it is necessary to use a surgical stapler to staple separated internal parts of the body together. For example, in some laparoscopic surgical procedures, it is necessary to create an anastomosis by joining, e.g., separated parts of the intestines, and this is usually accomplished by joining the separated parts together by means of a surgical stapler.

In order to achieve the above objectives and other objectives, a device for facilitating insertion of a surgical instrument into a human body through an opening in a body wall in accordance with the invention includes a cone-shaped member having a rounded front end, an internal cavity extending inward from a rear edge and a through opening arranged at the front end. The cavity is dimensioned such that at least a part of the surgical instrument is received therein. During use, the surgical instrument, after insertion into the cavity of the member, is inserted into the body through the opening in the body wall by urging the member through the opening with its front end forward and thereby causing tissue surrounding the opening to spread outward as the member passes through the body wall. The instrument is separated from the member after insertion of the member and the instrument into the body. The member and\/or instrument can be removed from the body through same opening through which it was inserted into the body by pulling on the attached suture, which is fashioned through the opening in the front end of the member.

The disconnect process is accomplished either by utilization of a standard surgical instrument to grasp and pull on the suture attached to the end of the device or by a rapid pull of the surgical stapler in a backward motion which dislodges the device by forces of inertia. The through hole is used to enable removal of the member from the body once the instrument is situated in the body. This is achieved by inserting a suture thread, or any human-compatible thread, through the through opening and tying its ends together to form a loop. A part of the loop is maintained outside of the body during the insertion of the member into the body, and then after the instrument is removed from the cavity, the thread outside of the body is grasped and pulled to remove the member from the body. The member is removed from the body with its front end forward. The suture is also used to remove the member from the surgical stapler once inside the abdominal cavity. A method for introducing a surgical instrument into a body through an opening in a body wall in accordance with the invention entails inserting at least a part of the instrument into a cavity formed in a rear of a cone-shaped member having a rounded front end, inserting the member with the instrument at least partially inserted therein into the body through the opening in the body wall with its front end forward and then separating the instrument from the member after the member and instrument are inserted into the body.

FIG. 8 is a view showing the coupling of a surgical stapler anvil and the device in accordance with the invention in a state in which it is ready for insertion into the body. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to the same or similar elements, the device for enabling introduction of surgical instruments in accordance with the invention is designated generally as 10 and has the general shape of a cone or bullet with a rounded front end 12 and arcuate side surfaces 14. An internal cavity 16 extends inward from a rear edge 18 of the device 10 (see FIGS. 2 and 3) and is designed to accommodate at least part of a surgical instrument to be introduced into the body, such as a surgical stapler or stapler anvil. Cavity 16 may have a generally uniform cross-sectional shape and a substantially planar front wall 20 substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the device 16. Thus, one form of the cavity 16 may be substantially cylindrical. A through hole 22 with flanged opening is formed at the front end 12 of the device 10 to enable suture thread 24 to be passed there through, the purpose of which is explained below. The diameter of the through hole 22 may be selected as desired for particularly sized devices 10 and\/or suture threads 24. The through hole 22 preferably defines an axis which is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the device 10 such that pulling of the thread 24 results in an even application 5 offered to the device 10 which is beneficial during removal of the device 10 from the body in the manner discussed below. The through hole 22 may be substantially cylindrical, and optionally has flanged openings at one or both ends to better accommodate the suture and Both the diameter and length of the introducing device 10, as well as the diameter and depth or length of the cavity 16, can vary depending on the size of the surgical instrument being introduced into the body. For example, several different sized introduction devices 10 can be produced, each designed for use with one or more commercial staplers or commercial stapler anvils. During surgery, the introduction device compatible with the stapler or anvil being used would then be selected and used in order to introduce the stapler or anvil into the patient. In addition, for abdominal surgical applications, longer devices 10 can be produced to accommodate various sizes (thicknesses) of the abdominal wall, e.g., a longer device would be used for obese patients than for thin patients. Another variation in the construction of the device 10 would be to change the tapering radius of the body 10 and\/or front end 12 from that in the illustrated embodiment. The device 10 may be formed as a unitary member or body and may be made from surgical grade stainless steel, if a reusable device is desired, or from high-density polyethylene or plastic, if a single-use disposable device is desired. A device having the same dimensions can be formed from both stainless steel or polyethylene or plastic to provide the surgeon with options for use of the device. For a reusable device, the device would be sterilized prior to each use by conventional methods used in the preparation of surgical instruments. For a disposable device, the device would be supplied in a sterile package and discarded after use. FIGS. 5 and 6 show the use of the device 10 in combination with a circular surgical stapler 26. As shown in FIG. 5, the stapler 26 has a blunt open forward end 28 which makes it difficult to surgically introduce the stapler through a small opening in the body wall and can also cause fragments of the tissues around the opening in the body wall to become lodged into the 10 opening in the forward end 28 of the stapler 26. The tissue fragments could cause the stapling mechanism in the stapler 26 to malfunction. As shown in FIG. 6, in preparation for use, at least the forward end 28 of the stapler 26 is inserted into the cavity 16 in the device 10 to thereby attach the stapler 26 to the device 10. Suture thread 24 is then inserted through the through hole 22 until it extends on both sides of the 15 through hole. One end or both ends of the thread 24 would also be fixed or tied external to the patient or the ends of the thread 24 are tied together. The device 10 with attached stapler 26 is then inserted with its front end 12 forward through the opening in the body wall, e.g., a laparoscopic opening in the abdominal wall, while maintaining a portion of the thread 24 outside of the body. Insertion of the device 10 is facilitated by the rounded shape of the front end 12 of 20 the device 10 and the smooth arcuate surfaces 14 which are effective to spread the tissues around the opening outward and enable smooth passage of the device 10 and stapler 26 there through. Once in the abdominal cavity, the device 10 is removed from engagement with the stapler 26 by pulling on the suture thread 24. After removal of the device 10, the stapler 26 is situated in the abdominal cavity and ready for use. The forward end 28 of the stapler 26 has thus been prevented from receiving tissue fragments during its insertion into the abdominal cavity. After disengagement from the stapler 26 and removal of the stapler 26 after use, the 5 device 10 is removed from the abdominal cavity preferably with its front end 12 forward, for example, through the same opening through which the device 10 and stapler 26 were inserted into the abdominal cavity. Removal of the device 10 is facilitated by the rounded shape of the front end 12 of the device 10 which spreads the tissues around the opening outward and enable smooth passage of the device 10 there through. The stapler 26 is also removed from the abdominal cavity after use in a conventional manner, i.e., through the same opening through which it was inserted into the patient. FIGS. 7 and 8 show the use of the device 10 in combination with a stapler anvil 30. The anvil 30 has a blunt forward end 32 (see FIG. 7) which makes it difficult to surgically introduce the anvil through a small opening in the body wall. As shown in FIG. 8, in preparation for use, at least the forward end 32 of the anvil 30 is inserted into the cavity 16 in the device 10. Suture thread 24 is then inserted through the through hole 22 and one end or both ends of the thread 24 are fixed or tied external to the patient or the ends of the thread 24 are tied together. The device 10 with the anvil 30 at least partially received therein, is then inserted through the opening in the body wall with its front end 12 forward, e.g., a laparoscopic opening in the abdominal wall, while maintaining a portion of the thread 24 outside of the body. Once in the abdominal cavity, the device 10 is removed from engagement with the anvil 30 by pulling on the suture thread 24. After removal of the device 10, the anvil 30 is situated in the abdominal cavity and ready for use. After disengagement from the anvil 30, the device 10 is removed from the abdominal cavity with its front end 12 forward, for example, through the same opening through which the device 10 and anvil 30 were inserted into the abdominal cavity. The anvil 30 is also removed from the abdominal cavity after use in a conventional manner, i.e., through the same opening 5 through which it was inserted into the patient. Advantages of the use of the device 10 to insert surgical instruments into the body, such as a surgical stapler and stapler anvil, include a reduction in the time and effort required to introduce the surgical stapler or stapler anvil into the body, a reduction in the trauma caused to the tissue around the opening through which the surgical stapler or stapler anvil is inserted into the body, an improvement in the ergonomic position of the surgeon during the introduction of the surgical stapler or stapler anvil and the prevention of the entrapment of tissues of the body wall surrounding the opening with the stapler mechanism. In addition, the size of the opening in the body wall can be made quite small since the spreading action of the device 10 effectively, but only temporarily, expands the opening to allow the surgical stapler or stapler anvil to pass therethrough. While the invention has been described above with respect to specific apparatus and specific implementations, it should be clear that various modifications and alterations can be made, and various features of one embodiment can be included in other embodiments, within the scope of the present invention. For example, although the invention is described above for use in connection with surgery on humans, it can be used for animals. It can also be used to facilitate the insertion of surgical instruments into any part of the body and is not limited to insertion of surgical staplers and stapler anvils into the abdominal cavity. Moreover, although sometimes described for use in connection with laparoscopic openings, the invention can be used to insert surgical instruments through other types of openings in the body or body wall.","cpc_label":"A61B171155","ipc_label":"A61B17115","filing_date":"20160101","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20170706","examiner_id":"99411.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention relates generally to devices and methods for enabling the percutaneous (through layers of skin) or trans abdominal (through all or some layers of the abdominal wall) introduction of surgical instruments into the human body to perform specific surgical interventions on the organs located internally and more particularly to devices and methods for introducing blunt surgical instruments, such as a surgical circular stapler or stapler anvil (part of the stapler used to perform coupling of the tissues), through the body wall, for example, during intra-corporeal creation of a surgical anastomoses in laparoscopic or endoscopic surgical procedures, BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In a variety of surgical procedures, it is necessary to use a surgical stapler to staple separated internal parts of the body together., in the context of the novelty:  Device for facilitating insertion of a surgical instrument into a human body through an opening in a body wall .

The ergonomic can opener and lid remover 100 comprises an oblong body 10, wherein at least one of the corners of the oblong body defines a rounded section 10a, the oblong body 10 has a width, a length and a height, the oblong body 10 also defines a top 10b and a bottom side 10c, the oblong body 10 further defines: a reversed L shaped opening 12 that is defined at a section of the rounded section of the oblong body, the reversed L shaped opening 12 is at an angle that is from about 15 to 35 degrees from the side of the oblong body 10 defining the length of the body 10; at least one T shaped opening 14 that is defined on the same side of the oblong body 10 that defines the length of the body 10 and that is defined on the bottom side 10c of the body 10; and an oblong aperture 16 that runs adjacent to the side of the oblong body 10 that defines the top 10b of the body 10. In an embodiment of the present invention, a first T shaped 14 opening is defined in a middle section 10d of the bottom side of the body 10c. The T shaped opening 14 is positioned so that it can be used to apply a balanced force upwards when removing a lid. In another embodiment the width of the body is at least half an inch. The reason for the width is that it allows the fingers of a user to rest comfortably within the aperture when manipulating the opener 100 and minimizes the chances of the opener 100 cutting the fingers of the user. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the length of the body is at least 5 inches. The length allows an aperture to be defined within the body 10 of the opener 100. In still another embodiment of the present invention, the height of the body 10 is at least 2 inches. The reason for the height, is to provide the maximum ergonomic value when using the opener 100. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the oblong aperture 16 is at least 0.5 of an inch in height and at least 3 inches in length. In still a further embodiment of the present invention, 7 the reversed L shaped opening 12 is composed of a perpendicular branch 12a that flows from a vertical stem 12b, the branch 12a measure at least 0.3 of an inch and the stem 12b 0.6 of an inch. In a last embodiment of the present invention, a second T shaped opening 15 is defined adjacent to the first T shaped opening 14 along the bottom side 10c of the body 10 so that it is not adjacent to the rounded section 10a defining the reversed L shaped opening 12. To use the present invention, first a user first slides his fingers through the aperture of the oblong body so that the rounded section of the oblong body that defines the reversed L shaped opening is adjacent to the thumb of the user. Then the present invention is used by sliding the reversed L shaped opening underneath the ring of the stay tab until the tab is pushed upward, thereby opening the can. Then lastly, sliding the ring of the tab in either the branch of the reversed L shaped opening or in the arms of the T shaped opening and pulling upward. In this last step, when the user uses the branch, the user can use the rounded sections of the oblong body as a fulcrum for pulling the lid upward. By sliding the fingers through the aperture of the oblong body, the user minimizes the force required by the fingers to manipulate the tool. This is a key aspect of the resent invention. Another key aspect of the present invention is that it is a tool that does not have any sharp element that can be used as a weapon, thereby allowing a user suffering from arthritis to take the tool in environments that restrict tools that may be characterized as weapons. An advantage of the present invention is that it provides an ergonomic can opener and lid remover that is used to open cans that define a stay tab. Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides an ergonomic can opener and lid remover that is used by people whom suffer from arthritis. Yet another advantage of the present invention is that it provides an ergonomic and monolithic can opener and lid remover that serves to open and to remove lids of cans. Still a further advantage of the present invention is that it provides a tool that can be taken on airplanes as a carryon piece. Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail in reference to preferred versions, other versions are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the present invention should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein.","cpc_label":"B67B7406","ipc_label":"B67B740","filing_date":"20160101","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20170706","examiner_id":"74296.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention is directed to a device that will facilitate the opening of a can having a stay tab or pull tab., in the context of the novelty:  An ergonomic can opener and lid remover is used on cans defining a stay tab or pull tab .

For example, eyeball motion may be monitored in iris and\/or corneal recognition systems, stimulus response measurement, medical procedures, virtual reality systems, or other environments. Eyeball motion information may enable improved imaging of the eyeball, iris or retinal. Eyeball motion information may also enable imaging of the eyeball, iris, or cornea at greater ranges than would otherwise be possible. However, conventional eyeball motion tracking systems, such as stereo systems, may not provide position information related to an eyeball with enough speed and\/or accuracy for all of the possible applications of eyeball motion tracking. In general, these systems may also be hampered by an inability to determine position information related to an eyeball from a relatively extended distance. These and other drawbacks associated with conventional eyeball motion tracking systems and methods exist.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>One aspect of the invention relates to detecting position information related to a face, and more particularly to an eyeball in a face, using a detection and ranging system, such as a Radio Detection And Ranging (\u201cRADAR\u201d) system, or a Light Detection And Ranging (\u201cLIDAR\u201d) system. The position information may include a location of the eyeball, translational motion information related to the eyeball (e.g., displacement, velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc.), rotational motion information related to the eyeball (e.g., rotational displacement, rotational velocity, rotational acceleration, etc.) as the eyeball rotates within its socket. One of the advantages of the implementation of a detection and ranging system in detecting position information related to the eyeball may include an increased speed at which the position information may be determined. In fact, in some implementations, the determination of the position information may be substantially instantaneous with substantially no latency. Another advantage of the implementation of a detection and ranging system in detecting position information related to the eyeball may include enabling eyeball motion to be determined from an increased distance and\/or with a reduced invasiveness to the individual. As mentioned above, the detection and ranging system may include a coherent LIDAR system. In these implementations, a first set of electromagnetic radiation beams may be incident on the eyeball at one or more locations on the eyeball. The first set of electromagnetic radiation beams may be returned from these locations on the eyeball to the LIDAR system (e.g., via backscattering, reflection, etc.), and the frequency shift of the returned electromagnetic radiation may be measured. The coherent LIDAR system may determine information related to one or both of location (e.g., x, y, z) and rotational velocity (e.g., a component of the velocity of the surface of the eyeball that is parallel to an incident electromagnetic radiation beam) at each measurement location on the eyeball. If the radius of the eyeball is known, this information may be determined with three measurement beams focused on three separate measurement locations on the eyeball. If the radius is unknown, the radius may be determined with a fourth measurement beam focused on a fourth separate measurement location on the eyeball. Once the eye has been located (e.g., with three measurement beams if the radius is known or with four measurement beams if the radius is not known), the center of the eye and the closest point of the eye may be determined based on the known location. At individual ones of the measurement locations, a velocity vector representative of the movement of the eyeball within the eye socket that is tangential to the surface of the eyeball may be determined. If a valid determination of this velocity vector is made for at least two measurement locations on the eyeball that are (i) not the closest point and are (ii) not on the same great circle with each other and the closest point, then the rotational motion of the eyeball within its socket may be determined by the LIDAR system. This may enable the tracking of the lateral rotational motion of the eyeball, and by extension the surface features on the eyeball (e.g., the iris, the pupil, etc.). It should be appreciated that the eyeball may not be formed as a perfect sphere, and that asymmetries in the shape of the eyeball may impact the velocity vector that is calculated at a given measurement location on the eyeball. However, eyeball shape in general is close enough to spherical that typically any non-uniformities in the eyeball may be de minimis and, as such, the eyeball may assumed to be perfectly spherical in some embodiments (and for illustrative purposes herein). In some implementations, lateral or vertical motion of the face that displaces the eye socket, along with the eyeball, may be determined by video optical flow processing of video footage captured by a video imaging system being used in conjunction with the LIDAR system. Rotation in the plane of the image of the video imaging system may also be determined in this manner. Movement (e.g., displacement, rotation, etc.) of the face out of the plane of the images captured by the video imaging system may be determined by the LIDAR system. For example, a second set of electromagnetic beams may be emitted from the LIDAR system to one or more locations on the face (other than the eyeball), and range and range rate measurements of the one or more locations on the face may be made to determine information related to the movement of the face out of the plane of the images captured by the video imaging system. The relatively low frequency of head motion and the great number of measurements will allow for a relatively high accuracy of head motion determination in this, or some other, manner. This being done, the location and velocity of the 3D center points of the eyeballs may be determined so that the residual motion of the eyeballs in the eye sockets may be determined separate from the motion of the eye sockets, as if the eyeball were in a stationary socket. Another aspect of various embodiments of the invention may relate to a laser radar system that unambiguously detects a range of a target and a range rate at which the target is moving relative to the laser radar system. Another aspect of various embodiments of the invention may relate to a laser radar system that uses multiple laser radar sections to obtain multiple simultaneous measurements (or substantially so), whereby both range and range rate can be determined without various temporal effects introduced by systems employing single laser sections taking sequential measurements. In addition, other aspects of various embodiments of the invention may enable faster determination of the range and rate of the target, a more accurate determination of the range and rate of the target, and\/or may provide other advantages. In some embodiments of the invention, the laser radar system may emit a first target beam and a second target beam toward a target. The first target beam and the second target beam may be reflected by the target back toward the laser radar system. The laser radar system may receive the reflected first target beam and second target beam, and may determine at least one of a range of the target from the laser radar system, and a range rate of the target. In some embodiments of the invention, the laser radar system may include a first laser radar section, a second laser radar section, and a processor. In some embodiments of the invention, the first laser radar section may generate a first target beam and a first reference beam. The first target beam and the first reference beam may be generated by a first laser source at a first frequency that may be modulated at a first chirp rate. The first target beam may be directed toward a measurement point on the target. The first laser radar section may combine one portion of the first target beam that may be directed towards, and reflected from, the target. Another portion of the first target beam, referred to as a local oscillator beam, may be directed over a path with a known or otherwise fixed path length. This may result in a combined first target beam. According to various embodiments of the invention, the second laser radar section may be collocated and fixed with respect to the first laser radar section. More particularly, the relevant optical components for transmitting and receiving the respective laser beams are collocated and fixed. The second laser radar section may generate a second target beam and a second reference beam. The second target beam and the second reference beam may be generated by a second laser source at a second frequency that may be modulated at a second chirp rate. The second chirp rate may be different from the first chirp rate. This may facilitate one or more aspects of downstream processing, such as, signal discrimination, or other aspects of downstream processing. The second target beam may be directed toward the same measurement point on the target as the first target beam. The second laser radar section may combine one portion of the second target beam that may be directed towards, and reflected from, the target, and another portion of the second target beam that may be directed over a path with a known or otherwise fixed path length. This results in a combined second target beam. According to various embodiments of the invention, the processor receives the first and second combined target beams and measures a beat frequency caused by a difference in path length between each of the respective reflected target beams and its corresponding local oscillator beam, and by any Doppler frequency shift created by target motion relative to the laser radar system. The beat frequencies may then be combined linearly to generate unambiguous determinations of the range and the range rate of the target, so long as the beat frequencies between each of the respective local oscillator beams and the its reflected target beam correspond to simultaneous (or substantially simultaneous) temporal components of the reflected target beams. Simultaneous (or substantially simultaneous) temporal components of the reflected target beams may include temporal components of the target beams that: 1) have been incident on substantially the same portion of the target, 2) have been impacted by similar transmission effects, 3) have been directed by a scanning optical element under substantially the same conditions, and\/or 4) share other similarities. The utilization of beat frequencies that correspond to simultaneous (or substantially simultaneous) temporal components of the reflected target beams for linear combination may effectively cancel any noise introduced into the data by environmental or other effects. Because the combined target beams may be created by separately combining the first local oscillator beam and the second local oscillator beam with different target beams, or different portions of the same target beam, the first combined target beam and the second combined target beam may represent optical signals that might be present in two separate, but coincident, single source frequency modulated laser radar systems, just prior to final processing. For example, the combined target beams may represent optical signals produced by target interferometers in the single source systems. According to various embodiments, the target beams may be directed to and\/or received from the target on separate optical paths. In some embodiments, these optical paths may be similar but distinct. In other embodiments the first target beam and the second target beam may be coupled prior to emission to create a combined target beam that may be directed toward the target along a common optical path. In some embodiments, the target beam may be reflected by the target and may be received by the laser radar system along a reception optical path separate from the common optical path that directed the target beam toward the target. Such embodiments may be labeled \u201cbistatic.\u201d Or, the combined target beam may be received by the laser radar system along the common optical path. These latter embodiments may be labeled \u201cmonostatic.\u201d Monostatic embodiments may provide advantages over their bistatic counterparts when operating with reciprocal optics. More particularly, monostatic embodiments of the invention are less affected by differential Doppler effects and distortion due to speckle, among other things. Differential Doppler effects are created, for example, by a scanning mirror that directs the target beam to different locations on a target. Since different parts of the mirror are moving at different velocities, different parts of the target beam experience different Doppler shifts, which may introduce errors into the range and or range rate measurements. These effects have been investigated and analyzed by Anthony Slotwinski and others, for example, in NASA Langley Contract No. NAS1-18890 (May 1991) Phase II Final Report, Appendix K, submitted by Digital Signal Corporation, 8003 Forbes Place, Springfield, Va. 22131, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some instances, the first laser source and the second laser source may generate electromagnetic radiation at a first carrier frequency and a second carrier frequency, respectively. The first carrier frequency may be substantially the same as the second carrier frequency. This may provide various enhancements to the laser radar system, such as, for example, minimizing distortion due to speckle, or other enhancements. In some embodiments, the first laser source and the second laser source may provide electromagnetic radiation with highly linearized frequency chirp. To this end, the linearization of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the first laser source and the second laser source may be calibrated on a frequent basis (e.g. each chirp), or in some embodiments continuously (or substantially so). This linearization the frequency chirp of the electromagnetic radiation may provide enhanced range measurement accuracy, or other enhancements, over conventional systems in which linearization may occur at startup, when an operator notices degraded system performance, when the operator is prompted to initiate linearization based on a potential for degraded performance, or when one or more system parameters fall out of tolerance, etc. Frequent and\/or automated linearization may reduce mirror differential Doppler noise effects during high speed scanning and may maximize the effectiveness of dual chirp techniques for canceling out these and other noise contributions to range estimates. In some embodiments of the invention, the laser radar system may determine the range and the range rate of the target with an increased accuracy when the range of the target from the laser radar system falls within a set of ranges between a minimum range and a maximum range. When the range of the target does not fall within the set of ranges, the accuracy of the laser radar system may be degraded. This degradation may be a result of the coherence length(s) of the first laser source and the second laser source, which is finite in nature. For example, the distance between the minimum range and the maximum range may be a function of the coherence length. The longer the coherence length of the first laser source and the second laser source, the greater the distance between the minimum range and the maximum range. Thus, increasing the coherence length of the first laser source and the second laser source may enhance range and range rate determinations by the laser radar system by providing the ability to make determinations over an enhanced set of ranges. In some embodiments of the invention, one or both of the first laser source and the second laser source may implement a system and method for controllably chirping electromagnetic radiation from a radiation source. The system and method may enable electromagnetic radiation to be produced at a substantially linear chirp rate with a configurable period. In some embodiments, the radiation may include a single, frequency shifted, resonant mode. In some embodiments of the invention, a system may include a radiation source, one or more optical elements that form an optical cavity, a frequency shifter, an optical switch and an optical amplifier. In some embodiments, the frequency shifter may be disposed within the optical cavity to receive electromagnetic radiation from the optical cavity, and to output a frequency shifted portion of the received electromagnetic radiation back to the optical cavity. The optical switch may be disposed within the optical cavity to receive electromagnetic radiation from the optical cavity. The optical switch may be controllable to either direct the received electromagnetic radiation away from the optical cavity, or to return the received electromagnetic radiation back to the optical cavity. In some instances, the optical switch may be controllable to couple radiation from the radiation source to the optical cavity while directing the received electromagnetic radiation away from the optical cavity, the radiation from the source being received at the optical switch at an initial frequency. According to various embodiments of the invention, the optical cavity may be \u201cfilled\u201d by directing radiation from the laser source, emitted at the initial frequency, into the optical cavity for a period of time that corresponds to the optical length of the optical cavity. In some embodiments, the radiation from the laser source may be directed into the optical cavity by the optical switch. While the electromagnetic radiation from the laser source is being directed in to the cavity, the optical switch may be controlled to direct radiation received by the optical switch away from the optical cavity, or \u201cdumped\u201d from the cavity. Once the cavity is \u201cfilled\u201d (e.g., after the time period corresponding to the optical length of the optical cavity has passed) the flow of radiation from the laser source to the optical cavity may be halted. In some embodiment, the flow of radiation from the laser source to the optical cavity may be halted by powering down the laser source. In other embodiments, the flow of radiation from the laser source to the optical cavity may be halted by controlling the optical switch to dump the radiation from the laser source away from the optical cavity. The radiation injected into the optical cavity while the cavity was being filled, may be circulated within the cavity by the optical switch, which may be controlled to direct radiation received from the optical cavity back into the optical cavity. In some embodiments of the invention, as the electromagnetic radiation is circulated within the optical cavity, the frequency of the radiation may be incrementally adjusted by the frequency shifter during each trip around the optical cavity. Through this periodic, incremental adjustment, the frequency of the radiation within the optical cavity may be chirped in a substantially linear manner. The rate at which the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation is chirped may be related to one or both of the incremental frequency adjustment applied by the frequency shifter and the optical length of the cavity. Thus, the rate at which the frequency of the radiation is chirped, may be controlled via one or both of these variables. In some embodiments, a quality factor of the optical cavity may be degraded by various losses within the optical cavity. For example, radiation output from the optical cavity to a device may constitute a loss. Other losses may also be present, such as losses due to imperfections in the optical elements, or other parasitic losses. To combat the degradation of the quality factor, an optical amplifier may be disposed within the optical cavity. The optical amplifier may be selected or controlled to provide enough gain to radiation within the optical cavity to overcome the sum of the cavity losses so that a predetermined or controlled intensity of radiation output from the optical cavity may be maintained. The optical amplifier may also be selected based on one or more other characteristics, such as, for example, homogeneous line width, gain bandwidth, or other specifications. In some embodiments of the invention, one of the chirp rates may be set equal to zero. In other words, one of the laser sources may emit radiation at a constant frequency. This may enable the laser source emitting at a constant frequency to be implemented with a simpler design, a small footprint, a lighter weight, a decreased cost, or other enhancements that may provide advantages to the overall system. In these embodiments, the laser radar section with chirp rate set equal to zero may be used to determine only the range rate of the target. In some embodiments of the invention, the processor may linearly combine the first combined target beam and the second combined target beam digitally to generate the range signal and the range rate signal. For example, the processor may include a first detector and a second detector. The first detector may receive the first combined target beam and may generate a first analog signal that corresponds to the first combined target beam. The first analog signal may be converted to a first digital signal by a first converter. The processor may include a first frequency data module that may determine a first set of frequency data that corresponds to one or more frequency components of the first digital signal. The second detector may receive the second combined target beam and may generate a second analog signal that corresponds to the second combined target beam. The second analog signal may be converted to a second digital signal by a second converter. The processor may include a second frequency data module that may determine a second set of frequency data that corresponds to one or more of frequency components of the second digital signal. The first set of frequency data and the second set of frequency data may be received by a frequency data combination module. The frequency data combination module may generate a range rate signal and a range signal derived from the first set of frequency data and the second set of frequency data. In other embodiments of the invention, the processor may mix the first combined target beam and the second combined target beam electronically to generate the range signal and the range rate signal. For example, the processor may include a modulator. The modulator may multiply the first analog signal generated by the first detector and the second analog signal generated by the second detector to create a combined analog signal. In such embodiments, the processor may include a first filter and a second filter that receive the combined analog signal. The first filter may filter the combined analog signal to generate a first filtered signal. The first filtered signal may be converted by a first converter to generate a range rate signal. The second filter may filter the combined analog signal to generate a second filtered signal. The second filtered signal may be converted by a second converter to generate a range signal. According to other embodiments of the invention, the processor may mix the first combined target beam and the second combined target beam optically to generate the range signal and the range rate signal. For example, the processor may include a detector that receives the first combined target beam and the second combined target beam and generates a combined analog signal based on the detection of the first combined target beam and the second combined target beam. In such embodiments, the processor may include a first filter and a second filter that receive the combined analog signal. The first filter may filter the combined analog signal to generate a first filtered signal. The first filtered signal may be converted by a first converter to generate a range rate signal. The second filter may filter the combined analog signal to generate a second filtered signal. The second filtered signal may be converted by a second converter to generate a range signal.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to tracking the movement of an eyeball, and more particularly to tracking the movement of an eyeball using a detection and ranging system. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Determining the motion of an eyeball of an individual may have practical application in a multitude of environments. For example, eyeball motion may be monitored in iris and\/or corneal recognition systems, stimulus response measurement, medical procedures, virtual reality systems, or other environments. Eyeball motion information may enable improved imaging of the eyeball, iris or retinal. Eyeball motion information may also enable imaging of the eyeball, iris, or cornea at greater ranges than would otherwise be possible. However, conventional eyeball motion tracking systems, such as stereo systems, may not provide position information related to an eyeball with enough speed and\/or accuracy for all of the possible applications of eyeball motion tracking. In general, these systems may also be hampered by an inability to determine position information related to an eyeball from a relatively extended distance. These and other drawbacks associated with conventional eyeball motion tracking systems and methods exist. SUMMARY One aspect of the invention relates to detecting position information related to a face, and more particularly to an eyeball in a face, using a detection and ranging system, such as a Radio Detection And Ranging (\u201cRADAR\u201d) system, or a Light Detection And Ranging (\u201cLIDAR\u201d) system. The position information may include a location of the eyeball, translational motion information related to the eyeball (e.g., displacement, velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc.), rotational motion information related to the eyeball (e.g., rotational displacement, rotational velocity, rotational acceleration, etc.) as the eyeball rotates within its socket. One of the advantages of the implementation of a detection and ranging system in detecting position information related to the eyeball may include an increased speed at which the position information may be determined. In fact, in some implementations, the determination of the position information may be substantially instantaneous with substantially no latency. Another advantage of the implementation of a detection and ranging system in detecting position information related to the eyeball may include enabling eyeball motion to be determined from an increased distance and\/or with a reduced invasiveness to the individual. As mentioned above, the detection and ranging system may include a coherent LIDAR system. In these implementations, a first set of electromagnetic radiation beams may be incident on the eyeball at one or more locations on the eyeball. The first set of electromagnetic radiation beams may be returned from these locations on the eyeball to the LIDAR system (e.g., via backscattering, reflection, etc.), and the frequency shift of the returned electromagnetic radiation may be measured. The coherent LIDAR system may determine information related to one or both of location (e.g., x, y, z) and rotational velocity (e.g., a component of the velocity of the surface of the eyeball that is parallel to an incident electromagnetic radiation beam) at each measurement location on the eyeball. If the radius of the eyeball is known, this information may be determined with three measurement beams focused on three separate measurement locations on the eyeball. If the radius is unknown, the radius may be determined with a fourth measurement beam focused on a fourth separate measurement location on the eyeball. Once the eye has been located (e.g., with three measurement beams if the radius is known or with four measurement beams if the radius is not known), the center of the eye and the closest point of the eye may be determined based on the known location. At individual ones of the measurement locations, a velocity vector representative of the movement of the eyeball within the eye socket that is tangential to the surface of the eyeball may be determined. If a valid determination of this velocity vector is made for at least two measurement locations on the eyeball that are (i) not the closest point and are (ii) not on the same great circle with each other and the closest point, then the rotational motion of the eyeball within its socket may be determined by the LIDAR system. This may enable the tracking of the lateral rotational motion of the eyeball, and by extension the surface features on the eyeball (e.g., the iris, the pupil, etc.). It should be appreciated that the eyeball may not be formed as a perfect sphere, and that asymmetries in the shape of the eyeball may impact the velocity vector that is calculated at a given measurement location on the eyeball. However, eyeball shape in general is close enough to spherical that typically any non-uniformities in the eyeball may be de minimis and, as such, the eyeball may assumed to be perfectly spherical in some embodiments (and for illustrative purposes herein). In some implementations, lateral or vertical motion of the face that displaces the eye socket, along with the eyeball, may be determined by video optical flow processing of video footage captured by a video imaging system being used in conjunction with the LIDAR system. Rotation in the plane of the image of the video imaging system may also be determined in this manner. Movement (e.g., displacement, rotation, etc.) of the face out of the plane of the images captured by the video imaging system may be determined by the LIDAR system. For example, a second set of electromagnetic beams may be emitted from the LIDAR system to one or more locations on the face (other than the eyeball), and range and range rate measurements of the one or more locations on the face may be made to determine information related to the movement of the face out of the plane of the images captured by the video imaging system. The relatively low frequency of head motion and the great number of measurements will allow for a relatively high accuracy of head motion determination in this, or some other, manner. This being done, the location and velocity of the 3D center points of the eyeballs may be determined so that the residual motion of the eyeballs in the eye sockets may be determined separate from the motion of the eye sockets, as if the eyeball were in a stationary socket. Another aspect of various embodiments of the invention may relate to a laser radar system that unambiguously detects a range of a target and a range rate at which the target is moving relative to the laser radar system. Another aspect of various embodiments of the invention may relate to a laser radar system that uses multiple laser radar sections to obtain multiple simultaneous measurements (or substantially so), whereby both range and range rate can be determined without various temporal effects introduced by systems employing single laser sections taking sequential measurements. In addition, other aspects of various embodiments of the invention may enable faster determination of the range and rate of the target, a more accurate determination of the range and rate of the target, and\/or may provide other advantages. In some embodiments of the invention, the laser radar system may emit a first target beam and a second target beam toward a target. The first target beam and the second target beam may be reflected by the target back toward the laser radar system. The laser radar system may receive the reflected first target beam and second target beam, and may determine at least one of a range of the target from the laser radar system, and a range rate of the target. In some embodiments of the invention, the laser radar system may include a first laser radar section, a second laser radar section, and a processor. In some embodiments of the invention, the first laser radar section may generate a first target beam and a first reference beam. The first target beam and the first reference beam may be generated by a first laser source at a first frequency that may be modulated at a first chirp rate. The first target beam may be directed toward a measurement point on the target. The first laser radar section may combine one portion of the first target beam that may be directed towards, and reflected from, the target. Another portion of the first target beam, referred to as a local oscillator beam, may be directed over a path with a known or otherwise fixed path length. This may result in a combined first target beam. According to various embodiments of the invention, the second laser radar section may be collocated and fixed with respect to the first laser radar section. More particularly, the relevant optical components for transmitting and receiving the respective laser beams are collocated and fixed. The second laser radar section may generate a second target beam and a second reference beam. The second target beam and the second reference beam may be generated by a second laser source at a second frequency that may be modulated at a second chirp rate. The second chirp rate may be different from the first chirp rate. This may facilitate one or more aspects of downstream processing, such as, signal discrimination, or other aspects of downstream processing. The second target beam may be directed toward the same measurement point on the target as the first target beam. The second laser radar section may combine one portion of the second target beam that may be directed towards, and reflected from, the target, and another portion of the second target beam that may be directed over a path with a known or otherwise fixed path length. This results in a combined second target beam. According to various embodiments of the invention, the processor receives the first and second combined target beams and measures a beat frequency caused by a difference in path length between each of the respective reflected target beams and its corresponding local oscillator beam, and by any Doppler frequency shift created by target motion relative to the laser radar system. The beat frequencies may then be combined linearly to generate unambiguous determinations of the range and the range rate of the target, so long as the beat frequencies between each of the respective local oscillator beams and the its reflected target beam correspond to simultaneous (or substantially simultaneous) temporal components of the reflected target beams. Simultaneous (or substantially simultaneous) temporal components of the reflected target beams may include temporal components of the target beams that: 1) have been incident on substantially the same portion of the target, 2) have been impacted by similar transmission effects, 3) have been directed by a scanning optical element under substantially the same conditions, and\/or 4) share other similarities. The utilization of beat frequencies that correspond to simultaneous (or substantially simultaneous) temporal components of the reflected target beams for linear combination may effectively cancel any noise introduced into the data by environmental or other effects. Because the combined target beams may be created by separately combining the first local oscillator beam and the second local oscillator beam with different target beams, or different portions of the same target beam, the first combined target beam and the second combined target beam may represent optical signals that might be present in two separate, but coincident, single source frequency modulated laser radar systems, just prior to final processing. For example, the combined target beams may represent optical signals produced by target interferometers in the single source systems. According to various embodiments, the target beams may be directed to and\/or received from the target on separate optical paths. In some embodiments, these optical paths may be similar but distinct. In other embodiments the first target beam and the second target beam may be coupled prior to emission to create a combined target beam that may be directed toward the target along a common optical path. In some embodiments, the target beam may be reflected by the target and may be received by the laser radar system along a reception optical path separate from the common optical path that directed the target beam toward the target. Such embodiments may be labeled \u201cbistatic.\u201d Or, the combined target beam may be received by the laser radar system along the common optical path. These latter embodiments may be labeled \u201cmonostatic.\u201d Monostatic embodiments may provide advantages over their bistatic counterparts when operating with reciprocal optics. More particularly, monostatic embodiments of the invention are less affected by differential Doppler effects and distortion due to speckle, among other things. Differential Doppler effects are created, for example, by a scanning mirror that directs the target beam to different locations on a target. Since different parts of the mirror are moving at different velocities, different parts of the target beam experience different Doppler shifts, which may introduce errors into the range and or range rate measurements. These effects have been investigated and analyzed by Anthony Slotwinski and others, for example, in NASA Langley Contract No. NAS1-18890 (May 1991) Phase II Final Report, Appendix K, submitted by Digital Signal Corporation, 8003 Forbes Place, Springfield, Va. 22131, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some instances, the first laser source and the second laser source may generate electromagnetic radiation at a first carrier frequency and a second carrier frequency, respectively. The first carrier frequency may be substantially the same as the second carrier frequency. This may provide various enhancements to the laser radar system, such as, for example, minimizing distortion due to speckle, or other enhancements. In some embodiments, the first laser source and the second laser source may provide electromagnetic radiation with highly linearized frequency chirp. To this end, the linearization of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the first laser source and the second laser source may be calibrated on a frequent basis (e.g. each chirp), or in some embodiments continuously (or substantially so). This linearization the frequency chirp of the electromagnetic radiation may provide enhanced range measurement accuracy, or other enhancements, over conventional systems in which linearization may occur at startup, when an operator notices degraded system performance, when the operator is prompted to initiate linearization based on a potential for degraded performance, or when one or more system parameters fall out of tolerance, etc. Frequent and\/or automated linearization may reduce mirror differential Doppler noise effects during high speed scanning and may maximize the effectiveness of dual chirp techniques for canceling out these and other noise contributions to range estimates. In some embodiments of the invention, the laser radar system may determine the range and the range rate of the target with an increased accuracy when the range of the target from the laser radar system falls within a set of ranges between a minimum range and a maximum range. When the range of the target does not fall within the set of ranges, the accuracy of the laser radar system may be degraded. This degradation may be a result of the coherence length(s) of the first laser source and the second laser source, which is finite in nature. For example, the distance between the minimum range and the maximum range may be a function of the coherence length. The longer the coherence length of the first laser source and the second laser source, the greater the distance between the minimum range and the maximum range. Thus, increasing the coherence length of the first laser source and the second laser source may enhance range and range rate determinations by the laser radar system by providing the ability to make determinations over an enhanced set of ranges. In some embodiments of the invention, one or both of the first laser source and the second laser source may implement a system and method for controllably chirping electromagnetic radiation from a radiation source. The system and method may enable electromagnetic radiation to be produced at a substantially linear chirp rate with a configurable period. In some embodiments, the radiation may include a single, frequency shifted, resonant mode. In some embodiments of the invention, a system may include a radiation source, one or more optical elements that form an optical cavity, a frequency shifter, an optical switch and an optical amplifier. In some embodiments, the frequency shifter may be disposed within the optical cavity to receive electromagnetic radiation from the optical cavity, and to output a frequency shifted portion of the received electromagnetic radiation back to the optical cavity. The optical switch may be disposed within the optical cavity to receive electromagnetic radiation from the optical cavity. The optical switch may be controllable to either direct the received electromagnetic radiation away from the optical cavity, or to return the received electromagnetic radiation back to the optical cavity. In some instances, the optical switch may be controllable to couple radiation from the radiation source to the optical cavity while directing the received electromagnetic radiation away from the optical cavity, the radiation from the source being received at the optical switch at an initial frequency. According to various embodiments of the invention, the optical cavity may be \u201cfilled\u201d by directing radiation from the laser source, emitted at the initial frequency, into the optical cavity for a period of time that corresponds to the optical length of the optical cavity. In some embodiments, the radiation from the laser source may be directed into the optical cavity by the optical switch. While the electromagnetic radiation from the laser source is being directed in to the cavity, the optical switch may be controlled to direct radiation received by the optical switch away from the optical cavity, or \u201cdumped\u201d from the cavity. Once the cavity is \u201cfilled\u201d (e.g., after the time period corresponding to the optical length of the optical cavity has passed) the flow of radiation from the laser source to the optical cavity may be halted. In some embodiment, the flow of radiation from the laser source to the optical cavity may be halted by powering down the laser source. In other embodiments, the flow of radiation from the laser source to the optical cavity may be halted by controlling the optical switch to dump the radiation from the laser source away from the optical cavity. The radiation injected into the optical cavity while the cavity was being filled, may be circulated within the cavity by the optical switch, which may be controlled to direct radiation received from the optical cavity back into the optical cavity. In some embodiments of the invention, as the electromagnetic radiation is circulated within the optical cavity, the frequency of the radiation may be incrementally adjusted by the frequency shifter during each trip around the optical cavity. Through this periodic, incremental adjustment, the frequency of the radiation within the optical cavity may be chirped in a substantially linear manner. The rate at which the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation is chirped may be related to one or both of the incremental frequency adjustment applied by the frequency shifter and the optical length of the cavity. Thus, the rate at which the frequency of the radiation is chirped, may be controlled via one or both of these variables. In some embodiments, a quality factor of the optical cavity may be degraded by various losses within the optical cavity. For example, radiation output from the optical cavity to a device may constitute a loss. Other losses may also be present, such as losses due to imperfections in the optical elements, or other parasitic losses. To combat the degradation of the quality factor, an optical amplifier may be disposed within the optical cavity. The optical amplifier may be selected or controlled to provide enough gain to radiation within the optical cavity to overcome the sum of the cavity losses so that a predetermined or controlled intensity of radiation output from the optical cavity may be maintained. The optical amplifier may also be selected based on one or more other characteristics, such as, for example, homogeneous line width, gain bandwidth, or other specifications. In some embodiments of the invention, one of the chirp rates may be set equal to zero. In other words, one of the laser sources may emit radiation at a constant frequency. This may enable the laser source emitting at a constant frequency to be implemented with a simpler design, a small footprint, a lighter weight, a decreased cost, or other enhancements that may provide advantages to the overall system. In these embodiments, the laser radar section with chirp rate set equal to zero may be used to determine only the range rate of the target.

FIG. 2 illustrates a laser radar system that may be implemented in the system for monitoring an eyeball of an individual according to one or more embodiments of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is an exemplary illustration of a system 110 for detecting position information related to a face, and more particularly to an eyeball in a face of an individual 112, in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. System 110 may determine position information related to the eyeball of individual 112. System 110 may include a laser radar system 116 capable of determining a range to and\/or a range rate (i.e., velocity) of a point on a surface of individual 112 (e.g., skin, clothing, lips, etc.). System 110 may include a monitor module 118 capable of determining position information related to the eyeball of individual 112 based on the determinations of laser radar system 116. System 110 may enable the position information related to the eyeball of individual 112 to be monitored and determined remotely from individual 112 without directly contacting individual 112. In some embodiments of the invention, laser radar system 116 may direct a beam of electromagnetic radiation 114 toward individual 112 to be incident on individual 112 at a point on the surface of individual 112 to be measured. Some or all of radiation 114 directed to the point on the surface of individual 112 may be reflected by the surface, and may then be received back into laser radar system 116. As described below, based on one or more aspects of radiation 114 (e.g., frequency, phase, intensity, etc.) prior to emission and\/or subsequent to reflection, laser radar system 116 may determine one or both of the range and the range rate of the point on the surface with respect to laser radar system 116. According to various embodiments of the invention, laser radar system 116 may make a plurality of determinations of range and\/or range rate of a set of measurement points on a surface of the eyeball of individual 112 (e.g., at a periodic rate) over a period of time. Monitor module 118 may implement the determined ranges and range rates to determine the position information related to the eyeball. According to various embodiments of the invention, monitor module 118 may additionally monitor movement of the head of individual 112, in order to more accurately determine position information related to the eyeball of individual 112. In some of these embodiments, system 110 may include a video imaging system that captured video footage (successive images) of individual 112. Lateral or vertical motion of the face of individual 112 (in the plane of the images captured by the video imaging system) that displaces the eye socket, along with the eyeball, may be determined by video optical flow processing (or some other motion tracking processing) of the video footage captured by the video imaging system. Similarly, the rotation of the face of individual 112 within the image plane may be determined. In this way, three degrees of motion may be measured by the video imaging system. This optical flow processing may be performed by monitor module 118. Motion of the face of individual 112 out of the plane of the images captured by the video imaging system may be determined by taking measurements of the face (outside of the eye sockets) by laser radar system 116. These motions comprise range motion (a translational degree of freedom) and the two rotational degrees of freedom that are orthogonal to the image plane of the video imaging system. Thus, by combining the information determined from the video footage captured by the video imaging system and the measurements of laser radar system 116, monitor module 118 may determine the motion of the face of individual 112 in six degrees of freedom. By determining the motion of the face of individual 112, monitor module 118 may track the motion and\/or position of the eye socket of individual 112. Monitor module 118 may adjust determinations of the position and\/or movement of the eyeball of individual 112, using the motion and\/or position of the eye socket of individual 112, to reflect only (or substantially only) the rotation of the eyeball in the eye socket. FIG. 2 illustrates a frequency modulated laser radar system 210 that may be implemented within system 110 as laser radar system 116, according to some embodiments of the invention. System 210 may include a laser source 212 that emits a beam 214 of electromagnetic radiation. Beam 214 may be emitted at a frequency that is continuously varied, or chirped. In some instances, chirping the frequency may include sweeping the frequency between a lower frequency and an upper frequency (or vice versa) in a periodic manner (e.g. a sawtooth waveform, a triangle waveform, etc.). Beam 214 may be divided by an optical coupler 216 into a target beam 218 and a reference beam 220. It should be appreciated that although laser radar system 210 is shown and described as a single beam system, that in order to provide beams of electromagnetic radiation to a plurality of points on the eyeball of the individual beam 214 may be divided into a plurality of beams, and each beam may then be subsequently processed in the manner described below. In conventional embodiments, system 210 may include a target interferometer 222 and a reference interferometer 224. Target interferometer 222 may receive target beam 218, and may divide the target beam at an optical coupler 226. Target interferometer 222 is typically used to generate a target signal that may depend upon a range of a target 230 (e.g. individual 112) from target interferometer 222. Target interferometer may accomplish this by directing one portion 228 of target beam 218 toward target 230, and the other portion 232 of target beam 218 to a target frequency difference module 234 over an optical path with a fixed path length. Portion 228 of target beam 218 may be reflected by target 230 and may be transmitted to target frequency difference module 234 via optical coupler 226 and an optical fiber 236. Based on interference between portions 236 and 232 at coupler 248, target frequency difference module 234 may generate the target signal corresponding to a beat frequency of portions 236 and 232 of target beam 218 due to the difference between their path lengths. According to various embodiments of the invention, reference interferometer 224 may receive reference beam 220 and may generate a reference signal corresponding to a frequency difference between two portions of reference beam 224 that may be directed over two separate fixed paths with a known path length difference. More particularly, reference beam 220 may be divided by an optical coupler 240 into a first portion 242 and a second portion 244. First portion 242 may have a fixed optical path length difference relative to second portion 244. Based on interference between portions 242 and 244 at coupler 246, reference frequency difference module 250 may generate the reference signal corresponding to a beat frequency of portions 242 and 244 of reference beam 220 caused by the fixed difference between their path lengths. As will be appreciated, target interferometer 222 and reference interferometer 224 have been illustrated and described as Mach-Zehnder interferometers. However other interferometer configurations may be utilized. For example, target interferometer 222 and reference interferometer 224 may include embodiments wherein Michelson-Morley interferometers may be formed. In some embodiments, system 210 may include a processor 238. Processor 238 may receive the target signal and the reference signal and may process these signals to determine the range of target 230. Range information determined based on the target signal and the reference signal may be used to determine a range rate of target 230 with respect to target interferometer 222. FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a laser radar system 310 that may be implemented within system 110, as laser radar system 116, to monitor one or more points on a surface of the eyeball of individual 112, according to some embodiments of the invention. Laser radar system 310 may employ two or more laser radar sections, each of which emits a target beam of radiation toward a target. For example, a first laser radar section 374 emits a first target beam 312 and a second laser radar section 376 emits a second target beam 314 toward a target 316 (e.g., individual 112). In some embodiments of the invention, first target beam 312 and second target beam 314 may be chirped to create a dual chirp system. The implementation of laser radar system 310 in system 110 to monitor one or more points on a surface of the eyeball of individual 112 may provide unambiguous determinations of the range and the range rate of the points on the surface of the eyeball of individual 112 with respect to system 110, and may enable enhanced determinations of position information related to the eyeball of individual 112 by monitoring module 118. For example, the unambiguous determination of the range and\/or the range rate of the points on the surface of the eyeball of individual 112 may reduce an amount of noise in the determined ranges and\/or range rates. If present, the noise may impact the accuracy of the determinations of the ranges and\/or range rates. Inaccuracies within the determined ranges and\/or range rates may hamper determinations that leverage the determined ranges and\/or range rates to position information related to the eyeball of individual 112. It should be appreciated that although laser radar system 310 is shown and described as a dual beam system that provides two beams incident on a single point, that this description is not limiting and that in order to provide monitor a plurality of points on the eyeball each of the target beams may be divided into a plurality of beams, and each beam may then be subsequently processed in the manner described below. In some implementations, the plurality of points on the eyeball may be monitored by successively by the single point radiation (e.g., by scanning the single point of radiation to each of the plurality of points on the eyeball in succession). Although in these implementations the points on the eyeball may not be monitored absolutely simultaneously, the single point radiation may be provided to each of the plurality of points on the eyeball quickly enough that the resulting collection of data may be processed as if the plurality of points had been monitored simultaneously. In some implementations, a hybrid approach may be implemented in which the beams provided by laser radar system 310 as a single point of radiation may be divided to provide a plurality of points of radiation, and each of the plurality of points of radiation may be scanned successively to different points on the eyeball (and\/or individual 112). According to various embodiments of the invention, laser section 374 may include a laser source controller 336, a first laser source 318, a first optical coupler 322, a first beam delay 344, a first local oscillator optical coupler 330, and\/or other components. Second laser radar section 376 may include a laser source controller 338, a second laser source 320, a second optical coupler 324, a second beam delay 350, a second local oscillator optical coupler 332 and\/or other components. For example, some or all of the components of each of laser radar sections 374 and 376 may be obtained as a coherent laser radar system from Metris USA. Coherent laser radar systems from Metris USA may provide various advantages, such as enhanced linearity functionality, enhanced phase wandering correction, and other advantages to laser radar system 310 in determining the range and the range rate of target 316. In some embodiments of the invention, first target beam 312 and second target beam 314 may be reflected by target 316 back toward laser radar system 310. Laser radar system 310 may receive first target beam 312 and second target beam 314, and may determine at least one of a range of target 316 from laser radar system 310, and a range rate of target 316. According to various embodiments of the invention, first laser source 318 may have a first carrier frequency. First laser source 318 may emit a first laser beam 340 at a first frequency. The first frequency may be modulated at a first chirp rate. The first frequency may be modulated electrically, mechanically, acousto-optically, or otherwise modulated as would be apparent. First laser beam 340 may be divided by first optical coupler 322 into first target beam 312 and a first local oscillator beam 342. First local oscillator beam 342 may be held for a first delay period at a first beam delay 344. In some embodiments of the invention, second laser source 320 may emit a second laser beam 346 at a second frequency. The second frequency may be modulated at a second chirp rate different from the first chirp rate. The second frequency may be modulated electrically, mechanically, acousto-optically, or otherwise modulated. The first chirp rate and the second chirp rate may create a counter chirp between first laser beam 340 and second laser beam 346. In some instances, the second carrier frequency may be substantially the same as the first carrier frequency. For example, in some embodiments the percentage difference between the first baseline frequency and the second baseline frequency is less than 0.05%. This may provide various enhancements to laser system 310, such as, for example, minimizing distortion due to speckle, or other enhancements. Second laser beam 346 may be divided by second optical coupler 324 into a second target beam 314 and a second local oscillator beam 348. Second local oscillator beam 348 may be held for a second delay period at a second beam delay 350. The second delay period may be different than the first delay period. In some embodiments, the output(s) of first laser source 318 and\/or second laser source 320 (e.g. first laser beam 340 and\/or second laser beam 346) may be linearized using mechanisms provided in, for example, Metris USA Model MV200. Phase wandering of the output(s) of first laser source 318 and\/or second laser source 320 may be corrected using mechanisms provided in, for instance, Metris USA Model MV200. In some embodiments of the invention, laser radar system 310 may determine the range and the range rate of target 316 with an increased accuracy when the range of target 316 from laser radar system 310 falls within a set of ranges between a minimum range and a maximum range. When the range of target 316 does not fall within the set of ranges, the accuracy of laser radar system 310 may be degraded. According to various embodiments of the invention, first beam delay 344 and second beam delay 350 may be adjustable. Adjusting first beam delay 344 and second beam delay 350 may enable laser radar system 310 to be adjusted to bring the set of ranges over which more accurate determinations may be made closer to, or further away from, laser radar system 310. First beam delay 344 and the second beam delay 350 may be adjusted to ensure that the range of target 316 falls within the set of ranges between the minimum range and the maximum range so that the range and the range rate of target 316 may be determined accurately. First beam delay 344 and second beam delay 350 may be adjusted by a user, or in an automated manner. The degradation of determinations of range and range rate when the range of target 316 is outside of the set of ranges may be a result of the finite nature of the coherence length of first laser source 318 and second laser source 320. For example, the distance between the minimum range and the maximum range may be a function of the coherence length. The longer the coherence length of first laser source 318 and second laser source 320, the greater the distance between the minimum range and the maximum range may be. Thus, increasing the coherence length of first laser source 318 and second laser source 320 may enhance range and range rate determinations by laser radar system 310 by providing the ability to make determinations over an enhanced set of ranges. In some embodiments of the invention, first local oscillator beam 342 may be divided into a plurality of first local oscillator beams and second local oscillator beam 348 may be divided into a plurality of second local oscillator beams. In such instances, laser radar system 310 may include a plurality of beam delays that may apply delays of varying delay periods to the plurality of first local oscillator beams and the plurality of second local oscillator beams. This may ensure that one of the plurality of first local oscillator beams and one of the plurality of second local oscillator beams may have been delayed for delay periods that may enable the range and range rate of the target to be determined accurately. Accordingly, in some embodiments of the invention, first laser source 318 and second laser source 320 may emit chirped electromagnetic radiation with an enhanced coherence length. For example, first laser source 318 and\/or second laser source 320 may include system 310 as illustrated in FIG. 3 and described above. According to various embodiments, first target beam 312 and second target beam 314 may be directed and\/or received from target 316 on separate optical paths. In some embodiments, these optical paths may be similar but distinct. In other embodiments, first target beam 312 and second target beam 314 may be coupled by a target optical coupler 326 into a combined target beam 352 prior to emission that may be directed toward target 316 along a common optical path. In some embodiments, combined target beam 352 (or first target beam 312 and second target beam 314, if directed toward target 316 separately) may be reflected by target 316 and may be received by laser radar system 310 along a reception optical path separate from the common optical path that directed combined target beam 352 toward target 316. Such embodiments may be labeled \u201cbistatic.\u201d Or, combined target beam 352 may be received by laser radar system 310 as a reflected target beam 356 along the common optical path. These latter embodiments may be labeled \u201cmonostatic.\u201d Monostatic embodiments may provide advantages over their bistatic counterparts when operating with reciprocal optics. In monostatic embodiments, the common optical path may include optical member 328 that may provide a common port for emitting combined target beam 352 and receiving reflected target beam 356. Optical member 328 may include an optical circulator, an optical coupler or other optical member as would be apparent. In some embodiments, the common optical path may include a scanning element 337. Scanning element 337 may include an optical element such as, for instance, a mirror, a lens, an antenna, or other optical elements that may be oscillated, rotated, or otherwise actuated to enable combined target beam 352 to scan target 316. In some instances, scanning element 337 may enable scanning at high speeds. In conventional systems, scanning elements may be a source of mirror differential Doppler noise effects due to speckle or other optical effects that may degrade the accuracy of these systems. However, because various embodiments of laser radar system 310 use simultaneous measurements (or substantially so) to unambiguously determine range and range rate, inaccuracies otherwise induced by high speed scanning may be avoided. In some embodiments of the invention, a target optical coupler 354 may divide reflected target beam 356 into a first reflected target beam portion 358 and a second reflected target beam portion 360. First local oscillator optical coupler 330 may combine first local oscillator beam 342 with first reflected target beam portion 358 into a first combined target beam 362. Second local oscillator optical coupler 332 may combine second local oscillator beam 348 with second reflected target beam portion 360 into a second combined target beam 364. In some embodiments not shown in the drawings, where, for example first target beam 312 and second target beam 314 may be directed to and\/or received from target 316 separately, first local oscillator optical coupler 330 may combine first target beam 312 that is reflected with first local oscillator beam 342 to create first combined target beam 362, and second target beam 314 that is reflected may be combined with second local oscillator beam 348 to create second combined target beam 364. Because first local oscillator beam 342 and second local oscillator beam 348 may be combined with different target beams, or different portions of the same target beam (e.g. reflected target beam 356), first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364 may represent optical signals that might be present in two separate, but coincident, single laser source frequency modulated laser radar systems, just prior to final processing. For example, laser source controller 336, first laser source 318, first optical coupler 322, first beam delay 344, and first local oscillator optical coupler 330 may be viewed as a first laser radar section 374 that may generate first combined target beam 362 separate from second combined target beam 364 that may be generated by a second laser radar section 376. Second laser radar section 376 may include laser source controller 338, second laser source 320, second optical coupler 324, second beam delay 350, and second local oscillator optical coupler 332. In some embodiments, laser radar system 310 may include a processor 334. Processor 334 may include a detection module 366, a mixing module 368, a processing module 370, and\/or other modules. The modules may be implemented in hardware (including optical and detection components), software, firmware, or a combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. Processor 334 may receive first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364. Based on first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364, processor 334 may generate the range signal and the range rate signal. Based on the range signal and the range rate signal, the range and the range rate of target 316 may be unambiguously determined. In some embodiments of the invention, processor 334 may determine a first beat frequency of first combined local oscillator beam 362. The first beat frequency may include a difference in frequency, attributable to a difference in path length, of first local oscillator beam 342 and the component of reflected target beam 356 that corresponds to first target beam 312 that has been reflected from target 316. Processor 334 may determine a second beat frequency of second combined local oscillator beam 364. The second beat frequency may include a difference in frequency, attributable to a difference in path length, of second local oscillator beam 348 and the component of reflected target beam 356 that corresponds to second target beam 314 that has been reflected from target 316. The first beat frequency and the second beat frequency may be determined simultaneously (or substantially so) to cancel noise introduced by environmental or other effects. One or more steps may be taken to enable the first beat frequency and the second beat frequency to be distinguished from other frequency components within first combined target beam 362, other frequency components within second combined target beam 364, and\/or each other. For example, these measures may include using two separate chirp rates as the first chirp rate and the second chirp rate, delaying first local oscillator beam 342 and second local oscillator beam 350 for different delay times at first beam delay 344 and second beam delay 350, respectively, or other measures may be taken. It will be appreciated that while FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the invention implemented primarily using optical fibers and optical couplers, this embodiment is in no way intended to be limiting. Alternate embodiments within the scope of the invention exist in which other optical elements such as, for example, prisms, mirrors, half-mirrors, beam splitters, dichroic films, dichroic prisms, lenses, or other optical elements may be used to direct, combine, direct, focus, diffuse, amplify, or otherwise process electromagnetic radiation. According to various embodiments of the invention, processor 334 may mix first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364 to produce a mixed signal. The mixed signal may include a beat frequency sum component that may correspond to the sum of the first beat frequency and the second beat frequency, and a beat frequency difference component that may correspond to the difference between the first beat frequency and the second beat frequency. For a target having constant velocity, first laser beam 340 and second laser beam 346 beat frequencies may be described as follows: f 1 \ue8a0 ( t ) = 4 \ue89e \u03c0 \ue89e \ue89e v \u03bb 1 + 2 \ue89e \ue89e \u03c0 \ue89e \ue89e \u03b3 1 \ue8a0 ( R - R \ue89e \ue89e O 1 ) , and ( 1 ) f 2 \ue8a0 ( t ) = 4 \ue89e \u03c0 \ue89e \ue89e v \u03bb 2 + 2 \ue89e \u03c0\u03b3 2 \ue8a0 ( R - R \ue89e \ue89e O 2 ) , respectively , ( 2 ) where f1(t) represents the first beat frequency, f2(t) represents the second beat frequency, \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the two optical wavelengths, v is the target velocity, \u03b31 and \u03b32 are proportional to the respective chirp rates, R is the measured range and RO1 and RO2 represent the range offsets for the two laser radars. Now assume that \u03bb1=\u03bb2=\u03bb. We may subtract the equations to yield f1(t)\u2212f2(t)=2\u03c0R(\u03b31\u2212\u03b32)\u22122\u03c0(\u03b31RO1\u03b32RO2) (3) Rearranging (3) we obtain R = ( f 1 \ue8a0 ( t ) - f 2 \ue8a0 ( t ) ) 2 \ue89e \u03c0 \ue8a0 ( \u03b3 1 - \u03b3 2 ) + ( \u03b3 1 \ue89e R \ue89e \ue89e O 1 - \u03b3 2 \ue89e R \ue89e \ue89e O 2 ) ( \u03b3 1 - \u03b3 2 ) ( 4 ) as the corrected range measurement. Similarly we may combine (1) and (2) to obtain the expression, v = \u03bb 4 \ue89e \u03c0 \ue89e ( f 1 \ue8a0 ( t ) - \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 \ue89e f 2 \ue8a0 ( t ) 1 - \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 ) + \u03bb\u03b3 1 2 \ue89e ( R \ue89e \ue89e O 1 - R \ue89e \ue89e O 2 1 - \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 ) , ( 5 ) which provides a measure of the target velocity. According to various embodiments of the invention, the beat frequency sum component, described above in Equation 4, may be filtered from the mixed signal to produce a range signal. From the beat frequency sum component included in the range signal (e.g. f1(t)+f2(t)), a determination of the distance from laser radar system 310 to target 316 may be made. The determination based on the range signal may be unambiguous, and may not depend on either the instantaneous behavior, or the average behavior of the Doppler frequency shift (e.g. v\/\u03bb). In some embodiments, the beat frequency difference component, described above in Equation 4, may be filtered from the mixed signal to produce a range rate signal. From the beat frequency difference component included in the range rate signal, a determination of the range rate of target 316 may be unambiguously made. To determine the range rate of target 316, f 1 \ue8a0 ( t ) - \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 \ue89e f 2 \ue8a0 ( t ) may be represented as a value proportional to a chirp rate difference between the first chirp rate and the second chirp rate. This may enable the Doppler shift information to be extracted, which may represent an instantaneous velocity (i.e., range rate) of target 316. In some embodiments of the invention, the second chirp rate may be set to zero. In other words, second laser source 318 may emit radiation at a constant frequency. This may enable second laser source 318 to be implemented with a simpler design, a small footprint, a lighter weight, a decreased cost, or other enhancements that may provide advantages to the overall system. In such embodiments, laser radar system 310 may include a frequency shifting device. The frequency shifting device may include an acousto-optical modulator 372, or other device. Acousto-optical modulator 372 may provide a frequency offset to second local oscillator beam 348, which may enhance downstream processing. For example, the frequency offset may enable a stationary target beat frequency between second local oscillator beam 348 and second reflected target beam portion 360 representative of a range rate of a stationary target to be offset from zero so that the a direction of the target's movement, as well as a magnitude of the rate of the movement, may be determined from the beat frequency. This embodiment of the invention has the further advantage that it may allow for continuous monitoring of the target range rate, uninterrupted by chirp turn-around or fly-back. Chirp turn-around or fly-back may create time intervals during which accurate measurements may be impossible for a chirped laser radar section. In these embodiments, laser radar section 376 may only determine the range rate of target 316 while laser radar system 310 retains the ability to measure both range and range rate. FIG. 4 illustrates a processor 334 according to one embodiment of the invention. Processor 334 may mix first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364 digitally. For example, processor 334 may include a first detector 410 and a second detector 412. The first detector 410 may receive first combined target beam 362 and may generate a first analog signal that corresponds to first combined target beam 362. The first analog signal may be converted to a first digital signal by a first converter 414. Processor 334 may include a first frequency data module 416 that may determine a first set of frequency data that corresponds to one or more frequency components of the first digital signal. In some instances, the first digital signal may be averaged at a first averager module 418. In such instances, the averaged first digital signal may then be transmitted to first frequency data module 416. Second detector 412 may receive second combined target beam 364 and may generate a second analog signal that corresponds to second combined target beam 364. The second analog signal may be converted to a second digital signal by a second converter 420. Processor 334 may include a second frequency data module 422 that may determine a second set of frequency data that corresponds to one or more of frequency components of the second digital signal. In some instances, the second digital signal may be averaged at a second averager module 424. In such instances, the averaged second digital signal may then be transmitted to second frequency data module 422. The first set of frequency data and the second set of frequency data may be received by a frequency data combination module 426. Frequency data combination module 426 may linearly combine the first set of frequency data and the second set of frequency data, and may generate a range rate signal and a range signal derived from the mixed frequency data. FIG. 5 illustrates a processor 334 according to another embodiment of the invention. Processor 334 may include a first detector 510 and a second detector 512 that may receive first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364, respectively. First detector 510 and second detector 512 may generate a first analog signal and a second analog signal associated with first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364, respectively. Processor 334 may mix first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364 electronically to generate the range signal and the range rate signal. For example, processor 334 may include a modulator 514. Modulator 514 may multiply the first analog signal generated by first detector 510 and the second analog signal generated by second detector 512 to create a combined analog signal. In such embodiments, processor 334 may include a first filter 516 and a second filter 518 that receive the combined analog signal. First filter 516 may filter the combined analog signal to generate a first filtered signal. In some instances, first filter 516 may include a low-pass filter. The first filtered signal may be converted by a first converter 520 to generate the range rate signal. Second filter 518 may filter the combined analog signal to generate a second filtered signal. For instance, second filter 518 may include a high-pass filter. The second filtered signal may be converted by a second converter 522 to generate the range signal. FIG. 6 illustrates a processor 334 according to yet another embodiment of the invention. Processor 334 may mix first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364 optically to generate the range signal and the range rate signal. For example, processor 334 may include a detector 610 that receives first combined target beam 362 and second combined target beam 364 and generates a combined analog signal based on the detection. In such embodiments, processor 334 may include a first filter 612 and a second filter 614 that receive the combined analog signal. First filter 612 may filter the combined analog signal to generate a first filtered signal. First filter 612 may include a low-pass filter. The first filtered signal may be converted by a first converter 616 to generate the range rate signal. Second filter 614 may filter the combined analog signal to generate a second filtered signal. Second filter 14 may include a high-pass filter. The second filtered signal may be converted by a second converter 618 to generate the range signal.

The following detailed description will generally follow the summary of the disclosure, as set forth above, further explaining and expanding the definitions of the various aspects and embodiments of the disclosure as necessary. FIGS. 1 through 6 depict a wearable system that senses a user's fingertip movements and converts the fingertip movements to characters that are displayed on a display. The wearable system does not require a physical or virtual input device, such as a keyboard or mouse. Instead, the user imagines a grid, such as a JiuGongGe 3\u00d73 grid (imaginary grid 140), and moves fingers based on the imaginary grid. The user may switch modes (upper case, lower case, digital mode) as well as input method editors (IMEs) such as Latin, Pin Yin\/Chinese, Romani\/Japanese, or other types of Romanized phonetic-based input systems using a designated finger or thumb. FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram depicting a wearable system detecting fingertip movements formed by a user based on an imaginary grid and converting the fingertip movements to characters that are displayed on a display. User 100 wears wearable system 120, which converts fingertip movements 150 into characters that are displayed on display 130 (see FIG. 2 and corresponding text for further details). User 100 imagines imagery grid 140 to determine which fingertip movements to perform. Specifically, imaginary grid 140 only exists in the user's mind and is not a physical device or virtual device. As such, user 100 may be moving or standing and still enter information using fingertip movements 150. In one embodiment, imaginary grid 140 is a (JiuGongGe) JGG 3\u00d73 grid such as that shown in FIG. 1. JGG is widely accepted in Eastern Asia and other areas in the world and, as such, does not entail a substantial learning curve for a user. FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram depicting fingertip movements associated with an imaginary grid. User 100 imagines imaginary grid 140 and moves fingers 210, 220, and 230 to select various characters on imaginary grid 140. As those skilled in the art can appreciate, a user may configure wearable system 120 such that different hands, different fingers, and different fingertip movements may be mapped to characters in a different manner than what is shown in FIG. 2. FIG. 2 shows that user 100 moves the user's index finger 210 according to patterns 240, which is based on imaginary grid 140, to select the following characters: H: Point; G: Point, move left; I: Point, move right; Q: Point, move down; P: Point, move down, move left; R: Point, move down, move right; and S: Point, move down, move right, move down. Similarly, FIG. 2 shows that user 100 moves the user's middle finger 220 according to patterns 250 (based on imaginary grid 140) to select the following characters: K: Point; J: Point, move left; L: Point, move right; B: Point, move up; A: Point, move up, move left; C: Point, move up, move right; U: Point, move down; T: Point, move down, move left; V: Point, move down, move right. And, FIG. 2 shows that user 100 moves the user's ring finger 230 according to patterns 260 (based on imaginary grid 140) to select the following characters: N: Point; M: Point, move left; O: Point, move right; E: Point, move up; D: Point, move up, move left; F: Point, move up, move right; X: Point, move down; W: Point, move down, move left; Y: Point, move down, move right; and Z: Point, move down, move right, move down. In one embodiment, user 100 may move the user's thumb 200, or other fingers, to switch modes (upper\/lower case, digit mode, etc.) or switch to a different IME, such as to a Pinyin IME or Romaji IME (see FIGS. 3-5, 7 and corresponding text for further details). FIG. 3 is a high level diagram showing a wearable system that converts fingertip movements to information that is understandable by a computing system. Wearable system 120 includes fingertip IME 300, which uses various components to detect fingertip movements and convert the fingertip movements to characters and control requests. In one embodiment, fingertip IME 300 may be an IME wrapper or IME shell of Romanized phonetic-based IME's included in wearable system 120. Fingertip movement sensor 305 monitors user 100's fingertip movements and converts the fingertip movements to digitized signals 310. In one embodiment, fingertip movement sensor 305 may use infrared technology, optical technology, wired technology, etc. to detect fingertip movement. In another embodiment, user 100 may wear a digitized glove with receptors detected by fingertip movement sensor 305. Fingertip input recognition daemon 320 analyzes digitized signals 310 and determines which finger\/thumb moved and in which pattern. The example in FIG. 3 shows that fingertip input recognition daemon 320 determined that the user's ring finger pointed, moved up, and to the left. In one embodiment, fingertip input recognition daemon 320 may be trained by user 100 to detect user 100's fingertip movements. For example, user 100 may be a person with long fingers and may train fingertip input recognition daemon 320 to the person's upper and lower fingertip movement extremes, which would be different than a person with short fingers. Fingertip movement converter 340 receives fingertip movements 330 and uses movement conversion table 345 to convert fingertip movements 330 to key entries 355 (alphabet characters, numbers, etc.) or control requests 350 (IME change, mode change, etc.). Control requests 350 may directly invoke another IME through IME selection 360, which switches active IME 370 to a different IME, such as IME 500 shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 4 shows an example of movement conversion table 345, which corresponds to the example shown in FIG. 2 and includes examples of control requests 350 corresponding to thumb movement patterns in rows 490. When fingertip movement converter 340 determines a key entry conversion, fingertip movement converter 340 sends key entry 355 to active IME 370. FIG. 3 shows that fingertip movement converter 340 converted fingertip movements 330 to the letter \u201cD\u201d based on movement conversion table 345. Active IME 370 processes key entry 355 and displays information on display 130 accordingly. The example in FIG. 3 shows that active IME 370 is a Latin IME and, as such, passes \u201cD\u201d to display 130. FIG. 5 shows an example when the active IME is a Pinyin\/Chinese IME, which receives the letter \u201cD\u201d and displays correlated Chinese character candidates accordingly. FIG. 4 is an exemplary diagram depicting a table that maps fingertip movements to particular key entries or control requests. Movement conversion table 345 maps fingertip movement patterns 405 to key entries, IME selections, and mode selections 410 based upon which finger\/thumb and corresponding fingertip movement. Rows 415, 440, and 470 show middle finger movements mapped to specific characters, which correspond to middle finger movements 250 shown in FIG. 2. Rows 430 and 460 show index finger movements mapped to specific characters, which correspond to index finger movements 240 shown in FIG. 2. Rows 420, 450, and 480 show ring finger movements mapped to specific characters, which correspond to ring finger movements 260 shown in FIG. 2. Rows 490 show thumb finger movements mapped to specific IME selection control requests and mode selection control requests. For example, a user may point the user's thumb to switch IME's to a Romaji IME, or point the user's thumb and move the thumb right to switch to a Digital input mode (e.g., 0-9, #, $, etc.). FIG. 5 is a high level diagram similar to that shown in FIG. 3 with the exception of wearable system 120 using a different active IME. User 100 may have moved the user's thumb to switch the active IME from a Latin IME to Pinyin\/Chinese IME 500. FIG. 5 shows that when active IME 500 receives key entry 355 of \u201cd,\u201d active IME 500 searches all Chinese characters whose pronunciation starts with \u201cd\u201d, such as da, dai, dao, and displays the options on display 130. Active IME 500 then waits for more input from fingertip movement converter 340 to refine the options (see FIG. 7 and corresponding text for further details). FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing steps taken to detect fingertip movements and convert the fingertip movements to key entries and control requests. FIG. 6 processing commences at 600 whereupon, at step 605, the process loads a default input mode and IME, such as loading a Latin IME in an upper case mode. At step 615, the process senses fingertip movements by a user and converts the fingertip movements to digitized signals. As discussed earlier, the fingertip movements may be from a thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, or pinky finger. At step 620, the process converts the digitized signals to fingertip movements, such as \u201cINDEX FINGER: POINT, DOWN.\u201d At step 625, the process converts the fingertip movements to a key entry or a control request based on movement conversion table 345, such as an IME selection or a mode selection. For example, if the identified fingertip movement is \u201cINDEX FINGER: POINT, DOWN,\u201d the process converts the fingertip movement to \u201cQ\u201d (see FIGS. 2, 4, and corresponding text for further details). The process determines as to whether the fingertip movement conversion is a key entry or a control request (decision 630). For example, the process may determine that the identified fingertip movement may from a thumb that is \u201cpoint, left, down,\u201d which corresponds to switching to lower case per movement conversion table 345 shown in FIG. 4. If the fingertip movement conversion corresponds to a control action, then decision 630 branches to the \u201cIME\/Mode Selection\u201d branch, which loops back to change the input mode or change the IME to one of IMEs 610 (step 635) and continue processing fingertip movements. On the other hand, if the fingertip movement conversion is a key entry, decision 630 branches to the \u201cKey Entry\u201d branch. At step 640, the process displays a character on display 130 based on the active IME, such as the letter \u201cK.\u201d The process determines as to whether to commit the character, such as committing the character to a message (decision 645). For example, the process may wait an amount of time, such as 1 second, before committing the character to allow the user a chance to remove the character, such as by performing a \u201cbackspace\u201d fingertip movement or shaking a display attached to the user's wrist. In another example, the active IME may be a Pinyin\/Chinese IME and not commit the characters until a certain amount of characters are determined. If the process should commit the character, then decision 645 branches to the \u2018yes\u2019 branch. At step 650, the process commits the character, such as by adding the character to a message. On the other hand, if the process should not commit the character, then decision 645 branches to the \u2018no\u2019 branch and bypasses step 650. The process determines as to whether to continue (decision 655). If the process should continue, then decision 655 branches to the \u2018yes\u2019 branch which loops back to sense more fingertip movements. This looping continues until the process should terminate, at which point decision 655 branches to the \u2018no\u2019 branch exiting the loop. At step 660, the process performs an action, such as sending a message or accessing a website based on the information that is displayed on display 130. FIG. 6 processing thereafter ends at 695. FIG. 7 illustrates information handling system 700, which is a simplified example of a computer system capable of performing the computing operations described herein. Information handling system 700 includes one or more processors 710 coupled to processor interface bus 712.

Online systems, such as social networking systems, allow users to connect to and to communicate with other users of the online system. Users may create profiles on an online system that are tied to their identities and include information about the users, such as interests and demographic information. The users may be individuals or entities such as corporations or charities. Online systems allow users to easily communicate and to share content with other online system users by providing content to an online system for presentation to other users. Content provided to an online system by a user may be declarative information provided by a user, status updates, check-ins to locations, images, photographs, videos, text data, or any other information a user wishes to share with additional users of the online system. An online system may also generate content for presentation to a user, such as content describing actions taken by other users on the online system. Additionally, many online systems commonly allow users (e.g., businesses) to sponsor presentation of content on an online system to gain public attention for a user's products or services or to persuade other users to take an action regarding the user's products or services. Content for which the online system receives compensation in exchange for presenting to users is referred to as \u201csponsored content.\u201d Many online systems receive compensation from a user for presenting online system users with certain types of sponsored content provided by the user. Frequently, online systems charge a user for each presentation of sponsored content to an online system user or for each interaction with sponsored content by an online system user. For example, an online system receives compensation from an entity each time a content item provided by the user is displayed to another user on the online system or each time another user is presented with a content item on the online system and interacts with the content item (e.g., selects a link included in the content item), or each time another user performs another action after being presented with the content item (e.g., visits a physical location associated with the user who provided the content item). When providing sponsored content items to an online system for presentation to users of the online system, a user may provide parameters for limiting presentation of the sponsored content items by the online system. For example, a user specifies a time limit and a budget for the online system to present sponsored content items provided by the user to other users. When the time limit expires, the online system stops presenting the sponsored content items from the user, even if the budget is not exhausted. Similarly, when the budget is exhausted, the online system stops presenting the sponsored content items from the user to other users, even if the time limit specified by the user has not expired. Hence, the advertising campaign may be presented to users either until the budget is exhausted or the time limit expires. Additionally, the user may specify frequency limits for various sponsored content items along with the time limit, with a frequency limit for a sponsored content item specifying a maximum number of times the sponsored content item is presented to another user during the time limit. However, pacing presentation of sponsored content items received from a user over a time limit specified by the user allows the sponsored content items to be presented to other users for the full duration of the time limit. Because conventional methods for selecting sponsored content for presentation by an online system identify sponsored content items eligible for presentation to another user and determine whether to present the identified sponsored content items, fluctuations in the number of online system users eligible to be presented with sponsored content items provided by a user may affect how rapidly a budget of the advertising campaign is exhausted. Similarly, fluctuations in a number of opportunities to present sponsored content items to a particular online system user affects how rapidly presentation of a sponsored content item from the user to the particular online system user reaches the frequency limit for the sponsored content item. As prediction of the number of opportunities to present sponsored content items to various online system users is difficult to accurately predict before the opportunities are identified and an amount a user is willing to compensate the online system for presenting sponsored content items to other online system users may vary over time, conventional methods for selecting sponsored content items by an online system limit a user's ability to regulate frequencies with which sponsored content items are presented to other users throughout a time interval.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An online system maintains advertisement requests (\u201cad requests\u201d) in an advertising campaign and identifies one or more ad requests from the ad campaign for inclusion in one or more selection processes when an opportunity to present one or more advertisements to a user of the online system is identified. The advertising campaign includes multiple ad requests and is associated with a budget and a duration. Additionally, various ad requests in the ad campaign are associated with frequency limits, where a frequency limit associated with an ad request specifying a maximum number of times an advertisement from the ad request is presented to a user during the duration of the ad campaign. To allow a frequency limit for an ad request in the advertising campaign to be completed over the duration associated with the advertising campaign, the online system modifies bid amounts associated with the ad request in different selection processes performed when opportunities to present one or more advertisements to a user are identified. The online system modifies a bid amount associated with the ad request in a selection process for an opportunity to present one or more advertisements to a user based on a frequency limit associated with the ad request, a number of times an advertisement in the ad request has previously been presented to the user during the duration of the advertising campaign, and an amount of the duration of the advertising campaign that has lapsed. In various embodiments, when the online system includes an ad request from the advertising campaign in a selection process selecting content for presentation to a user, the online system determines an adjustment value for a bid amount associated with the ad request based on a frequency limit associated with the ad request. To determine the adjustment value, the online system determines an amount of revenue received by the online system per impression of advertisements to the user during a time interval. For example, the online system determines a ratio of an amount of revenue received from presenting advertisements to the user during a month prior to a current time to a number of impressions of advertisements to the user during the month prior to the current time. The online system determines the adjustment value by modifying the amount of revenue received by the online system per impression of advertisements to the user during the time interval by a value based on the frequency limit for the ad request, a number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user, the duration for the ad campaign, and an amount of the duration for the ad campaign that has lapsed. For example, the online system determines a number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user by scaling the frequency limit for the ad request by a ratio of the amount of the duration for the ad campaign that has lapsed to the duration for the ad campaign. The online system determines the adjustment value based on a ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user. In one embodiment, if the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is less than a threshold value (e.g., one), the adjustment value increases the bid amount associated with the ad request; conversely, if the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is greater than a threshold value (e.g., one), the adjustment value decreases the bid amount associated with the ad request. Different adjustment values may be applied to the bid amount depending on whether the adjustment value increases or decreases the bid amount. For example, the adjustment value decreases the bid amount because the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is greater than a threshold value, the adjustment value decreases the bid amount by a greater amount than if the adjustment value increases the bid amount. As an example, if the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is greater than a threshold value, the adjustment value is determined via a cubic function, while if the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is less than the threshold value, the adjustment value is determined via a linear function. Hence, in the preceding example, the adjustment value decreases the bid amount associated with the ad request by a greater amount than the adjustment value increases the bid amount associated with the ad request. Modifying the bid amount associated with an ad request based on a number of times an advertisement from the ad request has been presented to a user as well as a frequency limit for the ad request allows the online system to more evenly distribute impressions of the advertisement to a user throughout a specified duration while maintaining a budget for presentation of the advertisement. Determining how to adjust a bid amount associated with the ad request when an opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user allows more accurate modification of ad request bid amounts to account for frequency limits during the specified duration. Additionally, modifying a bid amount associated with the ad request based on the number of times the advertisement from the ad request has been presented during the duration and the frequency limit for the ad request allows for more efficient computation of bid amount modification, conserving computing resources and reducing time to determine modification of the bid amount.","description":"BACKGROUND This disclosure relates generally to presenting content in an online system, and more specifically to pacing of a budget by a user for presenting sponsored content to other users via an online system.

SUMMARY An online system maintains advertisement requests (\u201cad requests\u201d) in an advertising campaign and identifies one or more ad requests from the ad campaign for inclusion in one or more selection processes when an opportunity to present one or more advertisements to a user of the online system is identified. The advertising campaign includes multiple ad requests and is associated with a budget and a duration. Additionally, various ad requests in the ad campaign are associated with frequency limits, where a frequency limit associated with an ad request specifying a maximum number of times an advertisement from the ad request is presented to a user during the duration of the ad campaign. To allow a frequency limit for an ad request in the advertising campaign to be completed over the duration associated with the advertising campaign, the online system modifies bid amounts associated with the ad request in different selection processes performed when opportunities to present one or more advertisements to a user are identified. The online system modifies a bid amount associated with the ad request in a selection process for an opportunity to present one or more advertisements to a user based on a frequency limit associated with the ad request, a number of times an advertisement in the ad request has previously been presented to the user during the duration of the advertising campaign, and an amount of the duration of the advertising campaign that has lapsed. In various embodiments, when the online system includes an ad request from the advertising campaign in a selection process selecting content for presentation to a user, the online system determines an adjustment value for a bid amount associated with the ad request based on a frequency limit associated with the ad request. To determine the adjustment value, the online system determines an amount of revenue received by the online system per impression of advertisements to the user during a time interval. For example, the online system determines a ratio of an amount of revenue received from presenting advertisements to the user during a month prior to a current time to a number of impressions of advertisements to the user during the month prior to the current time. The online system determines the adjustment value by modifying the amount of revenue received by the online system per impression of advertisements to the user during the time interval by a value based on the frequency limit for the ad request, a number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user, the duration for the ad campaign, and an amount of the duration for the ad campaign that has lapsed. For example, the online system determines a number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user by scaling the frequency limit for the ad request by a ratio of the amount of the duration for the ad campaign that has lapsed to the duration for the ad campaign. The online system determines the adjustment value based on a ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user. In one embodiment, if the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is less than a threshold value (e.g., one), the adjustment value increases the bid amount associated with the ad request; conversely, if the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is greater than a threshold value (e.g., one), the adjustment value decreases the bid amount associated with the ad request. Different adjustment values may be applied to the bid amount depending on whether the adjustment value increases or decreases the bid amount. For example, the adjustment value decreases the bid amount because the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is greater than a threshold value, the adjustment value decreases the bid amount by a greater amount than if the adjustment value increases the bid amount.

Hence, in the preceding example, the adjustment value decreases the bid amount associated with the ad request by a greater amount than the adjustment value increases the bid amount associated with the ad request. Modifying the bid amount associated with an ad request based on a number of times an advertisement from the ad request has been presented to a user as well as a frequency limit for the ad request allows the online system to more evenly distribute impressions of the advertisement to a user throughout a specified duration while maintaining a budget for presentation of the advertisement.

Data exchanged over the network 120 may be represented using any suitable format, such as hypertext markup language (HTML) or extensible markup language (XML). In some embodiments, all or some of the communication links of the network 120 may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques. One or more third party systems 130 may be coupled to the network 120 for communicating with the online system 140, which is further described below in conjunction with FIG. 2. In one embodiment, a third party system 130 is an application provider communicating information describing applications for execution by a client device 110 or communicating data to client devices 110 for use by an application executing on the client device 110. In other embodiments, a third party system 130 provides content or other information for presentation via a client device 110. A third party system 130 may also communicate information to the online system 140, such as advertisements, content, or information about an application provided by the third party system 130. In some embodiments, one or more of the third party systems 130 provide content to the online system 140 for presentation to users of the online system 140 and provide compensation to the online system 140 in exchange for presenting the content. For example, a third party system 130 provides advertisement requests, which are further described below in conjunction with FIG. 2, including advertisements for presentation and amounts of compensation provided by the third party system 130 to the online system 140 in exchange presenting the advertisements to the online system 140. Content presented by the online system 140 for which the online system 140 receives compensation in exchange for presenting is referred to herein as \u201csponsored content,\u201d \u201csponsored content items,\u201d or \u201cadvertisements.\u201d Sponsored content from a third party system 130 may be associated with the third party system 130 or with another entity on whose behalf the third party system 130 operates. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an architecture of the online system 140. The online system 140 shown in FIG. 2 includes a user profile store 205, a content store 210, an action logger 215, an action log 220, an edge store 225, an advertisement (\u201cad\u201d) request store 230, a content selection module 235, and a web server 240. In other embodiments, the online system 140 may include additional, fewer, or different components for various applications. Conventional components such as network interfaces, security functions, load balancers, failover servers, management and network operations consoles, and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system architecture. Each user of the online system 140 is associated with a user profile, which is stored in the user profile store 205. A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the online system 140. In one embodiment, a user profile includes multiple data fields, each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding online system user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic, demographic, and other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, gender, hobbies or preferences, location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user, for example, images or videos. In certain embodiments, images of users may be tagged with information identifying the online system users displayed in an image, with information identifying the images in which a user is tagged stored in the user profile of the user. A user profile in the user profile store 205 may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store 210 and stored in the action log 220. While user profiles in the user profile store 205 are frequently associated with individuals, allowing individuals to interact with each other via the online system 140, user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the online system 140 for connecting and exchanging content with other online system users. The entity may post information about itself, about its products or provide other information to users of the online system 140 using a brand page associated with the entity's user profile. Other users of the online system 140 may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself, providing users with background or informational data about the entity. In some embodiments, the brand page associated with the entity's user profile may retrieve information from one or more user profiles associated with users who have interacted with the brand page or with other content associated with the entity, allowing the brand page to include information personalized to a user when presented to the user. The content store 210 stores objects that each represents various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post, a status update, a photograph, a video, a link, a shared content item, a gaming application achievement, a check-in event at a local business, a brand page, or any other type of content. Online system users may create objects stored by the content store 210, such as status updates, photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the online system 140, events, groups or applications. In some embodiments, objects are received from third-party applications or third-party applications separate from the online system 140. In one embodiment, objects in the content store 210 represent single pieces of content, or content \u201citems.\u201d Hence, online system users are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media to the online system 140 through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the online system 140. The action logger 215 receives communications about user actions internal to and\/or external to the online system 140, populating the action log 220 with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user, sending a message to another user, uploading an image, reading a message from another user, viewing content associated with another user, and attending an event posted by another user. In addition, a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users, so these actions are associated with the particular users as well and stored in the action log 220. The action log 220 may be used by the online system 140 to track user actions on the online system 140, as well as actions on third party systems 130 that communicate information to the online system 140. Users may interact with various objects on the online system 140, and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log 220. Examples of interactions with objects include: commenting on posts, sharing links, checking-in to physical locations via a client device 110, accessing content items, and any other suitable interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the online system 140 that are included in the action log 220 include: commenting on a photo album, communicating with a user, establishing a connection with an object, joining an event, joining a group, creating an event, authorizing an application, using an application, expressing a preference for an object (\u201cliking\u201d the object), engaging in a transaction, viewing an object (e.g., a content item), and sharing an object (e.g., a content item) with another user. Additionally, the action log 220 may record a user's interactions with advertisements on the online system 140 as well as with other applications operating on the online system 140. In some embodiments, data from the action log 220 is used to infer interests or preferences of a user, augmenting the interests included in the user's user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences. The action log 220 may also store user actions taken on a third party system 130, such as an external website, and communicated to the online system 140. For example, an e-commerce website may recognize a user of an online system 140 through a social plug-in enabling the e-commerce website to identify the user of the online system 140. Because users of the online system 140 are uniquely identifiable, e-commerce web sites, such as in the preceding example, may communicate information about a user's actions outside of the online system 140 to the online system 140 for association with the user. Hence, the action log 220 may record information about actions users perform on a third party system 130, including webpage viewing histories, advertisements that were engaged, purchases made, and other patterns from shopping and buying. Additionally, actions a user performs via an application associated with a third party system 130 and executing on a client device 110 may be communicated to the action logger 215 by the application for recordation and association with the user in the action log 220. In one embodiment, the edge store 225 stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the online system 140 as edges. Some edges may be defined by users, allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example, users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users' real-life relationships, such as friends, co-workers, partners, and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the online system 140, such as expressing interest in a page on the online system 140, sharing a link with other users of the online system 140, and commenting on posts made by other users of the online system 140. In one embodiment, an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users, interactions between users and objects, or interactions between objects. For example, features included in an edge describe a rate of interaction between two users, how recently two users have interacted with each other, a rate or an amount of information retrieved by one user about an object, or numbers and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or a particular user. For example, a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic, the rate at which the user logs into the online system 140, or information describing demographic information about the user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user, a target object or user, and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user, the target object or user, or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user; hence, an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions. The edge store 225 also stores information about edges, such as affinity scores for objects, interests, and other users. Affinity scores, or \u201caffinities,\u201d may be computed by the online system 140 over time to approximate a user's interest in an object or in another user in the online system 140 based on the actions performed by the user. A user's affinity may be computed by the online system 140 over time to approximate the user's interest in an object, in a topic, or in another user in the online system 140 based on actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/978,265, filed on Dec. 23, 2010, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/690,254, filed on Nov. 30, 2012, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/689,969, filed on Nov. 30, 2012, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/690,088, filed on Nov. 30, 2012, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store 225, in one embodiment. Alternatively, each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments, connections between users may be stored in the user profile store 205, or the user profile store 205 may access the edge store 225 to determine connections between users. One or more advertisement requests (\u201cad requests\u201d) are included in the ad request store 230. In various embodiments, the ad request store 230 includes one or more advertising campaigns, each advertising campaign including one or more ad requests. Additionally, an advertising campaign is associated with one or more objectives, a duration, and a budget. An objective associated with an advertising campaign describes one or more goals for presentation of advertisements from ad requests included in the advertising campaign. For example, an objective specifies a total number of impressions of advertisements from ad requests in the advertising campaign to users during the duration included in the advertising campaign, specifies a total number of unique online system users to be presented with at least one advertisement from the advertising campaign, a maximum number of times an advertisement from an ad request in the advertising campaign is presented to a user (a \u201cfrequency limit\u201d) within the duration of the advertising campaign, or any other suitable criteria. In some embodiments, different ad requests in the advertising campaign are associated with different frequency limits, allowing advertisements from different ad requests in the ad campaign to be presented to an online system user different numbers of times within the advertising campaign's duration. The budget specifies a total amount of compensation a user (e.g., an advertiser) associated with an advertising campaign provides the online system 140 for presenting advertisements from ad requests in the advertising campaign or for the online system 140 receiving interactions with advertisements from ad requests in the advertising campaign. Additionally, the duration associated with the advertising campaign specifies a time interval during which advertisements from ad requests in the advertising campaign are presented to social networking system users. For example, if the duration of an advertising campaign is 30 days, advertisements included in the advertising campaign are presented to online system users for 30 days after the advertising campaign is provided to the online system 140. In some embodiments, the user providing the advertising campaign may also specify a start date for the advertising campaign, so the duration is measured from the specified start date. An advertising campaign includes one or more ad requests that each describe advertisements in the advertising campaign for presentation to one or more social networking system users. An ad request includes advertisement content, also referred to as an \u201cadvertisement,\u201d and a bid amount. The advertisement is text, image, audio, video, or any other suitable data presented to a user. The advertisement may also include a landing page specifying a network address to which a user is directed when the advertisement content is accessed. In some embodiments, the bid amount is associated with an ad request by a user providing the ad request to the online system 140 and is used to determine an expected value, such as monetary compensation, provided by the user to the online system 140 if an advertisement in the ad request is presented to another user, if the advertisement in the ad request receives an interaction from another user presented with the advertisement, or if any suitable condition is satisfied when the advertisement in the ad request is presented to another user. For example, the bid amount specifies a monetary amount that the online system 140 receives from an advertiser if an advertisement in an ad request is displayed. In some embodiments, the expected value to the online system 140 of presenting the advertisement may be determined by multiplying the bid amount by a probability of the advertisement being accessed by a user. Alternatively, the user providing an ad request to the online system 140 does not associate a bid amount with the ad request, but the online system 140 determines a bid amount for the ad request based on a budget, a duration, or an objective associated with the advertising campaign including the ad request. For example, a pacing factor is determined from the budget associated with an advertising campaign including the ad request and an amount spent by an advertiser on the advertising campaign from a start date of the advertising campaign to a current time. The pacing factor modifies a bid amount associated with various advertisements in the ad campaign, altering spending of the advertising campaign's budget throughout the duration of the advertising campaign. Additionally, an ad request may include one or more targeting criteria specified by the user providing the ad request to the online system 140 (e.g., an advertiser). Targeting criteria included in an ad request specify one or more characteristics of users eligible to be presented with advertisement content in the ad request. For example, targeting criteria are used to identify users having user profile information, edges, or actions satisfying at least one of the targeting criteria. Hence, targeting criteria allow a user to identify other users having specific characteristics, simplifying subsequent distribution of content to different users. In one embodiment, targeting criteria may specify actions or types of connections between a user and another user or object of the online system 140. Targeting criteria may also specify interactions between a user and objects performed external to the online system 140, such as on a third party system 130. For example, targeting criteria identifies users who have taken a particular action, such as sent a message to another user, used an application, joined a group, left a group, joined an event, generated an event description, purchased or reviewed a product or service using an online marketplace, requested information from a third party system 130, installed an application, or performed any other suitable action. Including actions in targeting criteria allows further refinement of users eligible to be presented with an advertisement from an ad request. As another example, targeting criteria identifies users having a connection to another user or object or having a particular type of connection to another user or object. The content selection module 235 selects one or more content items for communication to a client device 110 to be presented to a user. Content items eligible for presentation to the user are retrieved from the content store 210, from the ad request store 230, or from another source by the content selection module 235, which selects one or more of the content items for presentation to the user. A content item eligible for presentation to the user is a content item associated with at least a threshold number of targeting criteria satisfied by characteristics of the user or is a content item that is not associated with targeting criteria. In various embodiments, the content selection module 235 includes content items eligible for presentation to the user in one or more selection processes, which identify a set of content items for presentation to the user. For example, the content selection module 235 determines measures of relevance of various content items to the user based on characteristics associated with the user by the online system 140 and based on the user's affinity for different content items. Information associated with the user included in the user profile store 205, in the action log 220, and in the edge store 225 may be used to determine the measures of relevance. Based on the measures of relevance, the content selection module 235 selects content items for presentation to the user. As an additional example, the content selection module 235 selects content items having the highest measures of relevance or having at least a threshold measure of relevance for presentation to the user. Alternatively, the content selection module 235 ranks content items based on their associated measures of relevance and selects content items having the highest positions in the ranking or having at least a threshold position in the ranking for presentation to the user. Content items selected for presentation to the user may include advertisements from ad requests or other content items associated with bid amounts. The content selection module 235 uses the bid amounts associated with ad requests when selecting content for presentation to the viewing user. In various embodiments, the content selection module 235 determines an expected value associated with various ad requests (or other content items) based on their bid amounts and selects advertisements from ad requests associated with a maximum expected value or associated with at least a threshold expected value for presentation. An expected value associated with an ad request or with a content item represents an expected amount of compensation to the online system 140 for presenting an advertisement from the ad request or for presenting the content item. For example, the expected value associated with an ad request is a product of the ad request's bid amount and a likelihood of the user interacting with the ad content from the ad request. The content selection module 235 may rank ad requests based on their associated bid amounts and select advertisements from ad requests having at least a threshold position in the ranking for presentation to the user. In some embodiments, the content selection module 235 ranks both content items not associated with bid amounts and ad requests in a unified ranking based on bid amounts associated with ad requests and measures of relevance associated with content items and with ad requests. Based on the unified ranking, the content selection module 235 selects content for presentation to the user. Selecting ad requests and other content items through a unified ranking is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/545,266, filed on Jul. 10, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. When selecting one or more advertisements for presentation to a user via an identified opportunity to present one or more advertisements, the content selection module 235 accounts for various characteristics of advertising campaigns including ad requests. If the content selection module 235 identifies an ad request associated with a frequency limit from an advertising campaign having a duration, the content selection module 235 modifies a bid amount associated with the identified ad request to present an advertisement from the ad request to the user throughout the duration of the advertising campaign subject to the frequency limit. To modify the bid amount associated with the identified ad request, the content selection module 235 determines a portion of the advertising campaign's duration that has lapsed and a number of impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request to the user during the lapsed portion of the advertising campaign's duration. Based on the duration of the advertising campaign, the frequency limit associated with the identified ad request, and the lapsed portion of the duration of the advertising campaign, the content selection module 235 determines a potential number of impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request during the lapsed portion of the duration of the advertising campaign. For example, the content selection module 235 scales the frequency limit associated with the identified ad request by a ratio of the lapsed portion of the duration of the advertising campaign to the duration of the advertising campaign to determine the potential number of impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request. The content selection module 235 determines an adjustment value for modifying the bid amount associated with the identified ad request based on a comparison of the impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request to the user during the lapsed portion of the duration to the potential number of impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request to the user during the lapsed portion of the duration. If the number of impressions exceeds the potential number of impressions, the content selection module 235 determines an adjustment value that decreases the bid amount associated with the identified ad request. However, if the number of impressions is less than the potential number of impressions, the content selection module 235 determines an adjustment value that increases the bid amount associated with the identified ad request. Determining an adjustment value based on a frequency cap associated with an ad request is further described below in conjunction with FIGS. 3 and 4. The content selection module 235 includes the identified ad request and its bid amount after modification by the adjustment value in one or more selection processes selecting one or more advertisements for presentation via the opportunity, as further described above. For example, the content selection module 235 receives a request to present a feed of content (also referred to as a \u201ccontent feed\u201d) to a user of the online system 140. The feed may include one or more advertisements as well as content items, such as stories describing actions associated with other online system users connected to the user. The content selection module 235 accesses one or more of the user profile store 205, the content store 210, the action log 220, and the edge store 225 to retrieve information about the user and selects content items based on the retrieved information. For example, information describing actions associated with other users connected to the user or other data associated with users connected to the user is retrieved and used to select content items describing actions associated with one or more of the other users. Additionally, one or more ad requests may be retrieved from the ad request store 230. The retrieved ad requests and other content items are analyzed by the content selection module 235 to identify candidate content items that are likely to be relevant to the user. For example, content items associated with users who not connected to the user or content items associated with users for whom the user has less than a threshold affinity are discarded as candidate content items. Based on various criteria, the content selection module 235 selects one or more of the candidate content items or ad requests identified as candidate content items for presentation to the user. The selected content items or advertisements from selected ad requests are included in a feed of content that is presented to the user. For example, the feed of content includes at least a threshold number of content items describing actions associated with users connected to the user via the online system 140. In various embodiments, the content selection module 235 presents content to a user through a feed including a plurality of content items selected for presentation to the user. One or more advertisements may also be included in the feed. The content selection module 235 may also determine an order in which selected content items or advertisements are presented via the feed. For example, the content selection module 235 orders content items or advertisements in the feed based on likelihoods of the user interacting with various content items or advertisements. The web server 240 links the online system 140 via the network 120 to the one or more client devices 110, as well as to the one or more third party systems 130. The web server 240 serves web pages, as well as other content, such as JAVA\u00ae, FLASH\u00ae, XML and so forth. The web server 240 may receive and route messages between the online system 140 and the client device 110, for example, instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text messages, short message service (SMS) messages, or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server 240 to upload information (e.g., images or videos) that are stored in the content store 210. Additionally, the web server 240 may provide application programming interface (API) functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems, such as IOS\u00ae, ANDROID\u2122, WEBOS\u00ae or BlackberryOS. Modifying Advertisement Request Bid Amounts Based on a Frequency Limit FIG. 3 is a is a flowchart of one embodiment of a method for modifying a bid amount associated with an advertisement request (\u201cad request\u201d) subject to a frequency limit and a budget for presenting the advertisement from the advertisement request. In various embodiments, the steps described in conjunction with FIG. 3 may be performed in different orders than the order described in conjunction with FIG. 3. Additionally, the method may include different and\/or additional steps than those described in conjunction with FIG. 0.3 in some embodiments. The online system 140 receives 305 an advertising campaign including one or more advertisement requests (\u201cad requests\u201d), each ad request including an advertisement for presentation to online system users. The advertising campaign is associated with a duration, one or more objectives, and a budget. As described above in conjunction with FIG. 2, the objective describes one or more goals for actions associated with presentation of advertisements from ad requests in the advertising campaign. For example, an objective specifies a total number of impressions of advertisements from ad requests in the advertising campaign to users during the duration included in the advertising campaign, specifies a total number of unique online system users to be presented with at least one advertisement from the advertising campaign, a maximum number of times an advertisement from an ad request in the advertising campaign is presented to a user (a \u201cfrequency limit\u201d) within the duration of the advertising campaign, or any other suitable criteria. In some embodiments, different ad requests in the advertising campaign are associated with different frequency limits, allowing advertisements from different ad requests in the ad campaign to be presented to an online system user different numbers of times within the advertising campaign's duration. The budget specifies a total amount of compensation a user (e.g., an advertiser) associated with the advertising campaign provides the online system 140 for presenting advertisements from ad requests in the advertising campaign or for the online system 140 receiving interactions with advertisements from ad requests in the advertising campaign. Additionally, the duration associated with the advertising campaign specifies a time interval during which advertisements from ad requests in the advertising campaign are presented to social networking system users. When the online system 140 identifies 310 an opportunity to present one or more advertisements to a user of the online system, the online system 140 identifies 315 an ad request from the advertising campaign eligible for presentation to the user. For example, the online system 140 receives a request for one or more advertisements from a client device 110 associated with the user and identifies 315 an ad request from the ad campaign including at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of targeting criteria satisfied by characteristics of the user. As another example, when the online system 140 receives a request for one or more advertisements from a client device 110 associated with the user, the online system 140 identifies 315 an ad request from the ad campaign that does not include targeting criteria. The ad request identified 315 by the online system 140 is associated with a frequency limit specifying a maximum number of times an advertisement from the identified ad request is presented to the user during the duration associated with the advertising campaign. To pace presentation of the advertisement from the identified ad request throughout the duration associated with the advertising campaign including the ad request, the online system 140 modifies a bid amount associated with the identified ad request. The online system 140 determines 320 a number of times the advertisement from the identified ad request has previously been presented to the user during the duration associated with the advertising campaign. For example, the online system 140 retrieves stored information associated with the user identifying content items presented to the user and times when the content items were presented to the user; based on the retrieved information, the online system 140 determines a number of times an identifier associated with the advertisement from the identified ad request was presented to the user at times within the duration associated with the advertising campaign. Additionally, the online system 140 determines 325 an amount of the duration associated with the advertising campaign that has lapsed when the opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user was identified 310. For example, the online system 140 determines 325 an amount of time from when the advertising campaign was received 305 to a time when the opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user was identified 310. As another example, the online system 140 determines 325 an amount of time between a start time specified by the advertising campaign and a time when the opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user was identified 310. The online system 140 also determines 330 an amount of revenue previously received by the online system 140 per impression of advertisements to the user during a time interval. For example, the online system 140 determines an amount of revenue received from presenting advertisements to the user during a month prior to a time when the opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user was identified 310 and divides the determined amount of revenue by a number of impressions of advertisements to the user during the month prior to the time when the opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user was identified 310. In other embodiments, the online system 140 may determine the amount of revenue previously received based on revenue received by the online system 140 for presenting advertisements to the user and a number of impressions of advertisements to the user during any suitable time interval. Based on the frequency limit associated with the identified ad request, the amount of the duration associated with the advertising campaign that has lapsed when the opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user was identified 310, and the number of times the advertisement from the identified ad request has been presented to the user within the duration associated with the advertising campaign, the online system 140 determines 335 an adjustment value for a bid amount associated with the identified ad request. In various embodiments, the adjustment value is determined 335 by modifying the amount of revenue previously received by the online system 140 per impression of advertisements to the user during a time interval by a value based on the frequency limit associated with the identified ad request, the amount of the duration associated with the advertising campaign that has lapsed when the opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user was identified 310, and the number of times the advertisement from the identified ad request has been presented to the user within the duration associated with the advertising campaign, the online system 140. In one embodiment, the online system 140 determines a ratio of the amount of the duration associated with the ad campaign that has lapsed to the duration associated with the ad campaign. The online system 140 determines a number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user during the amount of the duration that has lapsed by scaling the frequency limit for the ad request by the determined ratio. Based on the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user during the amount of the duration that has lapsed and the frequency limit for the ad request, the online system 140 determines 335 the adjustment value. In one embodiment, the online system 140 determines a ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user during the portion of the duration that has lapsed. If the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user during the amount of the duration that has lapsed is less than a threshold value (e.g., one), the online system 140 determines 335 the adjustment value increases the bid amount associated with the ad request based at least in part on the amount of revenue previously received by the online system 140 per impression of advertisements to the user during the time interval; conversely, if the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request during the amount of the duration that has lapsed is greater than a threshold value (e.g., one), the online system 140 determines 335 the adjustment value decreases the bid amount associated with the ad request by an amount based on the amount of revenue previously received by the online system 140 per impression of advertisements to the user during the time interval. In various embodiments, if the ratio of the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user during the amount of the duration that has lapsed equals the threshold value (e.g., one), the online system 140 determines 335 the adjustment value is zero, so the bid amount associated with the identified ad request is not modified, as further described below. Hence, if the number of impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request exceeds the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request during the amount of the duration that has lapsed, the online system 140 determines 335 an adjustment value that decreases the bid amount associated with the identified ad request. Conversely, if the number of impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request is less than the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request during the amount of the duration that has lapsed, the online system 140 determines 335 an adjustment value that increases the bid amount associated with the identified ad request. If the number of impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request equals the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the identified ad request during the amount of the duration that has lapsed, the online system 140 determines 335 no adjustment value is applied to the bid amount associated with the identified ad request. The online system 140 may differently determine 335 the adjustment value depending on whether the adjustment value increases or decreases the bid amount. For example, the online system 140 determines 335 the adjustment value as a linear function of the amount of revenue previously received by the online system 140 per impression of advertisements to the user during the time interval if the adjustment value increases the bid amount and determines 335 the adjustment value as a quadratic or a cubic function of the amount of revenue previously received by the online system 140 per impression of advertisements to the user during the time interval if the adjustment value decrease the bid amount. Hence, in the preceding example, the adjustment value decreases the bid amount associated with the ad request by a greater amount than the adjustment value increases the bid amount associated with the ad request. Alternatively, a single function of the amount of revenue previously received by the online system 140 per impression of advertisements to the user during the time interval determines 335 the adjustment value regardless of whether the adjustment value increases or decreases the bid amount. FIG. 4 shows an example of determining an adjustment value for a bid amount associated with an advertisement request (\u201cad request\u201d) associated with a frequency limit. For purposes of illustration, FIG. 4 shows a graph of ratios 410 of impressions of an advertisement from the ad request to a user to potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request during a lapsed portion of a duration of an advertising campaign including the ad request (further described above in conjunction with FIG. 3) against adjustment values 415. As shown in FIG. 4, when the ratio of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user to potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request during the lapsed portion of a duration of an advertising campaign including the ad request equals a threshold value 420, the adjustment value is zero, so the bid amount of the ad request is not modified. For example, the threshold value 420 is one, so the adjustment value is zero when the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to a user equals the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request during the lapsed portion of the duration of the advertising campaign including the ad request. When the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is less than the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request during the lapsed portion of the duration of the advertising campaign including the ad request, the ratio of the number of impression to the number of potential impressions is less than the threshold value 420, so the online system 140 determines an adjustment value 415 that increases a bid amount associated with the ad request. Increasing the bid amount by the adjustment value 415 increases a likelihood of the online system 140 selecting the ad request in a selection process, which increases a likelihood of the advertisement from the ad request being presented to the user. In the example of FIG. 4, the online system 140 determines the adjustment value 415 using a linear function 425 of an amount of revenue previously received by the online system 140 from prior impressions of advertisements to the user. As shown in FIG. 4, the adjustment value 415 decreases as a difference between the impressions of the advertisement from the ad request and the number of potential impressions of the advertisement during the lapsed portion of the duration decrease. Conversely, when the number of impressions of the advertisement from the ad request to the user is greater than the number of potential impressions of the advertisement from the ad request during the lapsed portion of the duration of the advertising campaign including the ad request, the ratio of the number of impression to the number of potential impressions is greater than the threshold value 420, so the online system 140 determines an adjustment value 415 that decreases a bid amount associated with the ad request. Decreasing the bid amount by the adjustment value 415 decreases a likelihood of the online system 140 selecting the ad request in a selection process, which slows presentation of the advertisement to the user during the duration of the advertising campaign including the ad request. The online system 140 may differently determine the adjustment value 415 when the ratio of the number of impressions to the number of potential impressions is greater than the threshold value 420 than when the ratio of the number of impression to the number of potential impressions is less than the threshold value 420. In the example of FIG. 4, the online system 140 determines the adjustment value 415 using a cubic function 430 of an amount of revenue previously received by the online system 140 from prior impressions of advertisements to the user. Using a cubic function 430 to determine the adjustment value 415 when the ratio of the number of impression to the number of potential impressions is greater than the threshold value 420 allows the online system 140 to determine adjustment values 415 that more significantly reduce the bid amount of the ad request, which more significantly decreases a likelihood of the advertisement from the ad request being presented to the user when the number of impressions of the advertisement exceeds the number of potential impressions of the advertisement. However, in other embodiments, any suitable function may be used to determine the adjustment value 415 when the ratio of the number of impression to the number of potential impressions is greater than the threshold value 420. Referring back to FIG. 3, using the determined adjustment value, the online system 140 modifies 340 the bid amount associated with the identified ad request and includes 345 the identified ad request along with the modified bid amount in one or more selection processes that select one or more advertisements for presentation to the user via the identified opportunity. In some embodiments, the online system 140 determines the bid amount associated with the identified ad request based on the budget associated with the advertising campaign and an amount of revenue received by the online system 140 from an advertiser associated with the advertising campaign during the amount of the duration that has lapsed when the opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user was identified 310. The online system 140 then modifies 340 the determined bid amount by the determined adjustment value. Determining a bid amount for an ad request based on a budget for an advertising campaign including the ad request is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/294,094, filed on Nov. 10, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In various embodiments, the online system 140 modifies 340 the bid amount associated with the identified ad request by adding the adjustment value to the bid amount associated with the identified ad request. The one or more selection processes may select one or more advertisements for presentation to the user via the identified opportunity based at least in part on the bid amounts associated with various ad requests. For example, as further described above in conjunction with FIG. 2, a selection process determines expected values for various ad requests, including the identified ad request, based on bid amounts associated with the ad requests and likelihoods of the user interacting with advertisements included in the ad requests. The selection process ranks the ad requests based on their expected values and selects ad requests having at least a threshold position in the ranking or selects ad requests having at least a threshold expected value. Advertisements from the selected ad requests are then communicated to a client device 110 associated with the user for presentation. If the identified ad request is selected and the advertisement from the identified ad request is presented to the user, the online system 140 stores information associated with the user indicating the advertisement from the identified ad request was presented to the user and a time when the advertisement from the identified ad request was presented to the user.

Many electronic communications that are sent to a user explicitly solicit that the user reply with non-textual reply content or otherwise contain information to which the user may wish to reply with non-textual reply content. For example, an email that contains \u201cCan you send me a copy of your slide deck from yesterday's meeting\u201d may explicitly solicit a reply that includes non-textual reply content (i.e., an electronic document that is the slide deck). An email that contains \u201cHow is the home remodel progressing?\u201d may not explicitly solicit a reply with non-textual reply content, but a user that receives the email may still wish to include non-textual reply content (e.g., a picture showing the current status of the home remodel) in a reply to the email. To include non-textual reply content in a reply, users must recognize that non-textual reply content is appropriate for the reply, manually browse for the non-textual reply content via a computing device of the user, and select the non-textual reply content via a user interface input device of the computing device to include the content in the reply.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>Some implementations of this specification are directed generally to methods and apparatus related to determining non-textual reply content for a reply to an electronic communication and providing the non-textual reply content for inclusion in the reply (e.g. automatically providing it in the reply or suggesting it for inclusion in the reply). Some of those implementations are directed to determining, based on an electronic communication sent to a user, one or more electronic documents that are responsive to the electronic communication, and providing one or more of those electronic documents for inclusion in a reply by the user to the electronic communication. For example, the electronic documents may be automatically attached to the reply and\/or link(s) to the electronic documents automatically provided in the reply. Also, for example, one or more user interface indications (e.g., graphical, audible) of the electronic documents may be presented and, when a user generating the reply selects one of the indications via a user interface input, the corresponding electronic document(s) may be attached to the reply and\/or link(s) to the documents automatically provided in the reply. In some implementations, the electronic document(s) may be provided for inclusion in the reply before the user has provided any textual content for the reply and\/or before the user has provided any other content for the reply. In some implementations, the electronic document(s) may be provided in response to the user selecting an \u201cattachment\u201d document interface element or in response to other user interface input indicative of a desire to include an attachment in the reply. The electronic document(s) selected for providing to a user for inclusion in a reply to an electronic communication may be identified from one or more of various corpuses such as one or more cloud-based corpuses associated with the user, local storage device(s) of a computing device being utilized by the user to generate the reply, local network storage device(s) accessible to the computing device and\/or the user, etc. In some implementations, the electronic document(s) may be located by issuing a search of one or more corpuses of documents, where the search includes one or more search parameters that are derived from the electronic communication. As one example, where a message includes \u201ccan you send me the photos from your trip to Chicago last week?\u201d, a search may be issued using an \u201cimages\u201d search parameter derived from an n-gram of the message (e.g., \u201cphotos\u201d), using a date search parameter derived from an n-gram of the message (e.g., \u201clast week\u201d), and\/or using a location search parameter derived from an n-gram of the message (e.g., \u201cChicago\u201d) to identify photos that meet the search criteria. In some implementations, the corpus(es) that are searched to identify documents to provide for inclusion in a reply may be restricted based on one or more features derived from the electronic communication. For example, in the previous example the corpuses searched may be restricted to a single corpus that includes only images and optionally other media, based on an n-gram of the message (e.g., \u201cphotos\u201d). In some implementations, which non-textual reply content is provided for inclusion in a reply to an electronic communication may be determined based on output provided by a trained machine learning system in response to providing the trained machine learning system with one or more message features of the electronic communication. For example, the trained machine learning system may provide one or more features of non-textual reply content (e.g., document type(s)) that may be used as a search parameter in a search issued to identify the non-textual reply content and\/or may be used to restrict one or more corpuses of a search issued to identify the non-textual reply content. In some implementations, whether and\/or how non-textual reply content is provided for inclusion in a reply to an electronic communication may be determined based on output provided by a trained machine learning system in response to providing the trained machine learning system with one or more message features of the electronic communication. For example, the trained machine learning system may provide a likelihood that a reply to the electronic communication will include non-textual reply content, and the likelihood may be utilized to determine whether and\/or how non-textual reply content is provided to a user for inclusion in a reply to the electronic communication. Some implementations are directed generally toward analyzing a corpus of electronic communications to determine relationships between one or more original message features of \u201coriginal\u201d messages of electronic communications and non-textual reply content that is included in \u201creply\u201d messages of those electronic communications. For example, the corpus may be analyzed to determine relationships between message features of original messages and a likelihood that replies to original messages having those message features include a document and\/or a link to a document. Also, for example, the corpus may be analyzed to determine relationships between message features of original messages and document type(s) (e.g., images, videos, media, PDF, slides) of documents that are included or linked to in replies to original messages having those message features. As one example, the corpus may be analyzed to determine that original messages that include the n-gram \u201csend me\u201d are likely to include a document and\/or a link to the document in replies to those original messages. As another example, the corpus may be analyzed to determine that original messages that include the n-gram \u201cpresentation\u201d often include files having \u201c.ppt\u201d, \u201c.cvs\u201d, or \u201c.pdf\u201d extensions in replies to those original messages. These relationships that are learned from analyzing the corpus of past electronic communications may be utilized, for example, to determine one or more search parameters for the issued search discussed above, to restrict the corpus(es) of the issued search discussed above, and\/or to determine whether and\/or how electronic documents are provided for inclusion in a reply to the message (e.g., a low likelihood that a reply will include an electronic document may lead to no documents being provided, or the document(s) being \u201csuggested\u201d in a less conspicuous manner). In some implementations, determining relationships between one or more original message features of \u201coriginal\u201d messages of electronic communications and non-textual reply content that is included in \u201creply\u201d messages of those electronic communications may be achieved via generating appropriate training examples based on a corpus of electronic communications and training a machine learning system based on those training examples. The machine learning system may be trained to receive, as input, one or more message features of an \u201coriginal message\u201d and to provide, as output, at least one feature related to non-textual reply content, such as one of the features described above. For example, in some implementations training examples may be generated that each have an output parameter indicative of type(s) of document(s) included in a reply message of a corresponding electronic communication and one or more input parameters based on the original message of the corresponding electronic communication. For instance, a first training example may include, as an output parameter, a document type of \u201cimage\u201d, and as an input parameter, all or portions of the text of the original message (and optionally annotations associated with the text) of a first electronic communication that includes an image in a reply message. A second training example may include, as an output parameter, a document type of \u201cimage\u201d, and as an input parameter, all or portions of the text of the original message (and optionally annotations associated with the text) of a second electronic communication that includes an image in a reply message. Additional training examples may be similarly generated, including additional examples with output parameter(s) based on other type(s) of documents of a reply message of a corresponding electronic communication and input parameters based on the original message of the corresponding electronic communication. The machine learning system may be trained based on the training examples. In some implementations, a method may be provided that is performed by at least one computing device and includes identifying an electronic communication sent to a user, determining a message feature of the electronic communication, and issuing a search of one or more corpuses of electronic documents using a search parameter for the search that is based on the message feature of the electronic communication. The method further includes receiving, in response to issuing the search, an indication of a subgroup of one or more of the electronic documents of the one or more corpuses that are responsive to the search. The method further includes selecting, based on receiving the indication, at least one selected electronic document of the electronic documents of the subgroup and providing at least a portion of the at least one selected electronic document for inclusion in a reply electronic communication that is a reply by the user to the electronic communication. This method and other implementations of technology disclosed herein may each optionally include one or more of the following features. In some implementations, issuing the search occurs independent of any textual input provided via a computing device of the user in generating the reply electronic communication. In some of those implementations, providing the at least a portion of the at least one selected electronic document for inclusion in the reply electronic communication occurs independent of any textual input provided via the computing device in generating the reply electronic communication. In some implementations, at least one of the one or more corpuses is not publicly accessible, but is accessible to the user. In some of those implementations, the at least one of the one or more corpuses is accessible only to the user and to one or more additional users or systems authorized by the user. In some implementations, issuing the search of the one or more corpuses includes issuing a search of one or more indexes that index the electronic documents of the one or more corpuses. In some implementations, the subgroup includes a plurality of the electronic documents and the method further includes receiving, in response to issuing the search, search rankings for the subgroup of the electronic documents of the one or more corpuses that are responsive to the search. The selecting the at least one selected electronic document of the electronic documents of the subgroup may be further based on the search rankings for the subgroup of the electronic documents. In some of those implementations, the at least one selected electronic document includes a first document and a second document and providing the at least a portion of the at least one selected electronic document for inclusion in the reply electronic communication includes: determining a prominence for providing the first document and the second document based on the search result rankings, and providing both the first document and the second document for inclusion in the reply to the electronic communication along with an indication of the prominences. In some implementations, the method further includes determining an additional message feature of the electronic communication and restricting the one or more corpuses of the search based on the additional message feature of the electronic communication. In some implementations, providing the at least a portion of the at least one selected electronic document for inclusion in the reply electronic communication includes attaching the at least a portion of the at least one selected electronic document to the reply without requiring confirmation by the user via user interface input initiated by the user. In some implementations, providing the at least a portion of the at least one selected electronic document for inclusion in the reply electronic communication comprises includes: providing a graphical indication of the at least a portion of the at least one selected electronic document; receiving a selection of the graphical indication via a user interface input device; and in response to receiving the selection, attaching the at least one selected electronic document to the reply.

In some implementations, the method further includes: determining an additional message feature of the electronic communication; providing at least the additional message feature as input to a trained machine learning system; receiving at least one document feature as output from the trained machine learning system; and using an additional search parameter for the search that is based on the at least one document feature. In some of those implementations, the at least one document feature includes a document type feature that indicates a closed class of one or more filename extensions.

In some implementations, the method further includes: determining an additional message feature of the electronic communication; providing at least the additional message feature as input to a trained machine learning system; receiving at least one document feature as output from the trained machine learning system; and restricting the one or more corpuses of the search based on the at least one document feature. In some implementations, the message feature is an embedding vector of one or more features from the electronic communication. In some implementations, the message feature is based on an n-gram in a body of the electronic communication and wherein determining the message feature based on the n-gram is based on proximity of the n-gram to a requesting verb n-gram in the body of the electronic communication. In some implementations, the method further includes labeling each of a plurality of n-grams of the electronic communication with at least one corresponding grammatical annotation. In some of those implementations, determining the message feature includes selecting an n-gram of the n-grams based on the corresponding grammatical annotation of the n-gram, and determining the message feature based on the n-gram. Other implementations may include a non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing instructions executable by a processor to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described above. Yet another implementation may include a system including memory and one or more processors operable to execute instructions, stored in the memory, to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described above.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 illustrates an example environment in which non-textual reply content to include in a reply to an electronic communication may be determined based on one or more message features of the electronic communication. The example environment includes a communication network 101 that facilitates communication between the various components in the environment. In some implementations, the communication network 101 may include the Internet, one or more intranets, and\/or one or more bus subsystems. The communication network 101 may optionally utilize one or more standard communications technologies, protocols, and\/or inter-process communication techniques. The example environment also includes a client device 106, an electronic communications system 110, non-textual reply content system 120, at least one trained machine learning system 135, electronic document corpuses 154A-N, and at least one electronic communications database 152. Electronic communications system 110, non-textual reply content system 120, and trained machine learning system 135 may each be implemented in one or more computing devices that communicate, for example, through a network (e.g., network 101 and\/or other network). Electronic communications system 110, non-textual reply content system 120, and trained machine learning system 135 are example systems in which the systems, components, and techniques described herein may be implemented and\/or with which systems, components, and techniques described herein may interface. Electronic communications system 110, non-textual reply content system 120, and trained machine learning system 135 each include one or more memories for storage of data and software applications, one or more processors for accessing data and executing applications, and other components that facilitate communication over a network. In some implementations, electronic communications system 110, non-textual reply content system 120, and trained machine learning system 135 may include one or more components of the example computing device of FIG. 8. The operations performed by electronic communications system 110, non-textual reply content system 120, and trained machine learning system 135 may be distributed across multiple computer systems. In some implementations, one or more aspects of electronic communications system 110, non-textual reply content system 120, and\/or trained machine learning system 135 may be combined in a single system and\/or one or more aspects may be implemented on the client device 106. Generally, in some implementations non-textual reply content system 120 determines and provides non-textual reply content to include in a reply to an electronic communication, such as an electronic communication provided by client device 106 and\/or an electronic communication of electronic communications database 152 to which a user has yet to reply. The non-textual reply content system 120 may determine the non-textual reply content based on one or more message features of the electronic communication. In some implementations, the non-textual reply content system 120 may provide the determined non-textual reply content for inclusion in a reply to a communication independent of any textual input provided by the user in generating the reply to the communication and\/or independent any other content provided by the user in generating the reply to the communication. In some implementations, the non-textual reply content determined and provided by non-textual reply content system 120 includes all or portions of one or more electronic documents that are responsive to the electronic communication, such as one or more electronic images, videos, word processing documents, spreadsheets, slide decks, structured data that includes a user's travel plans, other electronic communications, etc. The electronic document(s) determined and provided for an electronic communication are document(s) that are separate from and in addition to the electronic communication itself, and separate from and in addition to the reply to the electronic communication. The electronic documents may be selected from one or more electronic document corpuses 154A-N provided on one or more storage mediums. In some implementations, the one or more electronic document corpuses 154A-N from which an electronic document is selected for inclusion in a reply of a user may include, or be restricted to, one or more corpuses that are not publicly accessible, but that are accessible to the user. For example, one or more of the electronic document corpuses 154A-N may be accessible only to the user and one or more systems and\/or other users authorized by the user. For instance, one or more of the electronic document corpuses 154A-N may be one or more cloud-based corpuses accessible to the user, local storage device(s) of a computing device (e.g., client device 106) of the user that is being utilized to generate the reply, local network storage device(s) accessible to the computing device and\/or the user, etc. As described herein, in some implementations the non-textual reply content system 120 may select the electronic document(s) for inclusion in a reply from a group of electronic documents received in response to issuing a search of one or more of the electronic document corpuses 154A-N, where the search includes one or more search parameters that are derived from an electronic communication to which the reply is responsive. The electronic communications database 152 includes one or more storage mediums that include all, or portions of, electronic communications of a plurality of users. In some implementations, the electronic communications database 152 is maintained by the electronic communications system 110. For example, the electronic communications system 110 may include one or more email systems and the electronic communications database 152 may include a plurality of emails that are sent and\/or received via the email systems. As another example, the electronic communications system 110 may include one or more social networking systems and the electronic communications database 152 may include a plurality of messages, posts, or other communications that are sent and\/or received via the social networking systems. As used herein, an \u201celectronic communication\u201d or \u201ccommunication\u201d may refer to an email, a text message (e.g., SMS, MMS), an instant message, a transcribed voicemail, or any other electronic communication that is sent from a first user to a restricted group of one or more additional users. In various implementations, an electronic communication may include various metadata and the metadata may optionally be utilized in one or more techniques described herein. For example, an electronic communication such as an email may include an electronic communication address such as one or more sender identifiers (e.g., sender email addresses), one or more recipient identifiers (e.g., recipient email addresses, including cc'd and bcc'd recipients), a date sent, one or more attachments, a subject, a type of device that sent and\/or received the electronic communication, and so forth. As used herein, \u201celectronic communication\u201d and \u201ccommunication\u201d will be utilized, depending on the context, to refer to both an electronic communication that includes only an original message and an electronic communication that includes one or more original messages and includes one or more reply messages. An electronic communication may be a single document such as an email that includes both an original message and a reply message and that can be processed to distinguish the original message and the reply message. Processing an electronic communication to distinguish an original message and a reply message may include \u201csplitting\u201d the message based on presence of metadata, message breaks, header information included in the message, quotes provided around the original message, etc. An electronic communication may also be multiple documents that are mapped to one another based on at least one of the multiple documents being responsive to other of the multiple documents. For example, an electronic communication may include a first email that is an original message received by a user and a second email sent by the user as a reply to that original message, or original and reply SMS messages. The mapping of multiple documents to one another may be performed, for example, by the electronic communications system 110. For example, the electronic communications system 110 may map a first email to a second email based on a user selecting a \u201creply\u201d user interface element when viewing the first email and then drafting the second email responsive to selecting the reply user interface element. As used herein, an original message is earlier in time to a responsive reply message, but is not necessarily the first message in an electronic communication. For example, an original message may be the first in time message in an electronic communication and a reply message that is responsive to that original message may be a later in time (e.g., the next in time) message. Also, for example, an original message may additionally and\/or alternatively be the second, third, or fourth in time message in an electronic communication and a reply message that is responsive to that original message may be a later in time message in the electronic communication. Each of an original message and a reply message may include one or more of associated text, metadata, and\/or other content (e.g., attached document(s), link(s) to document(s)). In various implementations, non-textual reply content system 120 may include a message features engine 122, a search parameters engine 124, a search engine 126, and\/or a presentation engine 128. In some implementations, all or aspects of engines 122, 124, 126, and\/or 128 may be omitted. In some implementations, all or aspects of engines 122, 124, 126, and\/or 128 may be combined. In some implementations, all or aspects of engines 122, 124, 126, and\/or 128 may be implemented in a component that is separate from non-textual reply content system 120, such as client device 106 and\/or electronic communications system 110. Description of the engines 122, 124, 126, and 128 is provided below with reference to an electronic communication of a user, such as an electronic communication provided by client device 106 and\/or an electronic communication of electronic communications database 152 to which the user has yet to reply. Although a single electronic communication is referenced in the examples for clarity, it is understood that the non-textual reply content system 120 may determine reply content for additional electronic communications of the user and\/or of additional users. The message features engine 122 determines one or more original message features based on an electronic communication sent to a user (i.e., based at least in part on the content of the electronic communication as that content was sent to the user). Various original message features may be utilized. For example, message features engine 122 may determine one or more n-grams in the electronic communication as message features. For instance, one or more of the n-grams may be determined based on term frequency of the n-gram in the electronic communication (i.e., how often the n-gram occurs in the electronic communication) and\/or inverse document frequency of the n-gram in a collection of documents (i.e., how often the n-gram occurs in a collection of documents, such as a collection of electronic communications). Also, for instance, one or more of the n-grams may be determined based on positional proximity of the n-gram to one or more other n-grams, such as a requesting verb n-gram (e.g., \u201csend\u201d, \u201cprovide\u201d, \u201cattach\u201d). As yet another instance, one or more of the n-grams may be determined based on a part of speech of the n-gram (e.g., \u201cnoun\u201d) or based on the n-gram being included in a listing of potentially relevant n-grams and\/or not being included in a listing of irrelevant n-grams (e.g., stop words such as \u201can\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d). Also, for example, message features engine 122 may determine co-occurrence of two or more n-grams in the electronic communication as a message feature, such as co-occurrence in a particular order (e.g., a first n-gram before a second n-gram), in a certain positional relationship (e.g., within n terms or characters of one another), etc. Also, for example, message features engine 122 may determine one or more message features based on one or more natural language processing tags or other labels applied to text of the electronic communication (e.g., parts of speech, named entities, entity types, tone); features based on text that occurs specifically in the subjects, the first sentences, the last sentences, or other portion of the electronic communication; features based on metadata of the electronic communication such as a time the electronic communication was sent, day of the week the electronic communication was sent, a number of recipients, a type of device that sent the electronic communication, etc. Also, for example, message features engine 122 may determine an embedding vector of one or more features from the entire electronic communication or a subset of the electronic communication (e.g., one or more paragraphs, one or more sentences, one or more words). The features of the embedding vector may include one or more n-grams, labels applied to one or more n-grams, syntactic features, semantic features, metadata features, and\/or other features. As one specific example, assume the electronic communication includes a subject with the text \u201cspreadsheet\u201d and a body with the text \u201cPlease send me yesterday's sales spreadsheet. Thanks.\u201d The message features engine 122 may determine message features that include the n-grams \u201csend\u201d, \u201cyesterday\u201d, \u201csales\u201d, and \u201cspreadsheet\u201d, while excluding other n-grams such as \u201cPlease\u201d and \u201cthanks.\u201d For example, the message features engine 122 may determine \u201csend\u201d as a message feature based on it being a requesting verb n-gram, may determine \u201cyesterday\u201d as a message feature based on it being a temporal indicator and\/or based on it being in close positional proximity to \u201csend\u201d, may determine \u201csales\u201d as an n-gram based on it being a noun in the text and\/or based on it being in close positional proximity to \u201csend\u201d, and may determine \u201cspreadsheet\u201d as an n-gram based on it being a noun, based on it being in close positional proximity to \u201csend\u201d, and\/or based on it being in a listing of potentially relevant terms. The message features engine 122 provides determined message features to search parameters engine 124 and optionally to trained machine learning system 135. The message features engine 122 may provide the same message features to search parameters engine 124 and to trained machine learning system 135, or the provided message features may differ. The search parameters engine 124 generates one or more search parameters based on one or more of the message features provided by message features engine 122. As one example of generating search parameters based on one or more of the message features provided by message features engine 122, assume the message features engine 122 provides a group of message features that include the n-grams \u201csend\u201d, \u201cyesterday\u201d, \u201csales\u201d, and \u201cspreadsheet\u201d. The search parameters engine 124 may generate a date search parameter based on \u201cyesterday.\u201d For example, the date search parameter may specify a date of creation and\/or most recent modification for a document and may be \u201cyesterday\u201d or may be one or more particular dates specified based on \u201cyesterday\u201d. The search parameters engine 124 may also generate additional search parameters of \u201csales\u201d and \u201cspreadsheet\u201d. The \u201csales\u201d search parameter may be a general textual parameter. The \u201cspreadsheet\u201d search parameter may be a general textual parameter and\/or a document type search parameter that biases those type(s) of documents in a search, restricts a search to one or more types of documents (e.g., those having a \u201c.pdf\u201d, \u201c.xls\u201d, \u201c.ods\u201d, \u201c.csv\u201d, and\/or \u201c.tsv\u201d filename extension), and\/or restricts a search to one or more corpuses that include (and are optionally restricted to) documents of the type of documents. As another example of generating search parameters based on one or more of the message features provided by message features engine 122, assume the message features engine 122 provides an embedding vector of one or more features from the entire electronic communication or a subset of the electronic communication. The search parameters engine 124 may generate search parameters based on a decoded version of the embedding vector. The search parameters engine 124 may also optionally generate one or more search parameters based on output provided by the at least one trained machine learning system 135 to the search parameters engine 124. For example, as described herein (see e.g., FIGS. 5-7), the trained machine learning system 135 may be trained to receive, as input, one or more message features and to provide, as output, one or more features of non-textual reply content, such as one or more document types of non-textual reply content. The search parameters engine 124 may utilize one or more of the features of the output to generate a search parameter. For example, where the trained machine learning system 135 provides output of document type(s) of non-textual reply content based on input of message features for an electronic communication, the document type(s) may be used as a search parameter that biases those type(s) of documents, that restricts the search to those type(s) of documents, and\/or restricts the search to one or more corpuses that include (and are optionally restricted to) documents of those type(s). In some implementations, the search parameters engine 124 may determine whether to generate search parameters for the electronic communication based on output provided by the at least one trained machine learning system 135 to the search parameters engine 124. For example, as described herein (see e.g., FIGS. 5-7), the at least one trained machine learning system 135 may be trained to receive, as input, one or more message features and to provide, as output, a likelihood that a reply to the electronic communication will include non-textual reply content. The search parameters engine 124 may utilize the likelihood in determining whether to generate search parameters. For example, the search parameters engine 124 may generate search parameters only if the likelihood satisfies a threshold. The search engine 126 searches one or more of the electronic document corpuses 154A-N based on the search parameters determined by search parameters engine 124. In some implementations, searching one or more of the electronic document corpuses 154A-N may include searching one or more indexes that index the electronic documents of one or more of the document corpuses. The search engine 126 may issue one or more searches based on the search parameters, that each combine the search parameters in one or more manners. For example, the search engine 126 may issue one or more searches to identify documents that satisfy each of a group of one or more (e.g., all) of the search parameters (e.g., a search that combines multiple search parameters with \u201cAND\u201d). Also, for example, the search engine 126 may issue one or more searches to identify documents that satisfy only some of the search parameters (e.g., a search that combines multiple search parameters with \u201cOR\u201d). In some implementations, the search engine 126 may identify a portion of a document in response to a search. For example, the search engine 126 may identify one or more paragraphs of a multi paragraph document, one or more slides of a slide deck, one or more sentences of a document with multiple sentences, etc. In some implementations, the search engine 126 may identify multiple documents in response to a search based on one or more search parameters derived from an electronic communication. In some of those implementations, the multiple documents may each be ranked based on various criteria such as a query based score (e.g., based on how closely a document matches the query) and\/or a document based score. A query based score of a document is based on a relationship between the query and the document, such as how closely the document matches the query. For example, a first document that includes each word of a query may have a \u201chigher\u201d query based score than a second document that only includes some of the words of the query. Also, for example, a first document that includes all words of the query in a title and\/or other prominent position may have a \u201chigher\u201d query based score than a second document that only includes words of the query in the last portion of a body of the second document. A document based score of a document is based on one or more properties of the document that are independent of the query. For example, the document based score of a document may be based on popularity of the document for the user (e.g., frequency of access by the user), based on a date the user and\/or other user last accessed the document, based on a date the document was created, etc. The search engine 126 provides, to the presentation engine 128, indications (e.g., document identifiers) of one or more of the electronic documents that are responsive to the search, and optionally the ranking of the electronic documents. The presentation engine 128 selects one or more of the electronic documents and provides the selected electronic documents for inclusion in a reply electronic communication that is a reply by the user to the electronic communication. Providing an electronic document for inclusion in a reply may include, for example, providing the actual document (e.g., embedding or otherwise attaching the document), providing a link to the document, providing a user interface indication of the document that is associated with the document, etc. For example, the presentation engine 128 may automatically attach a selected electronic document to the reply and\/or automatically incorporate link(s) to the electronic documents in the reply. Also, for example, the presentation engine 128 may present one or more user interface indications (e.g., graphical, audible) of the electronic documents and, when a user generating the reply selects one of the indications, the corresponding electronic document(s) may be attached to the reply and\/or link(s) to the documents automatically provided in the reply. In some implementations, the electronic document(s) may be provided for inclusion in a reply in response to the user selecting an \u201cattachment\u201d document interface element or in response to other user interface input indicative of a desire to include an attachment in the reply. In some implementations, the presentation engine 128 selects the electronic documents and\/or provides the electronic documents independent of any textual input and\/or other content provided via a computing device of the user in generating a reply to the electronic communication. In some of those implementations, the presentation engine 128 selects the electronic documents before the user has even viewed or otherwise consumed the communication. For example, the non-textual reply content system 120 may process a communication in advance of viewing by the user, presentation engine 128 may select one or more electronic documents for inclusion in a reply to the communication, and append or otherwise associate the selected electronic documents with the electronic communication before it is even viewed by the user. In some implementations, the presentation engine 128 selects and\/or provides the electronic documents for inclusion in the reply based on the optional ranking provided by the search engine 126. For example, in some implementations the presentation engine 128 may only select an electronic document when its associated ranking satisfies a threshold (e.g., if it is one of the X highest ranked electronic documents). Also, for example, the prominence with which a selected electronic document is provided and\/or how the selected electronic document is provided may be based on the ranking of the selected electronic document. In some implementations, the presentation engine 128 may select and provide multiple electronic documents for inclusion in a reply. In some of those implementations, the multiple electronic documents may be provided based on the optional ranking of the electronic documents. For example, a presentation prominence for each of the multiple electronic documents may be determined based on the ranking and the multiple documents provided for potential inclusion in the reply to the electronic communication, along with an indication of the presentation prominences. In some implementations where the electronic communication is provided to the non-textual reply content system 120 by the client device 106, the presentation engine 128 may provide the selected electronic documents to the client device 106 for presentation to the user as an option for including in a reply. In some implementations where the electronic communication is provided to the non-textual reply content system 120 by the electronic communications system 110 via the electronic communications database 152, the presentation engine 128 may store an association of the selected electronic documents with the electronic communication in the electronic communications database 152 and\/or other database. In some implementations, one or more (e.g., all) aspects of the presentation engine 128 may be implemented by the client device 106 and\/or the electronic communications system 110. The presentation engine 128 may also provide display prominence information with the selected electronic documents that indicates the prominence (e.g., position, size, color) with which the selected electronic documents should be presented. Generally, a higher ranking for a particular selected electronic document, the greater the prominence for that electronic document. As one example, where multiple electronic documents are selected by the presentation engine 128, the presentation engine 128 may provide an indication of the ranking of those multiple electronic documents for use in determining in which order the multiple candidates should be presented to a user via a user interface output device of the client device 106. In some implementations, the presentation engine 128 provides only document identifier(s) of selected documents, and potentially prominence information, and the client device 106 and\/or electronic communications system 110 may generate a display of the selected documents based on the provided data. In some implementations, the presentation engine 128 may additionally provide some or all of the data necessary to generate the display. In some of those implementations, any provided prominence information may be incorporated in the data that indicates how the display should be presented. In some implementations, the presentation engine 128 may determine whether and\/or how to provide to provide electronic document(s) for inclusion in a reply based on output provided by the at least one trained machine learning system 135 in response to original message features provided to the trained machine learning system 135 by message features engine 122. For example, as described herein, the at least one trained machine learning system 135 may be trained to receive, as input, one or more message features and to provide, as output, a likelihood that a reply to the electronic communication will include non-textual reply content. In some implementations, the presentation engine 128 may utilize the likelihood in determining whether to provide to provide electronic document(s) for inclusion in a reply. For example, the presentation engine 128 may provide electronic document(s) for inclusion in a reply only if the likelihood satisfies a threshold. In some implementations, the presentation engine 128 may utilize the likelihood in determining how to provide electronic document(s) for inclusion in a reply. For example, the presentation engine 128 may automatically include the electronic documents in a reply if the likelihood satisfies a threshold, but may require user interface input before including them in the reply if the likelihood does not satisfy the threshold. Also, for example, the presentation engine 128 may: if the likelihood is greater than or equal to X (e.g., X=0.8), provide the electronic documents for inclusion in a reply before any user interface input has been provided indicating a desire to reply (e.g., FIG. 4A); may, if the likelihood is less than X and greater than or equal to Y (e.g., Y=0.5), require user interface input indicating a desire to reply (e.g., FIG. 4B) before providing the electronic document; and may, if the likelihood is less than Y, require user interface input indicating a desire to attach a document (e.g., FIGS. 4D1 and 4D2) before providing the electronic document. FIG. 2 illustrates an example of how non-textual reply content to include in a reply to an electronic communication may be determined based on one or more message features of the communication. Message features engine 122 determines one or more message features of an electronic communication 152A sent to a user. Electronic communication 152A may be provided by, for example, client device 106 or electronic communications system 110 of FIG. 1. The message features engine 122 provides one or more of the determined message features to search parameters engine 124 and provides one or more of the determined message features to the at least one trained machine learning system 135. The message features provided by the message features engine 122 to the search parameters engine 124 and to the machine learning systems 135 may be the same, or may differ. The trained machine learning system 135 provides, based on the received message features, one or more document features to the search parameters engine 124. The one or more document features may be, for example, one or more document types of non-textual reply content. The search parameters engine 124 may utilize one or more of the document features to generate a search parameter. For example, where one of the trained machine learning systems 135 provides output of document type(s) of non-textual reply content based on input of message features for an electronic communication, the document type(s) may be used as a search parameter that biases those type(s) of documents, that restricts the search to those type(s) of documents, and\/or restricts the search to one or more corpuses that include (and are optionally restricted to) documents of those type(s). The search parameters engine 124 also generates one or more search parameters based on the message features received from the message features engine 122. The search parameters engine 124 provides the search parameters to the search engine 126. The search engine 126 searches one or more of the electronic document corpuses 154A-N based on the search parameters determined by search parameters engine 124. In some implementations, searching one or more of the electronic document corpuses 154A-N may include searching one or more indexes that index the electronic documents of one or more of the document corpuses. The search engine 126 may issue one or more searches based on the search parameters, that each combine the search parameters in one or more manners. In some implementations, the search engine 126 may identify multiple documents in response to a search based on one or more search parameters derived from an electronic communication. In some of those implementations, the multiple documents may each be ranked based on various criteria such as a query based and\/or a document based score. The search engine 126 provides, to the presentation engine 128, document identifiers of one or more of the electronic documents that are responsive to the search, and also provides the optional ranking of the electronic documents. The presentation engine 128 selects one or more of the electronic documents and provides the selected electronic documents 159 for inclusion in a reply electronic communication that is a reply by the user to the electronic communication. Providing an electronic document for inclusion in a reply may include, for example, providing the actual document, providing a link to the document, providing a user interface indication of the document that is associated with the document, etc. FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating an example method of determining non-textual reply content to include in a reply to an electronic communication based on one or more message features of the communication. For convenience, the operations of the flow chart are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems. For instance, some operations may be performed by one or more components of the non-textual reply content system 120, such as engines 122, 124, 126, and\/or 128. Moreover, while operations of the method of FIG. 3 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added. At block 300, the system identifies an electronic communication sent to a user. At block 302, the system determines one or more message features of the electronic communication. Various original message features may be utilized such as textual, semantic, and\/or syntactic features. For example, the system may determine message features based on more n-grams in the electronic communication, co-occurrence of two or more n-grams in the electronic communication, features based on text that occurs specifically in the subjects, the first sentences, the last sentences, or other portion of the electronic communication, features based on metadata of the electronic communication, etc. At block 304, the system issues a search of one or more corpuses of electronic documents using search parameters that are based on one or more of the message features of block 302. For example, the system may use the message features as the search parameters and\/or derive the search parameters from the message features. In some implementations, the system may provide one or more of the message features as input to a trained machine learning system and utilize output of the trained machine learning system as one or more of the search parameters and\/or to derive one or more of the search parameters. At block 306, the system receives an indication of a subgroup of electronic documents. The subgroup is a subgroup of the corpuses and represents electronic documents that are responsive to the search of block 304. In some implementations, the system also receives a ranking of the subgroup. At block 308, the system selects at least one electronic document of the subgroup. For example, the system may select the at least one electronic document based on the optional ranking of block 306. At block 310, the system provides the at least one electronic document for inclusion in a reply electronic communication that is a reply by the user to the electronic communication. Providing an electronic document for inclusion in a reply may include, for example, providing the actual document (e.g., embedding or otherwise attaching the document), providing a link to the document, providing a user interface indication of the document that is associated with the document, etc. FIGS. 4A-4E illustrate example graphical user interfaces for providing non-textual reply content for inclusion in a reply to an electronic communication. The graphical user interfaces of FIGS. 4A-4E may be presented at client device 106 based on non-textual reply content that is determined and provided by non-textual reply content system 120. In some implementations, one or more aspects of non-textual reply content system 120 (e.g., all or aspects of presentation engine 128) may be incorporated, in whole or in part, on client device 106. In FIG. 4A, an original email 475A that has been sent to a user is being viewed by the user, before the user has provided any user interface input to indicate a desire to reply to the original email 475A. The candidate electronic documents represented by graphical user interface elements 481A and 482A are determined based on the original email 475A and are presented for inclusion in a reply to the email. For example, a user selection of graphical user interface element 481A may automatically present an editable reply email to the user that includes the electronic document \u201cPatent Presentation.pdf\u201d attached to the reply, or a link to that electronic document incorporated in the reply (e.g., a hyperlink incorporated in the body of the reply). Likewise, a user selection of graphical user interface element 482A may automatically present an editable reply email to the user that includes the electronic document \u201cBudget Presentation.pdf\u201d attached to the reply, or a link to that electronic document incorporated in the reply (e.g., a hyperlink incorporated in the body of the reply). In some implementations, both graphical user interface elements 481A and 482A may be selected to include both associated electronic documents in the reply. Graphical user interface elements 481A and 482A both include a title of the associated electronic document (presented in bold and underlined), along with associated additional information to facilitate user recollection of the associated electronic document. In particular, graphical user interface elements 481A and 482A each includes additional information indicating a temporal indication of when the document was last accessed by the user, a temporal indication of when the document was last modified, a corpus (\u201ccloud\u201d) and corpus folder (\u201cpresentations\u201d) location of the document, and a creator indicating a user that created the document. Additional and\/or alternative additional information may be provided such as a snippet of text from the document (e.g., the first X words of the document), an image of all or portions of the document, etc. In some implementations, the presentation position of graphical user interface elements 481A and 482A may be based on determined display prominences that are based on rankings of the documents associated with those graphical user interface elements 481A and 482A. For example, graphical user interface element 481A may be presented positionally higher up than graphical user interface element 482A based on the document associated with graphical user interface element 481A being ranked higher than the document associated with graphical user interface element 482A. As described herein, the rankings of the documents may be rankings from a search issued with search parameters based on one or more message features of the original email 475A. Additional and\/or alternative presentations based on rankings of the documents associated with the graphical user interface elements 481A and 482A may be provided. For example, graphical user interface element 481A may be highlighted and\/or presented with more additional information than graphical user interface element 482A. FIG. 4A also includes a selectable graphical user interface element 483A that, when selected by the user, displays additional documents. The additional documents may be documents identified based on the original email (e.g., based on issuing a search with search parameters based on one or more message features of the original email), but having a lower ranking than the documents associated with graphical user interface elements 481A and 482A. In FIG. 4B, a user has provided user interface input (e.g., selecting a \u201creply\u201d graphical user interface element) to initiate a reply to an original email and is presented with a reply section 480B that includes phantom text \u201cCompose email\u201d indicating to the user that the user can compose a reply in the reply section 480B. The original email 475B to which the reply is responsive is also illustrated in FIG. 4B for reference of the user in generating the reply. Graphical user interface elements 481B and 482B are presented in FIG. 4B for inclusion in the reply of associated candidate electronic documents determined based on the original email 475B. The graphical user interface elements 481B and 482B are presented before the user has provided any textual input or other content for the reply. User selection of graphical user interface element 481B may attach the electronic document \u201cPatent Presentation.pdf\u201d to the reply or incorporate a link to that electronic document in the reply (e.g., a hyperlink incorporated in the reply section 480B). Likewise, a user selection of graphical user interface element 482B may attach the electronic document \u201cBudget Presentation.pdf\u201d to the reply or incorporate a link to that electronic document in the reply. In some implementations, both graphical user interface elements 481B and 482B may be selected to include both associated electronic documents in the reply. Graphical user interface elements 481B and 482B both include a title of the associated electronic document (presented in bold and underlined), along with associated additional information to facilitate user recollection of the associated electronic document. In some implementations, the presentation position of graphical user interface elements 481B and 482B may be based on determined display prominences that are based on rankings of the documents associated with those graphical user interface elements 481B and 482B. For example, graphical user interface element 481B may be presented positionally to the left of graphical user interface element 482B based on the document associated with graphical user interface element 481B being ranked higher than the document associated with graphical user interface element 482B. As described herein, the rankings of the documents may be rankings from a search issued with search parameters based on one or more message features of the original email. In FIG. 4C, a user has provided user interface input (e.g., selecting a \u201creply\u201d graphical user interface element) to initiate a reply to an original email and is presented with a reply section 480C that includes phantom text \u201cCompose email\u201d indicating to the user that the user can compose a reply in the reply section 480C. The original email 475C to which the reply is responsive is also illustrated in FIG. 4C for reference of the user in generating the reply. Graphical user interface element 481C is presented and is associated with multiple candidate electronic documents determined based on the original email 475C. For example, graphical user interface element 481C may be associated with all electronic presentations of the user composing the reply. The electronic presentations may have been identified based on issuing a search of the user's documents using a \u201cpresentation\u201d search parameter that is based on the original email 475C. User selection of graphical user interface element 481C may present the user with graphical indications of the electronic presentations of the user, one or more of which may be selected to attach the selected electronic presentation(s) to the reply or incorporate link(s) to the electronic presentation(s) in the reply (e.g., a hyperlink incorporated in the reply section 480C). Graphical user interface element 482C is associated with all of the user's electronic documents. User selection of graphical user interface element 482C may present the user with graphical indications of all of the electronic documents of the user. The user may browse all of the electronic documents and select one or more to attach to the reply or incorporate link(s) to the electronic document(s) in the reply (e.g., a hyperlink incorporated in the reply section 480C). Graphical user interface elements 481C and 482C are presented in FIG. 4C before the user has provided any textual input or other content for the reply. In FIG. 4D1, a user has provided user interface input (e.g., selecting a \u201creply\u201d graphical user interface element) to initiate a reply to an original email and is presented with a reply section 480D that includes phantom text \u201cCompose email\u201d indicating to the user that the user can compose a reply in the reply section 480D. The original email 475D to which the reply is responsive is also illustrated in FIG. 4D1 for reference of the user in generating the reply. In FIG. 4D1, an attachment graphical user interface element 477D is also presented. In response to user interface input that selects the attachment graphical user interface element 477D, the attachments graphical user interface of FIG. 4D2 is presented. The attachments graphical user interface of FIG. 4D2 includes graphical user interface elements 481D and 482D for inclusion in the reply of associated candidate electronic documents determined based on the original email 475D. The graphical user interface elements 481D and 482D are presented in response to the selection of attachment graphical user interface element 477D and are presented before the user has provided any textual input or other content for the reply. User selection of graphical user interface element 481D may attach the electronic document \u201cPatent Presentation.pdf\u201d to the reply or incorporate a link to that electronic document in the reply (e.g., a hyperlink incorporated in the reply section 480D). Likewise, a user selection of graphical user interface element 482D may attach the electronic document \u201cBudget Presentation.pdf\u201d to the reply or incorporate a link to that electronic document in the reply. In some implementations, both graphical user interface elements 481D and 482D may be selected to include both associated electronic documents in the reply. Graphical user interface elements 481D and 482D both include a title of the associated electronic document (presented in bold and underlined), along with associated additional information to facilitate user recollection of the associated electronic document. In some implementations, the presentation position of graphical user interface elements 481D and 482D may be based on determined display prominences that are based on rankings of the documents associated with those graphical user interface elements 481D and 482D. For example, graphical user interface element 481D may be presented positionally to the left of graphical user interface element 482D based on the document associated with graphical user interface element 481D being ranked higher than the document associated with graphical user interface element 482D. As described herein, the rankings of the documents may be rankings from a search issued with search parameters based on one or more message features of the original email. The attachments graphical user interface of FIG. 4D2 also includes graphical user interface element 483D that, when selected via user interface input provided by the user, displays additional documents determined based on the original email 475D (e.g., based on issuing a search with search parameters based on one or more message features of the original email), but having a lower ranking than the documents associated with graphical user interface elements 481D and 482D. The attachments graphical user interface of FIG. 4D2 also includes graphical user interface element 484D that, when selected via user interface input provided by the user, enables the user to browser all of the user's electronic documents and select one or more to attach to the reply or incorporate link(s) to the electronic document(s) in the reply. In FIG. 4E, a user has provided user interface input (e.g., selecting a \u201creply\u201d graphical user interface element) to initiate a reply to an original text message and is presented with a reply section 480E that includes phantom text \u201cReply\u201d indicating to the user that the user can compose a reply in the reply section 480E. The original text message 475E to which the reply is responsive is also illustrated in FIG. 4E for reference of the user in generating the reply. Graphical user interface element 481E is presented and is associated with a first set of multiple candidate electronic documents determined based on the original email 475E. In particular, graphical user interface element 481E is associated with all pictures of the user composing the reply that were taken \u201clast week\u201d in \u201cChicago\u201d and may be identified based on issuing a search of the user's documents using \u201cimages\u201d, \u201cChicago\u201d, and \u201clast week\u201d search parameters that are based on the original text message 475E. User selection of graphical user interface element 481E may attach those pictures to the reply or incorporate link(s) to the pictures in the reply (e.g., a hyperlink incorporated in the reply section 480E). Graphical user interface element 482E is presented and is associated with a second set of multiple candidate electronic documents determined based on the original text message 475E. In particular, graphical user interface element 482E is associated with all pictures of the user composing the reply that were taken \u201clast week\u201d in \u201cChicago\u201d that include \u201cTom\u201d in the picture and may be identified based on issuing a search of the user's documents using \u201cimages\u201d, \u201cChicago\u201d, \u201clast week\u201d, and \u201cTom\u201d (e.g., a user identifier associated with Tom) search parameters that are based on the original text message 475E. User selection of graphical user interface element 482E may attach those pictures to the reply or incorporate link(s) to the pictures in the reply (e.g., a hyperlink incorporated in the reply section 480E). Graphical user interface element 483E is also presented and is associated with the same first set of pictures as graphical user interface element 481E. However, user selection of graphical user interface element 483E may present the user with graphical indications of the pictures, one or more of which may be selected to attach the selected picture(s) to the reply or incorporate link(s) to the picture(s) in the reply (e.g., a hyperlink incorporated in the reply section 480E). Turning now to FIGS. 5-7, additional description is provided of training the at least one trained machine learning system 135 of FIGS. 1 and 2 that may be utilized, for example, in various apparatus and methods described with respect to FIGS. 1-4. FIG. 5 illustrates an example environment in which electronic communications may be analyzed to generate training examples for training a machine learning system to determine one or more non-textual reply content features and in which the machine learning system may be trained based on the training examples. The example environment of FIG. 5 includes the electronic communications system 110, the electronic communications database 152, and a machine learning system 135A that represents the at least one trained machine learning system 135 of FIG. 1 in its untrained state. The example environment of FIG. 5 also includes a selection engine 130 and a training examples system 140. Selection engine 130, training examples system 140, and machine learning system 135A may each be implemented in one or more computing devices that communicate, for example, through a network. Selection engine 130, training examples system 140, and machine learning system 135A are example systems in which the systems, components, and techniques described herein may be implemented and\/or with which systems, components, and techniques described herein may interface. Selection engine 130, training examples system 140, and machine learning system 135A each include one or more memories for storage of data and software applications, one or more processors for accessing data and executing applications, and other components that facilitate communication over a network. In some implementations, selection engine 130 and training examples system 140 may include one or more components of the example computing device of FIG. 8. The operations performed by selection engine 130, training examples system 140, and\/or machine learning system 135A may be distributed across multiple computer systems. In some implementations, one or more aspects of selection engine 130, training examples system 140, and\/or machine learning system 135A may be combined in a single system. Generally, in some implementations training examples system 140 utilizes, without direct human access, past electronic communications of electronic communications database 152 to generate training examples for training the machine learning system 135A. The training examples may be generated to train the machine learning system 135A to learn relationships between one or more message features of \u201coriginal\u201d messages and one or more features related to attachments in \u201creplies\u201d to those original messages. For example, in some implementations the machine learning system 135A may be trained to determine relationships between message features of original messages and a likelihood that replies to electronic communications having those message features include a document and\/or a link to a document. Also, for example, in some other implementations, the machine learning system 135A may be trained to determine relationships between message features of original messages and document type(s) (e.g., images, videos, media, PDF, slides) of documents that will included or linked to in replies to electronic communications having those message features. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 may select, based on one or more criteria, communications that are utilized by the training example system 140 to generate training examples for training each of one or more machine learning system 135. For example, the selection engine 130 may flag or otherwise annotate certain communications of the electronic communications database 152 as those that are appropriate for utilization by the training example system 140. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 may select the electronic communications that are utilized based on those electronic communications including an \u201coriginal\u201d message and a \u201creply\u201d message that is responsive to the original message. As described herein, an electronic communication that includes an original message and a reply message may be a single document and\/or multiple documents that are mapped to one another. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 may select the electronic communications that are utilized for training examples for training of the machine learning system 135A based on those electronic communications including a reply with non-textual reply content, such as an attached document and\/or a link to a document. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 may employ one or more techniques to reduce the occurrence of certain types of communications that are utilized in generating training examples. For example, where the database 152 includes emails, the selection engine 130 may employ techniques to filter out emails that are likely from businesses. For instance, emails from certain e-mail addresses, emails from email addresses with certain domain names, emails from email addresses with certain prefixes, emails with certain n-grams in a subject line, etc. may be filtered out. Also, for instance, emails that conform to certain business templates may be filtered out. Also, for instance, emails that are likely spam may be filtered out. In some implementations, the selection engine 130 selects electronic communications based on other attribute(s) associated with the communications and\/or the sender(s) and\/or recipient(s) of the communications. For example, if it is desirable to determine relationships between original message features and reply n-grams for a particular geographic region and\/or domain, communications associated with that geographic region and\/or domain may be selected. In various implementations, training examples system 140 includes an original message features determination engine 142 and a non-textual reply content features engine 144. In some implementations, all or aspects of engines 142 and\/or 144 may be omitted, combined, and\/or implemented in a component that is separate from training examples system 140. Generally, the original message features determination engine 142 and the non-textual reply content features engine 144 work in concert and determine a plurality of training examples, each based on a corresponding one of a plurality of electronic communications having an original message and a reply message. For a given electronic communication having an original message and a reply message, the original message features determination engine 142 determines a vector of original message features based on the original message of the given electronic communication, and the non-textual reply content features engine 144 determines a vector of one or more features of non-textual reply content based on the reply message of the given electronic communication. The vector of original message features and the vector of one or more features of non-textual reply content that are included in the training examples will be dependent on the desired input parameters and desired output parameter(s) of the implementation of the machine learning system 135A. For example, assume the machine learning system 135A is being trained to provide, as output, a likelihood that a reply to an electronic communication will include a document and\/or a link to a document. In such a situation the non-textual reply content features engine 144 may generate training examples that each include a vector of one or more non-textual reply content features that is a single feature that is either \u201ctrue\u201d (includes a document and\/or a link to a document) or \u201cfalse\u201d (does not include a document and\/or a link to a document). As another example, assume the machine learning system 135A is being trained to provide, as output: 1) a likelihood that a reply to an electronic communication includes a word processing document and\/or a link to a word processing document; 2) a likelihood that a reply to an electronic communication includes a presentation and\/or a link to a presentation; 3) a likelihood that a reply to an electronic communication includes an image and\/or a link to an image; 4) a likelihood that a reply to an electronic communication includes a video and\/or a link to a video; and 5) optionally likelihood(s) for additional and\/or alternative document type(s). In such a situation the non-textual reply content features engine 144 may generate training examples that each include a vector of a plurality of reply content features that are each either \u201ctrue\u201d (includes a document of that type and\/or a link to a document of that type) or \u201cfalse\u201d (does not include a document of that type and\/or a link to a document of that type). Various original message features may be determined by the original message features determination engine 142 such as syntactic, semantic, n-gram, and\/or metadata based features. For example, one or more original message features may indicate whether a particular n-gram is present in one or more locations of an original message, or whether any n-gram of a particular class of n-grams is present in one or more locations of an original message. A class of n-grams may be, for example, a group of n-grams that have similar semantic meaning, such as a group of \u201crequesting verbs\u201d such as \u201cprovide\u201d, \u201csend\u201d, \u201cinclude\u201d, \u201ccan\u201d, \u201cattach\u201d, etc. As another example, an original message feature may indicate a quantity of recipients of the original email, such as \u201cone\u201d, \u201ctwo to five\u201d, or \u201cfive or more.\u201d As yet another example, an original message feature may indicate a semantic feature of one or more portions of an original message, such as a semantic feature of a subject of the original message, all or portions of the body of the original message, etc. In some implementations, the original message features determination engine 142 may determine one or more semantic features of an original message based on grouping electronic communications into a plurality of clusters, and determine the semantic features of the original message based on its cluster. In some of those implementations, the original message features determination engine 142 groups the electronic communications into a plurality of clusters based on similarities between the text of the original messages of the electronic communications of the corpus, such as semantic, syntactic, and\/or textual similarities. Generally, the original messages of electronic communications that are grouped in a given cluster will be more similar to one another (based on the similarities utilized in the grouping) than to the original messages grouped in other clusters. Each of the determined clusters corresponds to a different semantic category of content of the original message. In some implementations, the original message features determination engine 142 may utilize one or more clustering techniques in grouping electronic communications into a plurality of clusters based on similarity measures between the original messages. For example, in some implementations x-means clustering may be utilized, with the distance between original messages being based on the similarity measures between the original messages. Generally, x-means clustering is an unsupervised method of finding the ideal k to use for k-means clustering. Generally, k-means clustering aims to partition observations into a plurality of groups, with each observation being included in a group with which it is most related. Additional and\/or alternative clustering techniques may optionally be used. The training examples generated by the training examples system 140 for the machine learning system 135A are provided to the machine learning system 135A to train the machine learning system 135A. During training, the machine learning system 135A iteratively learns a hierarchy of feature representations based on the training examples generated by the training examples system 140. Turning now to FIG. 6, an example is illustrated of how training examples may be generated based on electronic communications and used to train a machine learning system to determine one or more non-textual reply content features. The selection engine 130 may select, based on one or more criteria, communications from electronic communications database 152 that are to be utilized to generate training examples for training the machine learning system 135A. For example, the selection engine 130 may flag or otherwise annotate certain communications of the electronic communications database 152 as those that are appropriate for utilization in generating training examples. For each of a plurality of the electronic communications, the original message features determination engine 142 determines a vector of original message features based on the original message of the given electronic communication and includes the original message features as input parameters of a corresponding training example 145. The non-textual reply content features engine 144 determines a vector of one or more non-textual reply content features based on the reply message of the given electronic communication and includes the non-textual reply content features as output parameter(s) of the corresponding training example 145. The training example 145 is utilized to train the machine learning system 135A. Although only a single training example 145 is illustrated in FIG. 6, it is understood that the engines 142 and 144 will generate a plurality of training examples (each being based on a corresponding electronic communication) and the plurality of training examples utilized to train the machine learning system 135A. As one specific implementation of FIG. 6, the training example 145 and all additional training examples may each have an output parameter indicative of type(s) of document(s) included in a reply message of a corresponding electronic communication and one or more input parameters based on the original message of the corresponding electronic communication. For instance, the non-textual reply content features engine 144 may generate, based on a reply message that includes an image as an attachment, non-textual reply content features for an output of a first training example that includes an indication of a document type of \u201cimage\u201d. The original message features determination engine 142 may generate, based on a corresponding original message, original message features as an input of the first training example. The original message features may include, for example, one or more syntactic, semantic, and\/or n-gram based features of the original message. Also, for instance, the non-textual reply content features engine 144 may generate, based on a reply message that includes a \u201cPDF\u201d as an attachment, non-textual reply content features for an output of a second training example that includes an indication of a document type of \u201cPDF\u201d. The original message features determination engine 142 may generate, based on a corresponding original message, original message features as an input of the second training example. The original message features may include, for example, one or more syntactic, semantic, and\/or n-gram based features of the original message. Additional training examples may be similarly generated, including additional examples each having output features based on other type(s) of documents of a corresponding reply message of an additional electronic communication and input features based on a corresponding original message of the additional electronic communication. The machine learning system may be trained based on the training examples. The trained machine learning system may receive, as input, one or more message features of an original message and provide, as output, one or more types of documents and optionally associated likelihoods to be included in a reply to the original message. The trained machine learning system may be utilized, for example, to determine, for future electronic communications, one or more search parameters based on the type(s) of documents provided as output by the trained machine learning system and\/or to restrict the corpus(es) of an issued search based on the type(s) of documents provided as output by the trained machine learning system. As another specific implementation of FIG. 6, the training example 145 and all additional training examples may each have an output parameter indicative of likelihood a document is included in a reply message of a corresponding electronic communication and one or more input parameters based on the original message of the corresponding electronic communication. For instance, the non-textual reply content features engine 144 may generate, based on a reply message that includes an attached document and\/or a link to a document, non-textual reply content features for an output of a first positive training example that includes an indication of \u201cdocument included in reply\u201d. The original message features determination engine 142 may generate, based on a corresponding original message, original message features as an input of the first training example. The original message features may include, for example, one or more syntactic, semantic, and\/or n-gram based features of the original message. Also, for instance, the non-textual reply content features engine 144 may generate, based on a reply message does not include document and\/or a link to a document, non-textual reply content features for an output of a second negative training example that includes an indication of \u201cdocument not included in reply\u201d. The original message features determination engine 142 may generate, based on a corresponding original message, original message features as an input of the second training example. The original message features may include, for example, one or more syntactic, semantic, and\/or n-gram based features of the original message. Additional training examples may be similarly generated. The trained machine learning system may receive, as input, one or more features of an original message and provide, as output, a likelihood that a document will be included in a reply to the original message. The trained machine learning system may be utilized, for example, to determine, for future electronic communications, whether and\/or how attachments are provided for inclusion in a reply to those electronic communications (e.g., a low likelihood that a reply will include an attachment may lead to no attachments being provided, or the attachments being \u201csuggested\u201d in a less conspicuous manner). FIG. 7 is a flow chart illustrating an example method of generating training examples and using the training examples to train a machine learning system to determine one or more non-textual reply content features. For convenience, the operations of the flow chart are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems. For instance, some operations may be performed by one or more components of the training example system 140 and\/or the machine learning system 135A of FIG. 5. Moreover, while operations of the method of FIG. 7 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added. At block 700, the system identifies electronic communications. Each of the electronic communications includes an original message and a reply message. At block 705, the system generates input features of a training example based on the original message of one of the electronic communications. Various original message features may be determined by the system such as syntactic, semantic, n-gram, and\/or metadata based features. At block 710, the system generates output feature(s) of the training example based on non-textual reply content associated with the reply message of the electronic communication. For example, in one implementation the output feature(s) may be either \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d and will be true if the reply message includes a document and\/or link to a document, and false otherwise. Also, for example, in another implementation the output feature(s) may be include multiple features that are each either \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d, and that are each indicative of whether the reply message includes a document of a corresponding file type that indicates a closed class of one or more filename extensions. For instance, a first feature may indicate \u201cimages\u201d that indicates a closed class of images (e.g., .jpg, .png, .gif), a second feature may indicate \u201cpresentations\u201d that indicates a closed class of presentations (e.g., .pdf, .ppt), etc. At block 715, the system trains a machine learning system based on the training example. Although the method of FIG. 7 is described with respect to a single training example, it is understood that one or more of the steps (e.g., blocks 705, 710, and 715) may be performed iteratively to determine multiple training examples and train the machine learning system based on the multiple training examples. In situations in which the systems described herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current geographic location), or to control whether and\/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. Also, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personal identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personal identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where geographic location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular geographic location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and\/or used. FIG. 8 is a block diagram of an example computing device 810. Computing device 810 typically includes at least one processor 814 which communicates with a number of peripheral devices via bus subsystem 812. These peripheral devices may include a storage subsystem 824, including, for example, a memory subsystem 825 and a file storage subsystem 826, user interface output devices 820, user interface input devices 822, and a network interface subsystem 816.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 illustrates an example environment in which a corpus of outgoing communications may be analyzed by various components of the present disclosure to generate one or more outgoing communication templates, in accordance with various implementations. FIG. 2 depicts how generated outgoing communication templates may be applied to subsequent outgoing communications, in accordance with various implementations. FIG. 3 depicts on example of an outgoing communication that may be used to create an outgoing communication template, in accordance with various implementations. FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrates an example of how an outgoing communication template generated using outgoing communications like that of FIG. 3 may later be applied to automatically populate at least a portion of a subsequent outgoing communication, in accordance with various implementations. FIG. 5 depicts a flow chart illustrating an example method of generating and applying outgoing communication templates. FIG. 6 schematically depicts an example architecture of a computer system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 illustrates an example environment in which a corpus of outgoing communications 100 may be grouped into clusters 1521-n, and in which clusters 1521-n of outgoing communications may be analyzed to generate outgoing communication templates 1541-n. As used herein, an \u201coutgoing communication\u201d may refer to an email (e.g., text\/plain), a text message (e.g., SMS, MMS), an instant message, a letter, a social media message, a dictated voice message, or any other outgoing communication that tends to conform to some sort of pattern. In some implementations, a context annotation engine 122 may be configured to identify one or more contextual attributes of users who sent the outgoing communications 100, e.g., at the time the users sent the communications 100 and\/or at a time that is contemporaneous with the users sending the communications (e.g., as part of a daily routine performed by an employee). Context annotation engine 122 may identify these contextual attributes in various ways. For example, emails may include various metadata such as one or more sender identifiers (e.g., sender email addresses), one or more recipient identifiers (e.g., recipient email addresses, including cc\u2032d and bcc\u2032d recipients), a date sent, a time sent, one or more attachments, a subject, and so forth. Context annotation engine 122 may analyze metadata of outgoing communications 100 to determine one or more attributes of contexts of users who sent the communications. Other contextual attributes of users may include, for instance, geographic locations of users while preparing\/sending outgoing communications, time of day when preparing\/sending outgoing communications, social networking statuses, and so forth. In some implementations, one or more contextual attributes may additionally or alternatively be determined from an incoming communication to which the outgoing communication is meant to reply. For example, suppose the incoming communication makes a particular request, or is from a particular requesting party (e.g., an auditor, an attorney, etc.). Those pieces of information may be taken into consideration as attributes of the responding user's context. In some implementations, context annotation engine 122 may identify attributes of user contexts from sources other than the outgoing communications themselves. For example, context annotation engine 122 may be in communication with one or more servers (not depicted) that facilitate transmission of outgoing communications, such as one or more email servers. Context annotation engine 122 may request information about a user's context when sending a particular outgoing communication 100 from such servers, e.g., at the time context annotation engine 122 is analyzing the outgoing communication 100. Additionally or alternatively, context annotation engine 122 may be in communication with individual client devices (not depicted) operated by users to send outgoing communications 100. These individual client devices may, for instance, store a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the sending user's context to be made available to context annotation engine 122 on demand. In some implementations, individual client devices may be configured (e.g., via a plugin) to incorporate user context information into outgoing communications 100 when those communications are sent, so that context annotation engine 122 may identify those attributes when performing its analysis. In some implementations, a cluster engine 124 may be configured to group the corpus of annotated outgoing communications 100 into a plurality of clusters 1521-n based on one or more attributes shared among contexts of users who sent one or more outgoing communications 100 within the corpus. In some implementations, cluster engine 124 may have one or more preliminary filtering mechanisms to discard outgoing communications that are not suitable for template generation. For example, if a corpus of outgoing communications 100 under analysis includes emails that are not similar contextually and\/or syntactically\/semantically to any other emails and thus are not suitable for clustering, those emails may be discarded. Cluster engine 124 may additionally or alternatively utilize various attributes of outgoing communications 100 to group outgoing communications 100 into clusters, such as metadata similarity, textual similarities, byte similarities, shared patterns, and so forth. For example, in some implementations, outgoing communications such as emails may be clustered additionally or alternatively based on textual similarities. For example, emails may be analyzed to determine shared terms, phrases, n-grams, n-grams plus frequencies, and so forth. Based on these data points, emails may be clustered. For example, emails sharing a particular number of shared phrases and n-grams may be clustered together. In some implementations, emails may even be grouped into clusters based on byte similarity. For instance, emails may be viewed as strings of bytes that may include one or both of metadata and textual content. In yet other implementations, outgoing communications may be grouped together based on edit distances between them satisfying one or more thresholds (e.g., if less than n words have to be changed to match two outgoing communications, those two outgoing communications may be grouped into a cluster). In some implementations, a weighted combination of two or more of the above-described techniques may be used as well. Once a corpus of outgoing communications 100 are grouped into clusters 1521-n, each cluster 152 may contain outgoing communications that are highly likely to include the same or similar fixed content (e.g., boilerplate), and to have transient content in approximately the same locations, e.g., spatially and\/or relative to fixed segments. A segment classification engine 128 and template generation engine 132 may then perform various downstream processing to generate outgoing communication templates 1541-n for clusters 1521-n. Segment classification engine 128 may be configured to selectively classify segments of outgoing communications as fixed or transient using various criteria and\/or techniques. In some implementations, segment classification engine 128 may store segments of a particular cluster it classifies as fixed in a dictionary or vocabulary it generates for that cluster (e.g., as a \u201cbag of words or phrases\u201d). In some implementations, segment classification engine 128 may employ shingling, e.g., to find the longest runs of fixed text in plain text communications of a cluster. In some implementations, segment classification engine 128 may employ tokenization to further analyze undecided segments. In some implementations, segment classification engine 128 may classify a particular segment as fixed in response to a determination, e.g., by segment classification engine 128, that a particular criterion has been satisfied. Various criteria may be used to determine that a particular segment of text is fixed. One criterion that may be used by segment classification engine 128 to determine whether segments of text are fixed is a threshold. For instance, if a count of occurrences of a segment of text across a particular cluster satisfies a particular threshold number of outgoing communications or a percentage, it may be considered fixed. Suppose a particular segment of text such as \u201cI have looked into your file . . . \u201d or \u201cThank you for your inquiry . . . \u201d is shared among a large number of emails in a cluster (or even among all emails). That segment of text is likely boilerplate. Segment classification engine 128 may classify that segment of text as \u201cfixed.\u201d In some implementations, fixed phrases may be identified in a cluster of outgoing communications using one or more variations of a so-called \u201csuffix array.\u201d In some implementations, a set of outgoing communications such as those grouped into a particular cluster may be provided as input, along with a suffix array (e.g., a lexicographically sorted array of all suffixes of an outgoing communication) and\/or a longest common prefix. A suffix-array-based algorithm may include a loop that iterates over the suffixes in the suffix array to determine, at each step, whether the suffix under examination satisfies a minimum length threshold, and whether the suffix occurs at a frequency among outgoing communications of the cluster that satisfies a frequency threshold. In some implementations, words may be considered in addition to or instead of letters. In some such implementations, the algorithm may check whether the prefix starts with a real word (e.g., is it preceded by a whitespace?), contains at least one word, and\/or whether the prefix occurred in a distinct outgoing communication. The output of various suffix-array-based algorithms may be, for example, a map (e.g., <phrase, document count>) of phrases, subphrases of those phrases, and so forth. That output may be analyzed, e.g., by segment classification engine 128, to identify fixed and\/or transient segments. In various implementations, segment classification engine 128 may classify remaining segments of text that do not satisfy various fixed text criteria such as those described above as \u201ctransient.\u201d In some implementations, the output of segment classification engine 128 is one or more sequences of classified (e.g., \u201cfixed\u201d or \u201ctransient\u201d) segments of text. Template generation engine 132 may be configured to generate, based on sequences of classified segments associated with each communication of the particular cluster that are provided by segment classification engine 128, outgoing communication templates 1541-n. Those outgoing communication templates 154 may be usable to automatically populate at least a portion of one or more subsequent outgoing communications. Operations performed by cluster engine 124, segment classification engine 128, and\/or template generation engine 132 may be performed on individual computer systems, distributed across multiple computer systems, or any combination of the two. These one or more computer systems may be in communication with each other and other computer systems over one or more networks (not depicted). FIG. 2 depicts an example of how a subsequent outgoing communication 200 undergoing preparation based at least partially on received user input 238 may be analyzed after a plurality of outgoing communication templates 1541, have been generated. Various components of FIG. 2 may be implemented on a computing device operated by a user preparing to send an outgoing communication, on a remote computing system, or on any combination of the two. In FIG. 2, a template selection engine 239 may be configured to employ various techniques to select one or more outgoing communication templates for application to outgoing communication 200. Template selection engine 239 may perform this selection at various points in time using various techniques. In some implementations, template selection engine 239 may determine the user's context at the moment the user begins preparing outgoing communication 200. In some implementations, template selection engine 239 may additionally or alternatively determine a similarity between outgoing communication 200 and templates 1541-154n at various points as the user types, such as after the user fills in various metadata fields (e.g., recipient, subject, attachments, etc.), after the user types sufficient message content to perform a meaningful similarity comparison between subsequent outgoing communication 200 and templates 1541-154n, and so forth. The more often such similarity comparisons are performed, the better performance may be achieved by having one or more components of FIG. 2 operating locally, e.g., on a computing device being operated by the user to draft outgoing communication 200. Based on the decision of template selection engine 239, an auto generation engine 240 may select and apply an outgoing communication template (e.g., one of 1541-n) to auto generate data to be used to populate appropriate portions of outgoing communication 200. For example, in this example, auto generation engine 240 has selected template 1542 as the best match to outgoing communication 200, and has provided data it automatically generated using template 1542 for use in automatically populating portions of outgoing communication 200. FIG. 3 depicts a hypothetical outgoing communication in the form of an email 300 that may be grouped into a cluster with other similar emails, which then collectively may be used to generate outgoing communication templates, in accordance with various implementations. Email 300 includes various metadata, visible examples of which include a recipient email address (\u201cABC@DEF.GHI\u201d), a carbon copied address (\u201cCOMPTROLLER@DEF.GHI\u201d), a date sent 352 (Nov. 12, 2014), and a subject (\u201cMY DAILY REPORT\u201d). Suppose that the sender of email 300 prepares and sends a similarly-structured email to the same recipients under a similar context each day (e.g., at or near the same time of day, in response to an incoming communication that matches a pattern, etc.). Those sent emails (which may be stored, for instance, in the user's sent mail folder and\/or in a recipients mailbox) may be clustered together based on various signals, such as one attributes of the sending user's context when he or she sent them, on textual similarity between email 300 and other similar emails, and so forth. Textual similarity between emails may be determined using the raw text of emails, reduced-dimensionality feature sets created using emails (e.g., \u201cbags of words\u201d) and various related statistics (e.g., term frequency-inverse document frequency), and so forth. Various techniques may be deployed to determine similarity between emails, including but not limited to cosine similarity and\/or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Once email 300 and other similar emails are grouped into a cluster, segments of text in email 300 and other emails of the cluster that satisfy various criteria, such as a frequency threshold, may be classified (e.g., by segment classification engine 128) as fixed. Segments of text that do not satisfy such thresholds, or that satisfy other thresholds associated with transient content, may be classified (e.g., by segment classification engine 128) as transient. In email 300, for instance, many of the segments of text may be repeated across similar emails the sender frequently sends under similar circumstances (i.e. in the same or similar context), and thus may be classified as fixed. For example, segments 354-366 may all tend to be segments that do not change much across emails. Some of these segments may be entirely static, such as the labels \u201cACCOUNTS PAYABLE\u201d (356), \u201cACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\u201d (358), \u201cREMAINING ANNUAL BUDGET\u201d (360), \u201cCOMMENTS\u201d (362), and text 366 added by the sender to incorporate delineating visual structure to email 300, which in this example is a series of \u201c+\u201d signs. Other segments may not necessarily be static but may be directly tied to various aspects of email 300. For example, the date 354 at the top of the report may always be the same as the date 352 on which email 300 was drafted and\/or sent. Similarly, the signature 364 may always be the same as the name of the sender or to some predefined signature block selected by the sender or the sender's employer. Other segments of text may not necessarily be repeated across email 300 and other emails of the cluster. These less repetitive segments may constitute transient content that may not be as useful when attempting to automatically populate at least a portion of a subsequent outgoing communication. For example, segments 368-374 may include unique information such as a current value of an accounts payable (368) or receivable (370), a current budget (372), or even user-drafted comments (374). These transient segments of text may be classified as transient, e.g., by segment classification engine 128. Once segments of email 300 and other emails in the same cluster are classified, an outgoing communication template may be generated, e.g., by template generation engine 132, for that cluster using various combinations of the techniques described above. Content classified as transient that is unlikely shared among more than a few emails of the cluster may be discarded or otherwise disregarded. For example, segments (368 and 370) following the \u201cACCOUNTS PAYABLE:\u201d and \u201cACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE:\u201d segments may be considered transient because it is unlikely that more than a small fraction of the emails in the cluster will contain the exact same text associated with these segments of text. The same goes for other pieces of information, like the typed comments after the fixed text \u201cCOMMENTS:\u201d. On the other hand, fixed content, such as 354-366, may be added to the outgoing communication template. When the sender of email 300 (or another sender having a similar context) later sets out to type and send an email that is sufficiently similar to email 300 and other emails of the cluster, that subsequent email may automatically be at least partially populated. An example of this is depicted in FIGS. 4A-B, with similar elements numbered similarly as in FIG. 3 except beginning with a \u201c4\u201d instead of a \u201c3\u201d. In FIG. 4A, an outgoing email 400 is being drafted, e.g., by the same user that sent email 300 or a different user having a similar context (e.g., under similar circumstances). In this example, the sender had gotten as far as typing the recipient (ABC@DEF.GHI) and the cc recipient (COMPTROLLER@DEF.GHI), and is in the midst of typing the subject (\u201cMY DAILY REP|\u201d). At this point, a component such as template selection engine 239 and\/or auto generation engine 240 may determine that content of email 400 and\/or the context in which email 400 is being drafted is sufficiently similar to that of email 300 that the outgoing communication template should be applied to populate the remainder of email 400. When that happens, an outgoing communication template may be selected and applied to automatically populate one or more portions of email 400. For example, in FIG. 4B, the entire message of the email has been populated with either segments of text classified as fixed as described above (e.g., segments 444-466), or fillable placeholders for segments deemed transient (e.g., segments 468-474). In other implementations, more or less of a message may be auto-populated. For example, in some implementations, shorter snippets of text may be populated in front of the location at which the user is currently inputting text (e.g., as autocompletions and\/or as options in a pull down (also referred to as a \u201cdrop down\u201d) menu). One or more graphical elements, such as one or more drop down menu selectable options, may appear that enable the user to select, accept, and\/or reject the auto-populated text as it appears. While examples described herein have included fillable fields, this is not required. In some implementations, an outgoing communication template may include only fixed text, and may populate subsequent outgoing communications only with that fixed text. In some implementations, different outgoing communication templates may be selected and\/or applied as the user provides more input text. For example, outgoing templates may be re-checked after every keystroke, after input of each word, after each sentence, every few seconds, etc., to determine whether, given the text provided by the user, there is a \u201cbetter-matching\u201d outgoing communication template. The more frequently comparisons are made between the thus-far input text and outgoing communication templates, the more beneficial it may be to host the templates and\/or the processes\/engines that apply them locally on a computing device that is used by the user to prepare email 400. This may, for example, reduce lag and\/or latency. Referring now to FIG. 5, an example method 500 of clustering outgoing communications and generating outgoing communication templates is described. For convenience, the operations of the flow chart are described with reference to a system that performs the operations. This system may include various components of various computer systems. Moreover, while operations of method 500 are shown in a particular order, this is not meant to be limiting. One or more operations may be reordered, omitted or added. At block 502, the system may group a corpus of outgoing communications (e.g., emails in a user's sent email folder, emails in a group of users' sent email folders, etc.) into a plurality of clusters. Each outgoing communication may be grouped into a cluster based at least in part on one or more contextual attributes of the sender that sent the communication, e.g., at the time the outgoing communication was sent or contemporaneously with preparation and sending of that communication. Additionally or alternatively, one or more attributes of the communications themselves, such as their metadata, content (e.g., textual, html) similarity to other communications, etc., may be used to group the communications into clusters. As noted above, various attributes of a user's context may be considered when grouping a communication into a cluster. In some implementations, a relationship between the user and a recipient of the outgoing communication may be considered. For example, if the recipient has a particular title or rank, and that title or rank places the sender above or below the recipient in a hierarchy, that relationship may weigh in favor of grouping the communication into a particular cluster of communications, e.g., from similarly-ranked\/titled senders to similarly-ranked\/titled recipients. As another example, geographic coordinates of the user, e.g., sensed by a mobile computing device operated by the user to send the outgoing communication, may be considered when clustering the outgoing communication. Suppose the sender is located at a particular worksite (e.g., a construction site, client place of business, disaster zone, battlefield, etc.). The sender's geographic coordinates may be used, e.g., in tandem with information about the sender's task while at the worksite (e.g., to provide a particular type of report), to group the communication into a cluster with other outgoing communications produced under the same or similar circumstances\/contexts. In some implementations, one or more entries of an electronic calendar of the sender may be used, alone or in tandem with other contextual attributes described herein, to group one or more communications sent by the sender into a particular cluster. Suppose the sender's calendar indicates that the sender is scheduled to be engaged in a particular activity at regularly scheduled time intervals. Suppose further that while engaged in the activity, the sender tends to send emails having very similar structure (e.g., the same or similar fixed content). Emails created and\/or sent by the sender during the time intervals indicated by the sender's calendar may be grouped into a cluster. In some implementations, a social networking status of the sender may be used, alone or in tandem with other contextual attributes described herein, to group one or more communications sent by the sender into a particular cluster. For example, suppose the sender's status is, for a time, \u201chunkered down getting out tax reports.\u201d Emails sent by the sender while the user's social media status is set to \u201chunkered down getting out tax reports\u201d that also satisfy a particular similarity threshold may be grouped into a cluster. However, emails sent by the sender while his or her social media status is set differently may be required to satisfy a different, e.g., higher, similarity threshold. In some implementations, and as alluded to above, in addition to or instead of being grouped into clusters based on sender contextual attributes, outgoing communications may be grouped into clusters based on one or more attributes of a recipient's context. These recipient contextual attributes may include any of those contextual attributes mentioned above, such as recipient's location when message received and\/or opened, recipient's status when received and\/or opened, recipient's title, etc.). Once the outgoing communications of the corpus are grouped into clusters, at block 504, the system may classify one or more segments of each outgoing communication of a particular cluster as fixed. Example criteria for classifying a segment of text as fixed are described above. At block 506, the system may classify remaining unclassified segments of each outgoing communication of the particular cluster as transient. At block 508, the system may generate, e.g., for each cluster into which outgoing communications were grouped at block 502, an outgoing communication template. The outgoing communication template may be generated based at least in part on the segments classified at block 504 and\/or 506. Outgoing communication templates may come in various forms. For example, in some implementations, they may include fixed text segments and then various types of wildcards (e.g., regular expressions) in the place of segments that were classified transient. The wildcards may, for instance, be manifested in a user interface of a user in the form of a fillable field, similar to 468-474 in FIG. 4B. At some point after one or more outgoing communications are generated at block 508, the system may determine that it is time to apply one or more outgoing communication templates. For example, in some implementations, a user may receive a communication such as an email that conforms to a particular pattern, and a draft response may be automatically populated using one or more templates. Additionally or alternatively, and as is depicted in FIG. 5, the system may determine at block 510 that a user is preparing a subsequent outgoing communication using a computing device. For example, the user may have operated a smart phone to open a graphical user interface that facilitates drafting of a new email or text message. Or, the user may have initiated dictation software to draft new outgoing correspondence. However the system determines that it is time to automatically populate at least a portion of an outgoing message, at block 512, the system may select an outgoing communication template that best matches the subsequent outgoing communication being drafted and\/or the context of the user that is drafting it. For example, suppose the user is on his or her way home from work and begins dictating a text message \u201cOn my way home . . . want|\u201d. The system may recognize that the user's context indicates that the user is at the end of his or her shift, that the user has boarded public transportation or has begun travelling from work towards home in an automobile, etc. The system may then compare content of a subset of one or more outgoing communication templates that match that context (i.e., were created using outgoing communications the user prepared and sent under similar circumstances) with content thus far prepared in the subsequent outgoing communication. Whichever outgoing communication template of the subset is most similar to the outgoing communication currently being prepared may be selected as the \u201cbest match.\u201d At block 514, the system may apply the selected outgoing communication template to automatically populate at least a portion of the user's outgoing communication. In the example above, for instance, an outgoing template may be applied to automatically complete the user's outgoing message as follows: \u201cOn my way home . . . want me to stop at the store to pick up baby formula?\u201d FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an example computer system 610. Computer system 610 typically includes at least one processor 614 which communicates with a number of peripheral devices via bus subsystem 612. These peripheral devices may include a storage subsystem 624, including, for example, a memory subsystem 625 and a file storage subsystem 626, user interface output devices 620, user interface input devices 622, and a network interface subsystem 616. The input and output devices allow user interaction with computer system 610. Network interface subsystem 616 provides an interface to outside networks and is coupled to corresponding interface devices in other computer systems. User interface input devices 622 may include a keyboard, pointing devices such as a mouse, trackball, touchpad, or graphics tablet, a scanner, a touchscreen incorporated into the display, audio input devices such as voice recognition systems, microphones, and\/or other types of input devices. In general, use of the term \u201cinput device\u201d is intended to include all possible types of devices and ways to input information into computer system 610 or onto a communication network. User interface output devices 620 may include a display subsystem, a printer, a fax machine, or non-visual displays such as audio output devices. The display subsystem may include a cathode ray tube (CRT), a flat-panel device such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), a projection device, or some other mechanism for creating a visible image. The display subsystem may also provide non-visual display such as via audio output devices. In general, use of the term \u201coutput device\u201d is intended to include all possible types of devices and ways to output information from computer system 610 to the user or to another machine or computer system. Storage subsystem 624 stores programming and data constructs that provide the functionality of some or all of the modules described herein. For example, the storage subsystem 624 may include the logic to perform selected aspects of method 500 and\/or to implement one or more of cluster engine 124, segment classification engine 128, template generation engine 132, template selection engine 239, and\/or auto generation engine 240. These software modules are generally executed by processor 614 alone or in combination with other processors. Memory 625 used in the storage subsystem 624 can include a number of memories including a main random access memory (RAM) 630 for storage of instructions and data during program execution and a read only memory (ROM) 632 in which fixed instructions are stored. A file storage subsystem 626 can provide persistent storage for program and data files, and may include a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive along with associated removable media, a CD-ROM drive, an optical drive, or removable media cartridges. The modules implementing the functionality of certain implementations may be stored by file storage subsystem 626 in the storage subsystem 624, or in other machines accessible by the processor(s) 614. Bus subsystem 612 provides a mechanism for letting the various components and subsystems of computer system 610 communicate with each other as intended. Although bus subsystem 612 is shown schematically as a single bus, alternative implementations of the bus subsystem may use multiple busses. Computer system 610 can be of varying types including a workstation, server, computing cluster, blade server, server farm, or any other data processing system or computing device. Due to the ever-changing nature of computers and networks, the description of computer system 610 depicted in FIG. 6 is intended only as a specific example for purposes of illustrating some implementations. Many other configurations of computer system 610 are possible having more or fewer components than the computer system depicted in FIG. 6. In situations in which the systems described herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current geographic location), or to control whether and\/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. Also, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personal identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personal identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where geographic location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular geographic location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and\/or used. While several implementations have been described and illustrated herein, a variety of other means and\/or structures for performing the function and\/or obtaining the results and\/or one or more of the advantages described herein may be utilized, and each of such variations and\/or modifications is deemed to be within the scope of the implementations described herein. More generally, all parameters, dimensions, materials, and configurations described herein are meant to be exemplary and that the actual parameters, dimensions, materials, and\/or configurations will depend upon the specific application or applications for which the teachings is\/are used. Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific implementations described herein. It is, therefore, to be understood that the foregoing implementations are presented by way of example only and that, within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereto, implementations may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described and claimed.

Virtual reality (VR) devices deliver media to users based at least in part on the position and movement of a headset worn by a user. Some VR devices deliver media augmenting or interacting with an environment in which the user is using the headset, or influenced by objects or features in the environment. For example, the VR device may display media to the user that includes virtual objects placed within the user's environment. To display media based on the user's environment, these VR devices often include a camera that maps out features in the environment. However, using a single camera to map features in the environment does not provide enough information to accurately identify the features in the environment or permit the determination of scale of those features. Likewise, there may not be enough information to determine the position of the VR headset relative to the features. Thus, the media presented by these systems may not accurately follow the actual position of the VR headset.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>A virtual reality (VR) system uses two or more cameras mounted on a virtual reality headset worn by a user to map an environment in which the headset is used and present media to the user based at least in part on the environment. The two or more cameras capture image data of the environment, and each has a field of view corresponding to an angle of the environment visible to the imaging electronics of the camera. A portion of the fields of view of the cameras overlap, while a portion of the fields of view do not overlap. The portion that does not overlap increases the area of the environment that can be imaged by the cameras, while the overlapping portions enables correlation of the image data to improve the accuracy of the environment's mapping and provide a scale for the objects in the environment. A processor in the VR headset or in a system external to the headset receives the image data from the cameras. The processor uses the image data captured by the first camera to identify a first observation of a position of the VR headset in the environment and positions of a plurality of features in the environment. The features in the environment may include, for example, lines, corners, or edges detected in the image data captured by the first camera. The processor similarly uses the image data captured by the second camera to identify a second observation of the position of the VR headset in the environment and positions of the features. Based on the first observation and the second observation, the processor generates a three-dimensional model of the environment. The three-dimensional model of the environment includes a geometry of the environment, representing relative positions of features with respect to one another. The model may also include representations of objects or boundaries in the environment, which are determined based on the features identified in the environment. The VR system uses the mapped environment, including the model of the environment and the determined location of the headset within the environment, to present media to the user. For example, the content of the media displayed to the user may be based on the environment. As another example, the content of the media may be based on the movement of the user within the environment or the movement of objects in the environment.","description":"BACKGROUND The present disclosure generally relates to virtual reality systems, and more specifically relates to mapping an environment in which a virtual reality system is used.

However, using a single camera to map features in the environment does not provide enough information to accurately identify the features in the environment or permit the determination of scale of those features. Likewise, there may not be enough information to determine the position of the VR headset relative to the features. Thus, the media presented by these systems may not accurately follow the actual position of the VR headset. SUMMARY A virtual reality (VR) system uses two or more cameras mounted on a virtual reality headset worn by a user to map an environment in which the headset is used and present media to the user based at least in part on the environment. The two or more cameras capture image data of the environment, and each has a field of view corresponding to an angle of the environment visible to the imaging electronics of the camera. A portion of the fields of view of the cameras overlap, while a portion of the fields of view do not overlap. The portion that does not overlap increases the area of the environment that can be imaged by the cameras, while the overlapping portions enables correlation of the image data to improve the accuracy of the environment's mapping and provide a scale for the objects in the environment. A processor in the VR headset or in a system external to the headset receives the image data from the cameras. The processor uses the image data captured by the first camera to identify a first observation of a position of the VR headset in the environment and positions of a plurality of features in the environment. The features in the environment may include, for example, lines, corners, or edges detected in the image data captured by the first camera. The processor similarly uses the image data captured by the second camera to identify a second observation of the position of the VR headset in the environment and positions of the features. Based on the first observation and the second observation, the processor generates a three-dimensional model of the environment. The three-dimensional model of the environment includes a geometry of the environment, representing relative positions of features with respect to one another. The model may also include representations of objects or boundaries in the environment, which are determined based on the features identified in the environment. The VR system uses the mapped environment, including the model of the environment and the determined location of the headset within the environment, to present media to the user. For example, the content of the media displayed to the user may be based on the environment. As another example, the content of the media may be based on the movement of the user within the environment or the movement of objects in the environment.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Virtual Reality System Architecture FIG. 1 is a block diagram of one embodiment of a virtual reality (VR) system environment 100 in which a VR headset 105 operates. The system environment 100 shown by FIG. 1 comprises the VR headset 105 and a VR input interface 140 that are each coupled to a VR console 110. While FIG. 1 shows an example system 100 including one VR headset 105 and one VR input interface 140, in other embodiments any number of these components may be included in the system 100. For example, there may be multiple VR headsets 105 each having an associated VR input interface 140, with each VR headset 105 and VR input interface 140 communicating with the VR console 110. In alternative configurations, different and\/or additional components may be included in the system environment 100. As further described below, the VR headset 105 presents media to a user that is based at least in part on the environment in which the headset is operated. In an example application, the content of the media presented by VR headset 105, such as virtual objects or characters included in the media and the positions of the objects or characters, are based on the model of the environment. For example, if the user operates the VR headset 105 in a classroom with chairs and desks, the model includes representations of the chairs and desks and the media includes virtual characters displayed as sitting in the chairs and virtual objects displayed on the desks. As another example, if the user operates the VR headset in a park with walking paths, the model includes boundaries of the walking path and representations of trees adjacent to the path, and the media includes virtual characters displayed walking along the paths and virtual animals displayed in trees adjacent to the path. The VR headset 105 may alternatively display media based on the user's interaction with or movements relative to the features in the environment. For example, the media displayed may be influenced by the speed and distance a user runs along a path. As another example, a virtual object or character is moved based on the user's movement of a physical object in the environment. To present media based on the environment in which the VR headset 105 is operated, the VR headset 105 includes two cameras capturing image data of the environment. The image data from each camera is used to separately map the environment by identifying features in the environment and determining a position of the VR headset relative to the features. In one embodiment, as further described below, the image data from each camera is processed by a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm to identify the features and determine the headset's position. The features and position of the headset from the two image streams are then correlated, and the correlation is used to improve the accuracy of the headset's location relative to the features. The use of two cameras also provides binocular vision to determine a three-dimensional model of the features in the environment. Thus, using two cameras to image the environment improves the accuracy of determining the headset's position relative to the environment's features over systems using a single camera. The VR headset 105 is a head-mounted display that presents media to a user. Examples of media presented by the VR head set include one or more images, video, audio, or some combination thereof. In some embodiments, audio is presented via an external device (e.g., speakers and\/or headphones) that receives audio information from the VR headset 105, the VR console 110, or both, and presents audio data based on the audio information. In various embodiments, the VR headset 105 may comprise one or more rigid bodies, which may be rigidly or non-rigidly coupled to each other. A rigid coupling between rigid bodies causes the coupled rigid bodies to act as a single rigid entity. In contrast, a non-rigid coupling between rigid bodies allows the rigid bodies to move relative to each other. An example embodiment of the VR headset 105 is further described below in conjunction with FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 1, the VR headset 105 includes an electronic display 115, at least two cameras 120, one or more sensors 125, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) 130. The electronic display 115 displays images to the user in accordance with data received from the VR console 110. In various embodiments, the electronic display 115 may comprise a single electronic display or multiple electronic displays (e.g., a display for each eye of a user). In some embodiments, the media provided to the electronic display 115 for presentation to the user is pre-distorted to aid in correction of one or more types of optical errors. Additionally, the optical components may increase a field of view of the displayed media through magnification or through another suitable method. For example, the field of view of the displayed media is such that the displayed media is presented using a portion of the user's field of view (e.g., 110 degrees diagonal), or is displayed such that the displayed media is presented using all of the user's field of view (e.g., 180 degrees diagonal). The two or more cameras 120 capture image data of an environment in which the VR headset 105 is operated. In one embodiment, the cameras 120 record a continuous stream of video data while the VR headset 105 is operated that can be analyzed to detect points of interest in the environment. Alternatively, the cameras 120 may capture still-frame images at specified intervals of time (e.g., once every 0.5 seconds) while the VR headset 105 is operated. In one embodiment, at least part of the image data captured by the cameras 120 is displayed to the user of the headset 105 by the electronic display 115, enabling the user to view the surrounding environment and virtual augmentations to the environment. The IMU 130 is an electronic device that generates motion data based on measurement signals received from one or more of the sensors 125. The motion data includes, for example, translational or rotational velocity and translational or rotational acceleration of the VR headset 105. To generate the motion data, a sensor 125 generates one or more measurement signals in response to motion of the VR headset 105, and may measure the absolute position or inertial movement of the sensor. Examples of the sensors 125 include: one or more accelerometers, one or more gyroscopes, one or more magnetometers, or any other suitable type of sensor, or some combination thereof. The sensors 125 may be located external to the IMU 130, internal to the IMU 130, or some combination thereof. Based on the one or more measurement signals from one or more sensors 125, the IMU 130 generates motion data indicating an estimated position of the VR headset 105 relative to an initial position of the VR headset 105. For example, the sensors 125 include multiple accelerometers to measure translational motion (forward\/back, up\/down, left\/right) and multiple gyroscopes to measure rotational motion (e.g., pitch, yaw, roll). In some embodiments, the IMU 130 rapidly samples the measurement signals and calculates the estimated position of the VR headset 105 from the sampled data. For example, the IMU 130 integrates the measurement signals received from the accelerometers over time to estimate a velocity vector and integrates the velocity vector over time to determine an estimated position of a reference point (e.g., intermediate estimated position) on the VR headset 105. Alternatively, the IMU 130 provides the sampled measurement signals to the VR console 110, which determines the motion data. The reference point is a point that may be used to describe the position of the VR headset 105. The reference point may generally be defined as a point in space; however, in practice, the reference point is typically defined as a point within the VR headset 105 (e.g., a center of the IMU 130). The VR input interface 140 is a device that allows a user to send action requests to the VR console 110. An action request is a request to perform a particular action. For example, an action request may be to start or end an application or to perform a particular action within the application. The VR input interface 140 may include one or more input devices. Example input devices include: a keyboard, a mouse, a game controller, or any other suitable device for receiving action requests and communicating the received action requests to the VR console 110. An action request received by the VR input interface 140 is communicated to the VR console 110, which performs an action corresponding to the action request. In some embodiments, the VR input interface 140 may provide haptic feedback to the user in accordance with instructions received from the VR console 110. For example, haptic feedback is provided when an action request is received, or the VR console 110 communicates instructions to the VR input interface 140 causing the VR input interface 140 to generate haptic feedback when the VR console 110 performs an action. The VR console 110 provides media to the VR headset 105 for presentation to the user in accordance with information received from the VR headset 105 and the VR input interface 140. In the example shown in FIG. 1, the VR console 110 includes an application store 145, a mapping module 150, and a virtual reality (VR) engine 155. Some embodiments of the VR console 110 have different modules than those described in conjunction with FIG. 1. Similarly, the functions further described below may be distributed among components of the VR console 110 in a different manner than is described here. The application store 145 stores one or more applications for execution by the VR console 110. An application is a group of instructions that, when executed by a processor, generates media for presentation to the user. Media generated by an application may be in response to inputs received from the user via movement of the HR headset 105 or the VR interface device 140. Examples of applications include: gaming applications, conferencing applications, video playback application, or other suitable applications. The mapping module 150 maps the environment of the VR headset 105 and movements of the VR headset 105 within the environment using image data received from the cameras 120 and motion data received from the IMU 130. While FIG. 1 illustrates the mapping module 150 executed by the VR console 110 in one embodiment, one or more functions of the mapping module 150 may alternatively be executed by a processor within the VR headset 105. Generally, the mapping module 150 maps the environment by periodically performing two SLAM algorithms\u2014one for the image data received from each camera 120\u2014and correlating the outputs from each algorithm. The SLAM algorithms are described, for example, in S\u00f8ren Riisgaard and Morten Rufus Blas (2005), \u201cSLAM for Dummies: A Tutorial Approach to Simultaneous Localization and Mapping,\u201d MIT Open Courseware, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Generally, each SLAM algorithm uses image data from a camera to identify features in the environment, such as walls, corners, or edges of objects, that are visible to the camera at an initial position of the headset 105. The mapping module 150 determines the position of a point on the headset 105 relative to these features, such as a distance and angle between a reference point on the headset and each feature. The mapping module 150 also tracks movement of the VR headset 105 using motion data captured by the IMU 130. For example, as the headset 105 is moved, the mapping module 150 determines a magnitude and direction of the headset's movement, and continually estimates distances and angles between the reference point on the headset and expected positions of each of the features. When the VR headset 105 is moved to a new position, the mapping module 150 estimates a position of the VR headset 105 relative to the previously-identified features based on the motion data received from the IMU 130. The mapping module 150 also uses image data from each camera captured at the new position of the headset 105 to observe the features in the environment. These observations are compared to the position estimated based on the image data, and the comparison is used to update the position of the headset 105 relative to the features. After identifying the new position of the headset 105 relative to the known features, the mapping module 150 may identify one or more additional features in the environment using the image data. For example, the mapping module 150 identifies features that were not visible to the cameras at the initial position of the headset 105, but are visible at the new position. A process for mapping the environment and identifying the position of the headset in the environment is described further with respect to FIG. 4 The VR engine 155 executes applications within the system environment. Based at least in part on the features in the environment and the position of the VR headset 105 with respect to the features, the VR engine 155 determines media to provide to the VR headset 105 for presentation to the user. Additionally, the VR engine 155 performs an action within an application executing on the VR console 110 in response to an action request received from the VR input interface 140 and provides feedback to the user that the action was performed. The provided feedback may be visual or audible feedback via the VR headset 105 or haptic feedback via the VR input interface 140. FIG. 2 is a wire diagram of one embodiment of a virtual reality headset. The VR headset 200 is an embodiment of the VR headset 105 and includes a front rigid body 205 and a band 210. The band 210 supports the front rigid body 205 when the VR headset 105 is worn by a user. The front rigid body 205 includes the electronic display 115 (not shown), the IMU 130, the one or more sensors 125, and the two or more cameras 120. In the embodiment shown by FIG. 2, the sensors 125 are located within the IMU 130 and neither the sensors 125 nor the IMU 130 are visible to the user. Furthermore, FIG. 2 illustrates a reference point 215 located at a center of the IMU 130, which in one embodiment is used as a reference point for tracking movement of the headset 105 through the environment. The reference point 215 may alternatively be located at other positions on the headset 105. The cameras 120 are positioned on or within the front rigid body 205, and may not be visible to the user. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the cameras 120 are positioned near opposite sides of the front rigid body 205: the camera 120A is positioned near a left side of the front rigid body 205, while the camera 120B is positioned near a right side. Each camera 120 has a field of view corresponding to an angle of the environment visible to the camera when in a fixed position. In one embodiment, the field of view of the camera 120A partially overlaps the field of view of the camera 120B. Example fields of view of the cameras 120 are shown in FIG. 3. The first camera field of view 305A is an angle of the environment visible to the first camera 120A at a fixed position, while the second field of view 305B is an angle of the environment visible to the second camera 120B at a fixed position. As shown in FIG. 3, a portion of the field of view 305A overlaps a portion of the field of view 305B, while a portion of the field of view 305A does not overlap the field of view 305B. Similarly, a portion of the field of view 305B does not overlap the field of view 305A. The partial overlap between the fields of view 305A and 305B enables correlation between the features observed by both cameras, while the portions of the fields of view 305 that do not overlap increase the area of the environment that can be imaged by the cameras 120. Tracking a Virtual Reality Headset Using Overlapped Cameras FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a process for tracking the VR headset 105 using cameras with overlapped fields of view, according to one embodiment. In one embodiment, the steps of the process are performed by the VR console 110. However, in other embodiments, the steps of the process are performed by a processor within the headset 105 or by another computing device. Other embodiments may also include additional, fewer, or different steps, and may perform the steps in different orders. The VR console 110 receives image data from the cameras 120 while the VR headset 105 is located at an initial location in the environment. Using the image data, which may include one or more still frame images or video data, the VR console 110 identifies 402 features in the environment of the headset 105. The environment's features are any interest points in the environment that can be used to localize the VR headset 105 within the environment and may be relevant for the media presented by the VR console 110. Thus, the identified features may include, for example, any lines, corners, or edges, which may correspond, for example, to walls, objects, or boundaries in the environment. To identify the features, the VR console 110 may apply any of a variety of edge or corner detection algorithms to the image data received from the cameras 120. The VR console 110 may also determine objects or boundaries in the environment based on the features. For example, the VR console 110 may use a clustering or regression algorithm to determine features that are part of the same object, and store the determined features together as a representation of the object. Based on the identified features, the VR console 110 determines 404 the initial position of the headset 105 in the environment. In one embodiment, a position of the headset 105 in the environment can be represented as distances between a reference point 215 on the headset and one or more reference points in the environment, angles between the reference point 215 and the reference points in the environment, and an orientation of the headset 105 with respect to a gravitational axis. Thus, for example, the VR console 110 determines 404 the initial position based on distances between the reference point 215 and at least a subset of the identified features and stores the distances and an orientation of the VR headset 105 as the initial position of the headset. The VR console 110 also stores the coordinates representing positions of the identified features in the environment. As a user of the headset 105 views media displayed by the headset, the user may move the VR headset 105 to different locations in the environment by walking through the environment, rotating or tilting his head from the initial position of the headset, or otherwise moving the headset 105. The VR console 110 receives 406 motion data from the VR headset 105 as the headset is moved throughout the environment. When the headset 105 is moved to a new location in the environment, the VR console 110 uses the motion data to estimate 408 the new position. In one embodiment, the VR console 110 uses the motion data to determine a vector representing an estimate of the new position of the headset relative to the initial headset position. For example, the VR console 110 receives data from motion sensors 125 on the headset 105, such as an accelerometer and a gyroscope, measured by the sensors during the movement of the headset 105 from the initial position to the new position. The data from the motion sensors 125 includes directions and rates of the headset's movement, which can be used to derive information about the motion of the VR headset 105. The VR console 110 may alternatively receive motion data from other sensors, such as optical depth sensors positioned on the headset 105 or in the environment. Based on the received motion data, the VR console 110 determines a magnitude of the headset's movement and an angle between the initial position and the new position of the headset 105. In one embodiment, the VR console 110 continually tracks the movement of the VR headset 105 during use by calculating magnitudes and angles of the movement of the headset based on continuously-received motion data. The VR console 110 also tracks movement of the VR headset 105 using image data captured by the cameras 120. To track the movement of the headset 105 from the initial position to the new position, the VR console 110 receives 410 image data from the first camera 120A on the headset 105 at the new position of the headset. The image data received from the first camera includes observations of at least a subset of the identified features in the environment. Based on the image data from the first camera 120A, the VR console 110 identifies 412 a first observation of the new position of the headset 105. For example, the VR console 110 determines the distance from the new position of the headset 105 to the features in the environment, and identifies the new position of the headset 105 based on a difference between the determined distance and the distance between the features and the initial position of the headset 105. For the new position of the VR headset 105, the VR console 110 generates 414 offset values representing a difference between the location of the headset 105 determined using the image data from the first camera and the location of the headset determined using the motion data. The VR console 110 stores the location of the headset 105 determined using the image data from the first camera 120A, as well as the offset values. Similarly, the VR console 110 receives 416 image data from the second camera 120B captured at the new position of the headset. The image data from the second camera 120B includes observations of the features identified in the environment. Because a portion of the field of view of the second camera 120B overlaps a portion of the field of view of the first camera 120A, the subset of features visible in the image data captured by the second camera 120B may include some of the features visible in the image data captured by the first camera 120A. However, the subset may also include other features not visible to the first camera 120A that fall in a portion of the second camera's field of view that does not overlap the first camera's field of view. The VR console 110 uses the image data from the second camera to identify 418 a second observation of the new position of the headset 105. Like the first observation of the new position, the second observation may include a difference between a distance from the new position of the headset 105 to the features and a distance from the initial position of the headset 105 to the features. The VR console 110 also generates 420 offset values representing a difference between the location of the headset 105 determined using the image data from the second camera and the location of the headset determined using the motion data. The VR console 110 stores the offset values and the location of the headset determined using the image data from the second camera 120B. The VR console 110 determines 422 a difference between the first observation of the new position and the second observation of the new position, and uses the determined difference to improve the measurements of the environment. In one embodiment, the VR console 110 uses the difference between the observations, the offset values corresponding to each observation, and a known geometric relationship between the cameras 120 to improve the calculations of the headset's position in the environment and the position of the objects in the environment. For example, the VR console 110 may improve the accuracy of the estimated location of the headset 105 determined using the motion data by applying a function of the offsets to the features observed in the overlapping portions of the camera fields of view. The VR console 110 may additionally or alternatively use the differences between the observations and the known geometric relationship between the cameras 120 to determine sizes of objects in the environment, improving the model of the environment for more accurately determining the position of the headset 105 in the environment and improving media presentation associated with the environment. To improve the headset location and determine object sizes, the VR console 110 may use both features falling in the overlapped portions of the camera fields of view, as well as features falling in the portions of the camera fields of view that do not overlap. For features in the overlapped portions, the VR console 110 triangulates the positions of the features observed by each camera to determine the headset location and objects sizes. For features falling in the non-overlapping portions of the camera fields of view, the VR console 110 determines absolute distances between the features and the headset by estimating relative motion of the features. Because both cameras are fixed to the headset 105 with a given geometric relationship (e.g., given by a position vector from camera 120A to camera 120B), there is a known relationship between apparent velocities of the two cameras as the headset 105 is moved. If the movement of the headset 105 has non-zero angular motion, the VR console 110 computes the local velocity of the cameras 120 relative to one another by calculating a cross-product between the position vector between the cameras 120 and the rotational motion of the headset. If the movement of the headset 105 does not have angular motion, the VR console 110 computes the local velocity by determining locations of features at more than two positions of the headset 105. The VR console 110 then solves the following system of equations for scale_A and scale_B: (scaleB)*B\u2212(scaleA)*A=vc where A is a vector representing a distance between a feature and camera 120A in each of three dimensions, B is a vector representing a distance between the feature and camera 120B in each of the three dimensions, and vc is the relative local velocity of the cameras 120. The values scale_A and scale_B represent the full translational and rotational motion of the headset 105, and can be used to determine the headset location and the sizes of objects in the environment. After determining the difference between the first and second observations of the new position of the VR headset 105, the VR console 110 may identify 424 one or more additional features in the environment using the image data from the first camera 120A and\/or the second camera 120B. For example, the VR console 110 identifies features that were not visible to the cameras 120 at the initial position of the headset, but are visible at the new position. The additional features may then be used in determining positions of the headset subsequent to the new position. In one embodiment, the VR console 110 also determines features that have moved within the environment. For example, if a physical object in the environment moves as the user moves the headset 105, the VR console 110 may determine the new position of the object relative to the new position of the headset 105 after determining the position of the headset relative to static features in the environment. The VR console 110 displays 426 media to the user of the VR headset 105 based at least in part on the new position of the headset 105 in the environment and the features in the environment. The media displayed to the user may include a representation of the environment in which the headset 105 is operated, as well as virtual augmentations to the environment. For example, the VR console 110 may augment the environment by adding virtual objects or characters to the environment, as displayed to the user by the electronic display 115. As the user moves within the environment, the VR console 110 may change the displayed media. For example, if the user turns his head to the left, the VR console 110 provides media that mirrors the user's movement (e.g., displays a new portion of the environment and new virtual objects in the new portion of the environment). Alternatively, the media displayed to the user may be affected by the environment and\/or the user's movements through the environment without displaying a representation of the environment to the user. For example, the VR console 110 may display a virtual object instead of a physical object present in the environment, and display the virtual object being moved when the user moves the physical object.

The coiled wire loop is insulated and never makes any direct electrical contact with any conductors of an implanted lead or surrounding tissue. When an implanted lead is exposed to the intense RF-pulsed fields of an MRI scanner, high currents can result. It is well understood by Faraday's Law of induction and the Biot-Savart law that charges moving at an RF frequency create associated oscillating magnetic fields. For example a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner uses an RF-pulsed field, whose frequency is based on the Hydrogen Lamour Frequency and would be located approximately at 64 MHz. This means that the current (i) that is induced in one of the conductors in an implanted lead, reverses direction 64 million times per second. This means that the associated magnetic field also reverses it polarity at the same frequency, in other words this magnetic field is expanding and collapsing about the lead conductor at that same frequency. The wound inductor coil of the present invention intercepts, without making electrical contact, the expanding and collapsing magnetic field, which will induce energy\/current (i) in the coil itself. Since energy is conserved the energy in the invention's coil is due to removal of energy from the implanted lead conductor about which the coil is wound. This is typically referred to as magnetic coupling. In order for the coil to take as much energy out of the implanted lead conductors as possible, it is critical that the coil be a closed loop design. That is, multiple turns of wire, which can be in a single layer or multiple layers are wrapped about an implantable lead conductor or conductors and then the ends of the coil are connected through an impedance such that a complete current (i) loop is formed.

DESCRIPTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention generally relates to implantable medical leads. More particularly, the present invention relates to a coiled, closed-loop RF current attenuator configured to be placed about a conductor of the implantable medical lead. 2. Background of the Invention It is well known in the prior art that implanted leads, inside of a patient, can overheat during exposure to high RF intense fields, particularly those of an MRI scanner. The pulsed RF field of the MRI scanner efficiently couples to certain lengths of implanted leads, thereby inducing substantial currents. These currents can cause overheating at electrodes or at other locations along an implanted lead, thereby presenting a danger to the patient. One is referred to U.S. Pat. No. 8,244,370, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein with this reference. In particular, with reference to the background of the '370 invention, it will be better understood how MRI scanners can induce currents on implantable leads and how said currents can result in a danger to patients. One is also referred to U.S. Pat. No. 8,301,243, the contents of which are incorporated herein by this reference. The '243 patent provides further information as to how MRI scanners can present a danger to patients with implanted lead. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a closed-loop electrical circuit composed of a coiled wire loop, which is formed about an implantable lead conductor. The coiled wire loop is insulated and never makes any direct electrical contact with any conductors of an implanted lead or surrounding tissue. When an implanted lead is exposed to the intense RF-pulsed fields of an MRI scanner, high currents can result. It is well understood by Faraday's Law of induction and the Biot-Savart law that charges moving at an RF frequency create associated oscillating magnetic fields. For example a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner uses an RF-pulsed field, whose frequency is based on the Hydrogen Lamour Frequency and would be located approximately at 64 MHz. This means that the current (i) that is induced in one of the conductors in an implanted lead, reverses direction 64 million times per second. This means that the associated magnetic field also reverses it polarity at the same frequency, in other words this magnetic field is expanding and collapsing about the lead conductor at that same frequency. The wound inductor coil of the present invention intercepts, without making electrical contact, the expanding and collapsing magnetic field, which will induce energy\/current (i) in the coil itself. Since energy is conserved the energy in the invention's coil is due to removal of energy from the implanted lead conductor about which the coil is wound. This is typically referred to as magnetic coupling. In order for the coil to take as much energy out of the implanted lead conductors as possible, it is critical that the coil be a closed loop design. That is, multiple turns of wire, which can be in a single layer or multiple layers are wrapped about an implantable lead conductor or conductors and then the ends of the coil are connected through an impedance such that a complete current (i) loop is formed. It will be taught that the two ends of the closed loop coil can be (1) connected to each other, (2) connected to each other through a resistance or a discrete resistor, (3) connected to each other through a capacitance or a discrete capacitor, (4) connected to each other through a resistance in series with a capacitance or with a discrete resistor in series with a discrete capacitor, (5) connected to each other through an inductance or a discrete inductor and\/or (6) connected to each other in combinations of these previous embodiments. In one embodiment, the ends of the coil will be coupled together through a capacitance such that, the capacitance and the inductance of the closed loop coil are self-resonant at the MRI RF-pulsed frequency. This is not the same as a bandstop filter, as previously taught in U.S. Pat. No. 8,244,370 or in U.S. Pat. No. 8,301,243. In the '370 and '243 patents, indeed, there is an inductor in parallel with a capacitor, which is disposed in series with the conductor of the implanted lead. The present invention is not wired in series with any of the conductors of the implanted lead nor is there any electrical contact made between the conductors of the two constructs. In contrast, the effect of RF energy removal from the lead conductor is through magnetic mutual inductance effects otherwise known as transformer effects or coupling, wherein energy is removed from the lead conductors through mutual inductance coupling (M).

FIG. 1 illustrates various types of active implantable and external medical devices 100 that are currently in use. FIG. 1 is a wire formed diagram of a generic human body showing a number of implanted medical devices. 100A represents a family of hearing devices which can include the group of cochlear implants, piezoelectric sound bridge transducers and the like. 100B represents a variety of neurostimulators and brain stimulators. Neurostimulators are used to stimulate the Vagus nerve, for example, to treat epilepsy, obesity and depression. Brain stimulators are pacemaker-like devices and include electrodes implanted deep into the brain for sensing the onset of the seizure and also providing electrical stimulation to brain tissue to prevent the seizure from actually occurring. The lead wires associated with a deep brain stimulator are often placed using real time MRI imaging. Most commonly such lead wires are placed during real time MRI. 100C shows a cardiac pacemaker which is well-known in the art. 100D includes the family of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD's), and artificial hearts, including the recently introduced artificial heart known as the Abiocor. 100E includes an entire family of drug pumps which can be used for dispensing of insulin, chemotherapy drugs, pain medications and the like. Insulin pumps are evolving from passive devices to ones that have sensors and closed loop systems. That is, real time monitoring of blood sugar levels will occur. These devices tend to be more sensitive to EMI than passive pumps that have no sense circuitry or externally implanted lead wires. 100F includes a variety of bone growth stimulators for rapid healing of fractures. 100G includes urinary incontinence devices. 100H includes the family of pain relief spinal cord stimulators and anti-tremor stimulators. 100H also includes an entire family of other types of neurostimulators used to block pain. 100I includes a family of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) devices and also includes the family of congestive heart failure devices (CHF). This is also known in the art as cardio resynchronization therapy devices, otherwise known as CRT devices. 100J illustrates an externally worn pack. This pack could be an external insulin pump, an external drug pump, an external neurostimulator or even a ventricular assist device. 100K illustrates the insertion of an external probe or catheter. These probes can be inserted into the femoral artery, for example, or in any other number of locations in the human body. 100L illustrates one of various types of EKG\/ECG external skin electrodes which can be placed at various locations. 100M are external EEG electrodes placed on the head. FIG. 2 shows a prior art outline diagram of the human heart 102 and a cardiac pacemaker 100C. Shown are two implanted leads 104 and 106 which both have IS-1 connectors 104a, 106a at their proximal ends. Lead 104 is routed transvenously into the right atrium (RA) 108 of the heart 102. Lead 104 is a bipolar lead, meaning that it has two conductors. One of the lead conductors terminates in the distal tip electrode 104b and the other conductor terminates in the distal ring electrode 104c. Implanted lead 106 is routed into the right ventricular cavity (RV) 110. It is also bipolar, meaning that it has two conductors, one of which is connected to the distal tip electrode 106b and the other conductor is connected to the distal ring electrode 106c. This is known in the art as a dual chamber bipolar pacemaker 100C. The pacemaker 100C has a metallic housing 112 generally of titanium, stainless steel or the like. It also has a header block 114 which holds connector assembly components in accordance with ISO Standard IS-1. In this case, the header 114 has two connector cavities 116 and 118 into which the IS-1 lead proximal connectors 104a, 106a can be inserted. Generally, there would be set screws to fix the connector ring and pin electrodes firmly in place (not shown). There are leadwires 120, 120\u2032, 122, 122\u2032 routed from the connector cavities 116, 118. These four leadwires 120, 120\u2032, 122, 122\u2032 are routed to a hermetic seal 124 where the wires pass through the housing 112 in non-conductive relation. It is very important that the housing 112 of the AIMD be completely hermetic to protect sensitive electronic components, for example, those that are shown on circuit board 126. FIG. 3 illustrates a prior art unipolar lead wire 106 with a distal tip electrode 106b that contacts myocardial cells in a human heart. The proximal end of the lead 106 is connected to an active implantable medical device (AIMD) 100C, which in this case, is an exemplary cardiac pacemaker, as previously illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. In a unipolar system, lead 106 only has a single lead conductor or wire. Generally, this lead or conductor is encapsulated in a lead body, which is insulative and also provides mechanical strength properties. Sometimes, these lead conductors (not shown), are helically wound or in other cases can be straight. Some composite lead bodies have both helically wound and straight conductors. Referring to the detailed descriptions in the Villaseca references, shown disposed about the lead conductor 106 is a coil 130, which is wrapped about the lead body 106. In either of the Villaseca references their FIG. 4 illustrate a coiled wire 410 disposed about the body of an implanted lead. The following is quoted from paragraph [0030] of the Villaseca '720 reference: \u201cTurning now to FIG. 4, a coil 410 is attached to the lead 300 near the tip 330 of the lead 300. Placing the coil 410 at the distal end 310 of the lead 300 may prevent appreciable amounts of high frequency induced current 340 from traveling on the length 300. Effectively, the coil 410 acts as an electromagnetic trap, which is capable of trapping\/filtering RF signal-induced currents 340, such as currents induced by the presence of an MRI signal.\u201d Now, with further reference to the Villaseca '720 publication, the following is quoted from paragraph [0031]: \u201cTurning now to FIG. 5, an enlarged view of the distal end 310 of the lead 300 and the coil 310, is illustrated. The coil is wrapped around lead 300 near the tip 330. The coil 410 provides the function of an inductor, whose inductive properties occur at higher signal frequencies, such as 64\/128 MHz.\u201d Referring now to paragraph [0032] of the Villaseca '720 publication, it is stated: \u201cFurthermore, an insulative coating 620 that insulates the wire 610 is of dielectric material, such as an enamel coating. Due to the insulation of the coil 410, the portion of the lead 300 covered by the coil 410 is not electrically conducted to its surrounding; therefore, it does not function as an anode or an electrical return path of current into the body of a patient. However, the conductive material 610 of the coil 410 provides for electrical characteristics within the electrical path of lead 300. In other words, the conductive material 610 of the coil 410 adds capacitance and\/or inductive characteristics to the electrical path of the lead 300 in a series fashion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Referring once again to the Villaseca '720 publication, FIGS. 4 and 5 are highly instructive. As clearly stated in quotes from the Villaseca references the open wound coil 410 is electrically insulated from any of the lead conductors. In other words, this is a wrapped coil whose ends are not connected to anything. As a term of art, this is known as an open coil or an open electrical circuit. Indeed, a certain amount of energy will be coupled through the previously described expanding and contracting oscillating magnetic fields due to induced MRI RF currents along lead conductors. Reference is now made to the Villaseca '720 paragraph [0033], quoting: \u201cTurning now to FIGS. 7a-7b, equivalent electrical circuitry that result from the implementation of the coil 410 onto the lead 300, are illustrated.\u201d There are several important things to realize about the above quoted sentence. Most importantly, equivalent circuits, as used in electrical engineering, do not imply a physical circuit. The Villaseca '720 publication clearly states, as quoted above in paragraph [0032], that: \u201cDue to the insulation of the coil 410, the portion of the lead 300 covered by the coil 410 is not electrically conducted to its surrounding, therefore, it does not function as an anode or an electrical return path of current into the body of the patient.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In paragraph [0031] of the Villaseca '720 reference, it was stated: \u201cThe amount of windings of the coil 410 could be varied to effect the capacitive and inductive effects created by the coil 410.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this context, as an equivalent circuit model, the words \u201ceffect\u201d or \u201ceffects\u201d are also very important. In other words, it should not be construed that the open wound coil 410 of the Villaseca '720 reference is in any way physically in series with a lead conductor. Therefore, FIGS. 7a through 7d are significantly in error. For example, in FIG. 7a, an inductor L 710 is shown in series with the implantable lead 300. Furthermore, a resistance 720 is shown, which is very confusing because in the Villaseca '720 paragraph [0033], it is stated: \u201cThe coil 410 provides an inductor 720 in series with an equivalent resistance R 710 in the electrical path of the lead 300, which terminates at the ring tip 330.\u201d There are obvious typographical errors here in that, the coil is labeled as element L 710 and the resistor is labeled as an element 720. This is further complicated when one reviews the Villaseca '721 reference. In FIG. 7a and paragraph [0036] of this document it is stated: \u201cThe coil 410 provides an inductor L 710 with an equivalent resistance R 720 (which in one embodiment is the equivalent resistance of the coil 410) in the electrical lead path of the lead 300.\u201d This section seems to imply that the invention's coil 410 has somehow been directly, mechanically, and electrically inserted into the lead, in direct contrast with previous descriptions. These descriptions will confound even one skilled in the art of electrical engineering. It is important and fundamental to recognize that there is no known way in modern, accepted electromagnetic theory or practice to impart a series resistance in the electrical lead 300 using an external influence. In electrical engineering and physics the effects of electrical coupling is termed parasitic capacitance (a term, in fact, used by both Villaseca references) and the effects of magnetic coupling is termed parasitic inductance. Both of these effects are explained in electrical engineering as imparting imaginary impedance. There is no known art which can, without direct electrical contact, place a parasitic real impedance or a resistor in a coupled circuit. The Villaseca references, in contrast to FIG. 7a and 7b, indicate that there is no direct electrical contact between the coil 130 and the lead 106. The equivalent circuit in Villaseca's FIG. 7b becomes even further confusing in that, it shows an inductor 710 in parallel with a capacitor 730. At first glance, this would appear to be a prior art bandstop filter. One is referred to U.S. Pat. No. 7,844,319 Susil et al., which claims benefit to a provisional application No. 60\/283,725 filed on Apr. 13, 2001. FIG. 1g of the Susil reference teaches the use of bandstop filters 24 and 25 in series with a medical lead (in this case, for a probe or catheter used or inserted into human tissues). In Susil, the inductor and capacitor of bandstop filter 24 is truly designed in series with the implantable lead. It is well known by electrical engineers that at resonance an inductor in parallel with a capacitor will present a very high impedance along the length of the lead when it connected to it in series. This has the effect of preventing MRI induced currents from reaching an implanted electrode, for example, the ring electrodes 14 and 15 shown in FIG. 1g of the Susil patent. This is not the case as taught by Villaseca '720. Referring once again to Villaseca FIG. 7b, this equivalent circuit is simply incorrect. In other words, there is no bandstop filter being physically disposed in series along the length of this lead. In fact, Villaseca '720 makes it very clear that the capacitance C 730 is a parasitic capacitance of the external coil 410 not of the lead 300. One is referred to Villaseca [0036], in which it is stated: \u201cThe capacitance C 730 is generally due to the parasitic capacitance that is formed across each of the windings of the coil 410.\u201d Furthermore, in Villaseca '720 paragraph [0037] states: \u201cThe capacitance C 730 represents an equivalent capacitance of a combination of the plurality of parasitic capacitance across the linings of the coil 410. The combination of the parallel configuration of the inductor L 710 and the capacitor C 730 provides a parallel circuit that is of a higher impedance than the inductor L 710 by itself. Therefore, the circuit provided by the coil 410 provides for a broader range of frequencies in which significant high impedance at high frequencies is created near the tip 330 of the lead 300.\u201d Again, this is where Villaseca's equivalent circuits are inconsistent. Villaseca '720 never describes, shows or teaches that the coil 410, as illustrated in FIG. 4, is anything, but an open coil. As illustrated in Villaseca's FIG. 5, the two ends of the coil 410 are not connected together. Villaseca further teaches away from the idea that the ends of the coil are connected together when he describes that the capacitance C 730 of FIG. 7b, is a parasitic capacitance formed among adjacent windings of the coil. In other words, the equivalent circuit, as illustrated in FIG. 7b, wherein a bandstop filter is disposed in series along the lead conductor 300, is not a physical reality. As previously pointed out, the Susil '319 patent clearly illustrates in its FIG. 1g, the physical reality of a bandstop filter disposed in series of medical lead conductors 4 and 5. A major limitation of the Villaseca '720 publication is that the ends of the physical coil 410 are open and return currents are limited to the parasitic capacitance C formed by the inductor L. For an open wound coil such as shown in the Villaseca '720 FIGS. 4 and 5 the parasitic capacitance that appears between each of the insulated winding, will not result in a high enough loop current (i) to transfer substantial amounts of induced RF energy out of the implanted lead 300 and into the coupled structure, as described by Villaseca. By leaving open the end of the coil a large impedance exists between points A and B of FIG. 4A. When the RF currents in the lead 106 magnetically couple to the coil 130 a voltage will be induced across the length of the coil as described by Faraday's Law of Induction. Since the ends (A and B) of the coil 130 are not connected, no further current will be able to flow. The power associated with the induced effects in the coil 130 can be expressed as P=I\u00d7V where, P is power dissipated in the coil 130, I is the current induced in the coil 130, and V is the voltage induced across the coil 130. Since the current is zero no appreciable power can be present in the Villaseca invention of coil 130. PSPICE simulations will be provided herein to further prove this effect. FIGS. 7c and 7d are equivalent circuits in Villaseca '720, which are also highly misleading and inconsistent with accepted electrical engineering principals. The open wrapped coil, indeed at low frequency, would appear invisible to electrical currents. Therefore, the only equivalent circuit that the inventors herein agree with would be FIG. 7c wherein, at low frequency, the only effect along the length of the medical lead conductor 300, is its own resistance 720. In other words, this is the resistance of the lead conductor and is not affected in any way by the loosely, open wrapped coil. At low frequency, the inductive effect of the loosely, open wrapped coil, including any mutual inductance, would be trivial. However, in FIG. 7d, it is implied the equivalent circuit at high frequency is an open circuit and this is simply not true. One of the reasons for this is that the bandstop filter, as described in FIG. 7b of Villaseca '720, is not in series with the lead conductor 300. Again, one has to go back to the Susil reference to see that teaching as well as U.S. Pat. No. 8,244,370, which has priority to provisional application No. 60\/283,725 filed on Apr. 13, 2001. In other words, it has been long known that placing bandstop filters in series with medical leads would provide a very high impedance (ideally, an infinite or open circuit) at an MRI RF-pulsed frequency. The equivalent circuit of FIG. 7d is literally taken from Susil FIG. 1e where the electrodes 14 and 15 are cut or cut off from the lead conductor such that no RF currents can flow into human tissue. This is simply not possible with the open wound coil 410 of Villaseca, particularly when the return circuit is solely dependent on miniscule amounts of turn-to-turn capacitance. In the present invention, it will be taught that it is very important to wrap a coil about medical leads and have the two ends of that coil terminated in an impedance. It will also be demonstrated that the selection of that impedance is very important in order to maximize currents to the coil and thereby, transfer a maximal amount of RF energy out of the lead body and trap it in the closed loop coil of the present invention. FIG. 4A of the present invention is the electrical engineering accepted Villaseca circuit (Villaseca FIGS. 4, 5 and 6) showing the coil 130 (Villaseca 410) wrapped around the lead conductor 106. FIG. 4B is shown as an equivalent circuit and as previously noted, resistor R 720 is actually a subset of the resistance of the lead wire Rwire 721 and not induced by the open wound coil 130. FIG. 4B is reproduced using the same numbering as in the Villaseca reference. As previously described, the resistance Rwire 721 and the resistance R 720 actually refer to the same equivalent series resistance of the implanted lead conductor 330, which is described as the lead conductor 106 in the present invention. Referring once again to FIG. 4B, one can see that the inductor L is labeled as 130 (Villaseca's 410, 710). The 410 refers to the open wound coil as described in Villaseca '720 FIGS. 4 and 5 and 710 refers to the effect that the open wound coil has upon the implanted lead wire 106, which is shown in FIG. 4B as Villaseca 330. The inventors herein, agree that the open wound coil of Villaseca will have a small inductive type of affect (due to mutual inductance) on the implanted lead 330. However, this affect will be miniscule as opposed to the present invention as will be further described herein. FIG. 5A is the actual circuit of Villaseca '720 showing the inductor L 130 (410). As one can see, the two opposite ends of the inductor A and B are not connected to each other or to any other component. Nowhere in Villaseca '720 is it taught that there is an impedance element connected between points A and B. FIG. 5B is taken from Villaseca's '721 FIG. 7b equivalent circuit and is not the appropriate equivalent circuit of the effect of Villaseca's open wound coil about the lead wire will have on the lead wire 300. As previously described, it is not appropriate to break open the implanted lead wire 330 and insert a discrete inductor in parallel with a discrete capacitance C into the AIMD lead wire(s). In particular, there is no known electrical engineering principle to couple in the resistance 720 into the lead wire 300. Villaseca incorrectly states that this will present a very high impedance in series with the lead 330 (herein known as implanted lead 106). As previously described the open wound coil will not support sufficient currents to allow a large amount of power to be present in the invention's coil 130 and by conservation of energy large amounts of the energy cannot be removed from the lead 300. In addition, such bandstop filters have already been taught by Susil and the other references cited that predate Susil. FIG. 5C illustrates the actual equivalent circuit that should have been drawn by Villaseca. Shown, is an implanted lead 106 (described as element 330 in Villaseca). This lead can either be helical (coiled) or a straight filar. In either case, it is known through the Biot-Savart law that an AIMD implanted lead would have distributed inductances along its entire length shown as L1, L2 . . . Ln. Now, in any one of these locations, you could apply at any point along the lead 106 the open wound coil 130 (410 of Villaseca). There is a mutual inductance (M) indicating that the expanding and collapsing magnetic field, due to RF currents in the lead, shown as iRF. Those expanding and contracting lines of magnetic field would also cut across the wires of coil 130 (410). The mutual inductance, in this case, is quite small compared to a conventional transformer, because there are no ferromagnetic materials involved. The reason for this is because of the main static field of an MRI scanner. The 1.5 Telsa or greater static magnetic field would saturate and render such ferromagnetic materials useless for this particular application. Referring back to FIG. 5C, it will be appreciated that all along the length of the lead conductor 106, there are not only inductances L1, L2 . . . Ln, but there are also distributed resistances all along its length. It's impossible to know, from the description of Villaseca '721 whether this resistance is R 720 or R 721. One thing that is clear, for the open wound coil 410 of Villaseca, it is simply not possible to impart a real impedance (resistance) in series with the resistance of the lead conductor 106. That would be an improper equivalent circuit. It is particularly interesting to study U.S. Pat. No. 7,013,180, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, which is the patent that issued from the Villaseca publication 2003\/0144721. The inventors have gone through a lot of effort to explain how the Villaseca publications and patent do not in any way teach that the open wound coil inductor 410 has any direct connection to a lead wire. Direct quotes from the Villaseca specification make it clear that coil 410 is insulated, does have parasitic capacitance and is not electrically connected to any lead or body tissue. In this light, it is most constructive and most confusing to examine Villaseca's patent claim 1 against Villaseca's patent claim 2. In claim 1, it is clearly stated, \u201cA first coil wound about at least one of said proximal end portion.\u201d In this case, the word \u201cabout\u201d is key. This is completely consistent with Villaseca's entire spec where his coil 410 is wound about the lead body or lead connector. This is also completely inconsistent with Villaseca's claim 2, which states, \u201cA medical electrical lead comprising: a pacing tip; a connector adapted for connecting with an implantable device connector block; an electrical flow path extending between the connector end and the pacing tip; and a plurality of inductive coils, each in series with the electrical flow path; wherein, at least one of the plurality of inductive coils is adapted to filter RF signal-coupled electrical energy traveling along the flow path towards the pacing tip.\u201d The plurality of inductive coils each in series with the electrical flow path, is exactly what was taught in the Susil reference in FIG. 1f wherein, coils 24 and 25 are shown disposed physically and electrically in series with the electrical flow path. The coil of Villaseca 410 has an inductive \u201ceffect\u201d on a lead, but does not literally create a plurality of inductive coils in series with the electrical flow path. This gets even more confusing when one reads Villaseca's claim 5 as it reads on claim 2 wherein, it states, \u201cThe lead of claim 2, further comprising a capacitor in parallel with a one of the plurality of inductor coils.\u201d Villaseca never teaches or suggests a discrete capacitor. In fact, this is exactly what is taught by Susil FIG. 1g wherein, a bandstop filter is disposed as an inductor in parallel with a capacitor in series with the conductive path. In summary, claims 2 and 5 of Villaseca were already taught by Susil in U.S. Pat. No. 7,844,319 and by Halperin\/Stevenson in U.S. Pat. No. 8,244,370 (which has priority back to 2001). In addition, Villaseca's claim 1, which describes a coil about the lead, is completely inconsistent with claims 2 and 5. Villaseca seems to be claiming two completely different inventions, which is confusing to the present inventor. FIG. 6 illustrates the lead system of the present invention. Shown is an AIMD 100. Referring back to FIG. 1, AIMD 100 can be any of a number of AIMDs, as described in FIG. 1. Exemplary lead body 106 is shown. In this case, the lead is unipolar, meaning that it only contains one conductor. It will be appreciated that unipolar is shown for simplicity, but any number of AIMD implantable lead conductors are equally applicable. By way of illustration, an electrode 106 is shown inside of a human heart 102. But it will be appreciated that this could be a neurostimulator, for example, a spinal cord stimulator, a deep brain stimulator or the like. Again, refer to FIG. 1 for examples of all the different AIMD lead systems, including probes and catheters that the present invention is applicable to. A closed loop coil 200 of the present invention is shown wound around the lead conductor 106 wherein, its two ends are terminated in an impedance element Z 202. This is a major distinction from Villaseca in that, the two ends of Villaseca's coil A and B are never shown connected together or to anything else as is specifically stated in the Villaseca specification. FIG. 7 is identical to FIG. 6 except that the impedance element has been replaced by a short circuit 204. In other words, the two ends of the coil A and B are simply connected together. FIG. 8 is also very similar to FIGS. 6 and 7 except that in this case, the impedance element Z is a resistor R 206. FIG. 9 is very similar to FIGS. 6, 7 and 8 except that in this case, the impedance element is a capacitor C 208. FIG. 10 is very similar to FIGS. 6, 7, 8 and 9 except that in this case, the impedance element Z is a resistor R in series with a capacitor C 210. FIG. 10A illustrates the impedance element 211 where an inductor L placed in series with a resistor R and a capacitance C, indicating that an inductor chip can be added. It will be appreciated that an inductor chip or discrete inductor element or component could be added to any of the closed loop circuits as illustrated in FIGS. 6 through 10. This is particularly useful when the inductance of the wound inductor 200 is not very large and an improved L\/C ratio is required to better optimize the impedance of the closed loop coil of the present invention at resonance. Referring to FIGS. 6 through 10A, in every one of these embodiments, through mutual inductance, a significant amount of induced RF energy along the lead conductor 106 is transferred to the closed loop coil 200 of the present invention. In every embodiment, it is preferred that as much current (icoupled) as possible flow in this closed loop circuit comprising the coil 200 and the connecting impedance Z. This robs energy from the lead conductor 106 thereby lowering the energy present at the interface between the distal electrode 106 and body tissues, limiting the possibility of overheating and potential damage. In an embodiment, it will be appreciated that the closed loop inductor attenuating filter of the present invention, be disposed at or near the one or more distal tip electrodes 106b. The COILED, CLOSED-LOOP RF CURRENT ATTENUATOR CONFIGURED TO BE PLACED ABOUT AN IMPLANTABLE LEAD CONDUCTOR will hereinafter be referred to as the \u201cclosed loop attenuator\u201d for the sake of simplicity. It will be appreciated that this shorthand way of describing the invention is fully describing the closed loop system or circuit, including a connecting impedance, as previously described in FIGS. 6 through 10A. FIGS. 11A through 11E illustrate the closed loop attenuator of the present invention and how it can be applied to various lead systems. In FIG. 11A, it is shown that the closed loop attenuator 200, 202 can be placed anywhere along the length of a unipolar lead 106. From this point on the closed loop current attenuator of the present invention, will be referred to as a single number 205. It will be understood that the closed loop current attenuator 205 always encompasses a coil 200 wrapped around at least one AIMD lead conductor, where its two ends are terminated in an impedance element 202, which can embody any of the impedance elements previously described in FIGS. 6 through 10A. In FIG. 11B, it is shown that the closed loop attenuator 205 can be placed anywhere along the length of a biopolar lead system 104\u2032. In a bipolar lead system, there is generally a tip electrode 104b and a ring electrode 104c. This means that the lead body 104\u2032 actually has two conductors running from the AIMD, one conductor terminates at the distal tip electrode 104b and the other conductor terminates at the ring electrode 104c. It is very common for pacemaker applications that both of these conductors are spirally (helically) wound, one inside the other. A closed loop attenuator of the present invention therefore, becomes very well coupled to the lead conductors because its closely spaced turns are wound directly around the turns of the bipolar lead. Having spiral or helically wound implantable lead conductors, creates a stronger oscillating magnetic field as opposed to straight wires. Straight wires are commonly used in defibrillator applications or in neurostimulator applications. The present invention is still very effective for those, but it is even more effective when AIMD lead conductors are helically wound. FIG. 11C illustrates that the closed loop attenuator 205 of the present invention can be wound over multiple lead bodies. In this case, there are two lead bodies 104 and 106 each of which contains a unipolar conductor, which are connected to electrodes 104b, 106b at their distal ends. FIG. 11D illustrates the same system as FIG. 11C except that each of the lead bodies 104\u2032 and 106\u2032 are bipolar, meaning that each lead is associated with its own distal tip (104b, 106b) and distal ring electrode (104c, 106c). This is the system that was more thoroughly described as the dual chamber pacemaker, in FIG. 2. FIG. 11E illustrates that the closed loop attenuator 205 of the present invention can be wrapped around a bundle of leads 104\u2032 and 106\u2032 or it can be wrapped around the lead body separately. FIG. 12 illustrates that any number of the current attenuators 205 of the present invention can be placed along a lead conductor or locations, 205a, 205b . . . 205n. It is also understood that the unipolar lead illustrated in FIG. 12 could be a bipolar lead, or be a multiplicity of leads having any number of conductors. FIGS. 13 to 15 shows schematic captures of PSPICE simulation circuits. Three circuits were created and simulations were performed, which will later be plotted and compared to show how effective the closed loop attenuator 205 of the present invention is compared to Villaseca's open loop coil. FIG. 13 is a PSPICE schematic of Villaseca's circuit. The Villaseca coil 130 (described by Villaseca as coil 410) is shown adjacent to distributed inductance L 104 of the implanted lead 106. It will be appreciated through the Biot-Savart law in physics, that all conductors will have a distributed inductance along their length. For adjacent conductors, a mutual inductance M exists. Now referring to the PSPICE schematic, a voltage source is shown driving a standard 50-ohm source and 50-ohm load resistance. A 50-ohm source and load are representative of most common test equipment, such as Spectrum or Network Analyzers. In other words, this simply represents applying a network analyzer to analyze the lead system and the open wound coil of Villaseca. Referring again to FIG. 13, points A and B of Villaseca are not connected as Villaseca describes. However, one will notice in the PSPICE simulation that a 100-M\u03a9 resistance is shown connected between point A and lead conductor 106 and another 100-M\u03a9 resistance is connected between point B and lead conductor 106. The reason for this is to \u201cfool\u201d PSPICE. The PSPICE schematic and simulation software will not allow open or floating nodes. In other words, the program will not run if there is a dangling node like node A or B left unconnected or floating. The electrical design engineer \u201cfools\u201d the program by placing a very high value of resistance like 100-M\u03a9 between the elements that they wish to electrically isolate. This could have been 100-G\u03a9 or 100-T\u03a9, but the important thing is that the value be so large that it will not affect the circuit simulation result. In summary, PSPICE does not recognize an infinite resistance and simply will not run if a node is left unconnected. As will it be shown in a subsequent drawing, the plotted currents in the Villaseca coil 130 (410) will be shown in comparison to two of closed loop attenuator designs of the present invention. FIGS. 14 and 15 are PSPICE schematics of the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 10 herein. It will be appreciated that for the ideal embodiments, shown in FIGS. 7 and 9 wherein, there is no resistance, however these are ideal since some resistance is always present due to the materials used to construct the coil. The PSPICE circuit, shown in FIG. 14, has an impedance element 204,206. Element 204 represents a short circuit and 206 represents that even a short circuit will have some resistance, particularly when one includes the 1.35\u03a9 of resistance that would be the resistance of the coil of the closed loop attenuator 200. Again, 100-M\u03a9 resistors are used to \u201cfool\u201d PSPICE and to electrically isolate, except for the mutual inductance between the coil 200 and the inductor L104 of the lead 106, the closed loop attenuator 205 of the present invention from the rest of the circuit which represents the lead 106 with induced RF current (iRF). Accordingly, FIG. 14 is applicable to a short circuit, as shown in FIG. 7, or a resistance, as shown in FIG. 8 (204,206). FIG. 15 is similar to FIG. 14 and it shows the closed loop current attenuator 205 of the present invention, but in this case the circuit includes a discrete capacitance of 6.185 picofarads. This capacitance has been carefully calculated with the inductance of coil 200 to create a resonant circuit at 64 MHz. For FIGS. 13, 14, and 15 the coil of the respective inventions, 130 (Villaseca 410) and 200, is simulated as a 1.0 microHenry inductor with a PSPICE coupling factor of 0.5 to the L 104 of the lead 106 which is simulated as a 0.1 microHenry inductor. In FIG. 15, the value of the discrete capacitance has been carefully calculated to include any parasitic capacitance that is also present in coil 200. In this way, the capacitor C 208 is resonant with the inductor 200 and the MRI pulsed frequency of about 64 MHz for a 1.5T Hydrogen imaging MRI. This is not actually thought of as a bandstop filter as erroneously portrayed by Villaseca. In practice this circuit is actually an inductor in series with a capacitor. The objective of FIG. 9 to 10A is minimize the impedance of the circuit when it is at resonance. The configuration of this invention is considered a bandpass circuit as opposed to bandstop whose objective is to maximize the impedance of the circuit when it is at resonance. To describe resonance the following conventions are used: (1) the inductive reactance is designated as a +j inductor sign and (2) the capacitive reactance is designated as a \u2212j reactance sign. Resonance occurs when \u2212jXC=+jXL wherein XC is the capacitive reactance and XL is the inductive reactance. FIG. 15A gives the formula for the resonance frequency fr in Hertz wherein, the inductance is in henries and the capacitance is in farads. The values of L and C are carefully chosen, such that the resonant frequency fr will occur at the MRI RF-pulsed frequency. In other words, for a 1.5 Tesla scanner, fr would be 64 MHz. At resonance the impedance of the inductor and capacitor cancel and appear as a short circuit, allowing maximum current to flow in the loop. Another way of looking at this is maximal energy will be robbed from the implanted lead conductor when the closed loop attenuator 205 is at resonance. FIG. 16 illustrates a family of curves, which are PSPICE simulations of the schematics previously illustrated in FIGS. 13, 14 and 15. From FIG. 16 the curve with the least amplitude appears as a flat line, expect in the zoom-in window, illustrates the amount of current 212 (icoupled) that will flow through Villaseca's open circuit coil 130 (410). The current that is induced in Villaseca's open loop coil 130 (410) is illustrated in FIG. 16 as 212. Element 212 is also shown in a blown-up box showing that the current (icoupled) induced in Villaseca's coil is very small due to the coil 130 being an open circuit where end A and B of FIG. 4 are not connected and is on the order of nanoamperes. This small current is what is required to create the voltage drop across the coil 130 due to coupling with the lead inductance 104. This is a trivial amount of current (icoupe), meaning that a trivial amount of energy has been robbed, due to mutual inductance, from the implantable lead system. In comparison, curve 214 illustrates the closed loop attenuator of the present invention, with the return impedance as a short circuit or as a resistance. In this case, a resistance of 1.35 ohms is shown, generally representing the resistance of the coil 200 itself. As one can see, this induces a significantly larger coupled current 214 (icoupled), as compared to Villaseca 212, but is still small compared to the amount of current (icoupled) that can be achieved through a resonant circuit using a discrete capacitor connected between the ends of the coil A and B. Attention is drawn to curve 216 which represents the current (icoupled) induced in the coil 200 that is resonant with capacitor 208. One can see that the current (icoupled) is many orders of magnitude greater (approximately 12.5 milliamps) as compared to the nanoamps of the Villaseca open circuit design. In summary, the closed loop attenuator 205 of the present invention, when designed to be resonant with an external capacitance, creates a maximal current in coil 200 thereby transferring maximal energy out of the lead thereby, making the lead safer. In particular, when disposed at or near a distal tip electrode this has the effect of lowering the RF energy present at a distal tip electrode thereby greatly reducing the chance that it could overheat, burn or otherwise injure sensitive body tissue, such as nerves. FIG. 17 is the previously described bipolar pacemaker system of FIG. 2 now showing various locations for the closed loop attenuator 205 of the present invention. As can be seen, the closed loop attenuator can be disposed anywhere along the lead systems or even around grouped-together lead systems. There is a down side to the closed loop current attenuator 205 of the present invention in that, all of this greatly increased current flow in the closed loop, does create heat. Referring back to FIG. 15, one can see that when the current (icoupled) through coil 200 gets very large, that the current not only flows through capacitor 208 but also flows through the resistance 1.35 ohms of the coil itself. This creates an I2R loss, which is the formula for power. This power is converted from watts into heat energy, which is undesirable. Referring back to FIG. 17, it is desirable to have this benefit when the closed loop attenuator 205 is disposed near the distal electrodes so as to take away maximal induced RF energy away from them. As can be seen in FIG. 17, a desirable location for the closed loop attenuator would be along the length of the lead, in the blood stream of say, the right ventricle 110 or the right atrium 108. These are highly perfused areas, meaning that there is a lot of blood flow that would carry a lot of heat away from the closed loop attenuator of the present invention. Another acceptable location for the closed loop attenuator would be near the AIMD itself, which is generally placed in a pocket either under the skin or undemeath the pectoral muscle. Having the closed loop attenuator placed away or distant from sensitive tissue, such as myocardial tissues or nerve tissues and instead in muscle or fat, makes heating in that location far less dangerous. Maximizing heat transfer out of the closed loop attenuator of the present invention will be described in a subsequent drawing. FIG. 18 of the present invention illustrates the closed loop attenuator 205 may be embedded in its own separate housing 218 that can be slipped on to a pre-existing lead body shown as 106 (in this case, having unipolar electrode 106b). Referring back to the closed loop attenuator 205 and its housing 218, one will see that one or more suture tabs 220 are included. The suture tabs 220 allow the surgeon to place stitches\/sutures to thereby anchor the RF current attenuator assembly 205 in place. These sutures\/stitches can be placed around the lead body 106 or through body tissues or both. As can be seen, an aperture 228 is formed by the housing 218 such that the aperture 228 is disposed through a center of the coiled conductor along a longitudinal axis 230. FIG. 19 illustrates the closed loop attenuator assembly 205 as previously shown in FIG. 18 now slipped over the lead body 106. In other words, FIG. 19 shows the mating of the closed loop attenuator assembly 205 of the present invention placed onto the lead body 106. FIG. 20 illustrates that the closed loop attenuator 205 of the present invention can be designed into the lead body 106 thereby eliminating the need for a separate structure 218. Referring back to FIG. 20, it is an essential property of the present invention that the conductor that forms the coil 200, of the current attenuator, be insulated. This is very important so that the individual turns of the coil do not short to each other (called a turn-to-turn short) or form electrical connection to any other surrounding materials, such as lead conductors, body tissues or the like. FIG. 21 includes a blown-up section showing that the lead that forms the coil 200 includes a conductor 222, which is surrounded by an insulator 224, which can also be thought of as a dielectric. Furthermore, an embodiment of the present invention is when the impedance Z 202 is a capacitor and that the closed loop attenuator 205 be resonant at the MRI RF-pulsed frequency. Part of creating this resonance is to control the parasitic capacitance of the coil 200. One does this by controlling the type of insulation 224 and the thickness of the insulation 224. By controlling the type of insulation, one can control its dielectric constant and therefore, the amount of parasitic capacitance that develops. Of course, the balance of the capacitor is provided by circuit element 202, which in the preferred embodiment is a discrete capacitor. FIG. 22 illustrates the three-dimensional shape of the closed loop attenuator 205, including its coil 200 and its impedance element 202. All of the preceding drawings to FIG. 23 are actually inaccurate in that, for ease of illustration, the coils have been shown loosely wound. FIG. 23 illustrates that the actual coils that form inductor 200 would be very tightly packed. FIG. 23 illustrates one embodiment wherein, the coils were first wound in one direction, very tightly and then wound back on themselves very tightly, such that the impedance element 202 can be used to connect their two open ends (A and B). As described, element 202 can be a short or in a preferred embodiment, a small chip capacitor. Element 202 can be any of the previously described impedance elements as shown in FIGS. 6 through 10A. As can be understood by those skilled in the art, the ends A and B can be adjacent to one another as shown here or reside on opposite ends of the coil 200, as it is dependent upon the winding used to create the closed loop attenuator 205. Starting at a first coil end A, the innermost coil can proceed to be wound to the right and then the coil 200 is wound upon itself back to the left so it stops at second coil end B. The outermost portion of the wound coil 200 is a return coiled conductor portion that then allows ends A and B to be adjacent to one another. As is understood by those skilled in the art this embodiment has two windings, but three, four, five, six or any number of windings are possible. The electrical insulation that surrounds conductor 222 may be electrically insulative but highly thermally conductive. This allows the heat generated within the closed loop attenuator 205 to be readily transferred into surrounding body tissues and fluids, such that not too much temperature rise occurs. Body fluids, such as moving blood, can absorb a substantial amount of heat energy without subsequent temperature rise. However, when placed in a poorly perfused location, such as in the spinal nerve root, even a small amount of heat can result in a significant temperature rise in that poorly perfused area. In other words, location is important. Referring once again to FIG. 23, the closely wound coils of inductor 200 can be wound on a mandrel 226. Commonly available coil winders and materials now allow one to wind the coils on the mandrel 226 and then heat up the structure, such that the surrounding turns stick to each other. This allows the mandrel 226 to be removed leaving the coil structure 220 free-standing. The closed loop attenuator 205 of the present invention is particularly effective when it is disposed over an implantable lead wire that embodies helically or spirally wound coils. The use of helix or multiple spirals are very common in cardiac applications where the lead has to be highly flexible and be able to withstand. Although several embodiments have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made to each without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited, except as by the appended claims.","cpc_label":"A61N108","ipc_label":"A61N108","filing_date":"20160101","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20160707","examiner_id":"69057.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention generally relates to implantable medical leads., in the context of the novelty:  A coiled, closed-loop RF current attenuator is configured to be placed about an implantable lead conductor .

FIG. 10 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module, in accordance with certain example embodiments. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS Overview Providing local online shopping with near-term delivery presents challenges not met by single-business delivery, item category couriers, general couriers, or errand labor auction services. Among those challenges is the fulfillment of orders for items that are at least temporarily out-of-stock (or otherwise unavailable) at the primary inventory site. Given that inventory sites can be brick-and-mortar retail locations without real-time inventory reporting capability, an inventory site's stock of items as reported to a local online shopping service on a periodic, for example, daily, basis may not reflect actual item stock levels. Further, when a mobile computing device is used to interact with the local online shopping service (either through a mobile web browser or a native application), the limited user interface (UI) of the mobile computing device presents a challenge to display options for responding to out-of-stock conditions and receiving feedback. Though a more elaborate UI than that available on a mobile computing device can be presented via a desktop or laptop computing device, efficient use of vertical UI space still can be important. Experience has shown that some consumers have a negative UI experience when interaction requires more than either minimal vertical scrolling or navigation away from the current page\u2014resulting in loss of potential customers. Technical impediments exist to consumers conducting online shopping on a mobile computing device such as a smartphone. In 2014, the average new smartphone presented a diagonal screen size of less than 5\u2033\u2014including the space available for a keyboard. With such a limited UI, entering long queries and conducting extensive research on a smartphone can be cumbersome for the smartphone user. Such a small UI is not amenable to displaying rich results, for example, search results responsive to broad queries. When combined with the growing fragmented nature of consumers' interaction with smartphones, the technical challenge to presenting useful information across fragmented interactions through a relatively small UI can be substantial. By using and relying on the methods and systems described herein, embodiments of the disclosed technology can present a UI that offers item swap options to a consumer, and receives item swap feedback via the limited UI of a mobile computing device (and conserving valuable vertical UI space in desktop and laptop computing environments). As such, the systems and methods described herein may be employed to solicit consumer input using a carousel structure that makes efficient use of both horizontal and vertical UI space, and that retains the participation of consumers who would otherwise abandon the purchase process. In embodiments of the present technology, the consumer is not presented with a cumbersome UI that requires vertical scrolling beyond the point at which some consumers would abandon the purchase process when faced with the need to swap an item. Further, the UI can receive item swap preferences without redirection of the user's browser. Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, example embodiments of the present technology are described in detail. Example System Architectures Referring to FIG. 1, an example communication and processing architecture 100 for a UI for local online shopping with near-term delivery is illustrated. While each server, system, and device shown in the architecture is represented by one instance of the server, system, or device, multiple instances of each can be used. Further, while certain aspects of operation of the present technology are presented in examples related to FIG. 1 to facilitate enablement of the claimed invention, additional features of the present technology, also facilitating enablement of the claimed invention, are disclosed elsewhere herein. As depicted in FIG. 1, the architecture 100 includes network computing devices 110, 120, and 130; each of which may be configured to communicate with one another via communications network 99. In some embodiments, a user associated with a device must install an application and\/or make a feature selection to obtain the benefits of the technology described herein. Network 99 includes one or more wired or wireless telecommunications means by which network devices may exchange data. For example, the network 99 may include one or more of a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an intranet, an Internet, a storage area network (SAN), a personal area network (PAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a virtual private network (VPN), a cellular or other mobile communication network, a BLUETOOTH\u00ae wireless technology connection, a near field communication (NFC) connection, any combination thereof, and any other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates the communication of signals, data, and\/or messages. Throughout the discussion of example embodiments, it should be understood that the terms \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to text, images, audio, video, or any other form of information that can exist in a computer-based environment. Each network device can include a communication module capable of transmitting and receiving data over the network 99. For example, each network device can include a server, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a television with one or more processors embedded therein and\/or coupled thereto, a smart phone, a handheld computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or any other wired or wireless processor-driven device. In the example embodiment depicted in FIG. 1, a local online shopping with near-term delivery service may operate network computing device 130. A consumer may operate network computing device 110 and network computing device 120. The network connections illustrated are example and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers and devices can be used. Moreover, those having ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate that the network devices illustrated in FIG. 1 may have any of several other suitable computer system configurations. For example, consumer device 110 may be embodied as a smartphone or handheld computer may not include all the components described above. In such an architecture 100, an online shopping system 130 is responsive to item information requests received from a consumer via mobile computing device 110. As a continuing example, consider a consumer using a smartphone 110 to query for a specific detergent brand in an online shopping system 130, via either a web browser or a native application running on the smartphone 110\u2014in each case communicating with the shopping system 130 over network 99. The online shopping system 130 presents search results responsive to the consumer's query via mobile computing device 110 (or user computing device 120, as appropriate). The online shopping system 130 receives selection of an item for purchase and delivery, for example, from the search results, from the consumer via the mobile computing device 110. In addition, the online shopping system presents a UI to the consumer via the mobile computing device 110 to indicate items that are swappable with the selected item. The UI is presented as a carousel in a region occupying less than all the display area of the user mobile computing device 110. The carousel region displays at least one, and less than all, frames of the carousel, with each frame operable to be selected, and at least one frame displaying information regarding an item swappable for the selected item. The carousel is navigable, via consumer input from mobile user computing device 110, to display each frame in the carousel. Selection of a frame indicates to the online shopping system that the item corresponding to the frame is acceptable as a swap for the originally selected item. In example embodiments, the network computing devices and any other computing machines associated with the technology presented herein may be any type of computing machine such as, but not limited to, those discussed in more detail with respect to FIG. 10. Furthermore, any functions, applications, or modules associated with any of these computing machines, such as those described herein or any others (for example, scripts, web content, software, firmware, or hardware) associated with the technology presented herein may by any of the modules discussed in more detail with respect to FIG. 10. The computing machines discussed herein may communicate with one another, as well as with other computing machines or communication systems over one or more networks, such as network 99. The network 99 may include any type of data or communications network, including any of the network technology discussed with respect to FIG. 10. Example Processes The example methods illustrated in the following figures are described hereinafter with respect to the components of the example architecture 100 described elsewhere herein. The example methods may also be performed with other systems and in other environments. Referring to FIG. 2, and continuing to refer to FIG. 1 for context, example methods 200 to operate a UI for swappable item options are shown, in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. In such embodiments, an order including a first item identifier corresponding to a first item is received from a user computing device by an online shopping system\u2014Block 210. Consider, as a continuing example, a consumer selecting a 50 oz. bottle of Brand A Mountain Fresh Scent liquid laundry detergent from a website of an online shopping system 130 via a browser running on the consumer's smartphone 110 over communications network 99. The online shopping system can identify a set of one or more second items that are available for delivery (for example, are in know or expected to be in stock to meet the temporal aspects of the order)\u2014each second item in the set being swappable with the first item\u2014Block 220. Note that Block 220 can be performed independently from Block 210. For example, signals for each item in inventory of the online shopping system 130 can be used to determine a set of candidate swappable items. In the continuing example, the online shopping system 130 can use a rule-based system, including any rule-based machine learning system, to identify swappable items based on signals associated with both the selected product and the consumer. Such signals include item name, item size, item category, item physical dimensions, item price, whether or not the selected item is on sale, quantity of the selected item, aggregate user behavior with respect to the item or similar items, and characteristics of the consumer. The list of candidates can be winnowed, or ranked, without reference to an individual consumer. In the continuing example, the online shopping system 130 identifies the items of TABLE 1 as swappable with the selected 50 oz. bottle of Brand A Mountain Fresh Scent liquid laundry detergent. TABLE 1 FRAME REF. PRODUCT BRAND VARIANT SIZE PRICE 312b Laundry A Unscented HE 50 oz. $18.79 Detergent 312c Laundry B Alpine Scent 50 oz. $12.79 Detergent 312d Laundry A Mountain Fresh Scent 25 oz. $10.00 Detergent Laundry A Mountain Fresh Scent 2 @ 50 oz. $35.17 Detergent The online shopping system transmits, to the user computing device, instructions operable to cause the user computing device to display a carousel GUI\u2014Block 230. The carousel UI comprises a carousel region occupying less than all the display area of the user computing device and multiple frames. Each frame is sized such that at least one, and less than all, of the frames can be displayed simultaneously in the carousel region. Each frame is operable to receive selection of the frame via the user computing device. At least one frame includes content indicating an item from the set of one or more second items available for delivery. The carousel region is navigable via user input to display each frame in the multiple frames. Referring FIG. 3, while continuing to refer to prior figures for context, a carousel user interface 300 appropriate to a smartphone 110 is shown, in accordance with example embodiments of the present invention. In FIG. 3, UI 300 includes a section 302 that indicates that a \u201cSubstitutes,\u201d or swap options, UI is currently being displayed. UI section 304 includes a \u201cDETAILS\u201d hyperlink to an explanation of the swap options process. UI section 306 identifies the selected item. UI section 308 includes a timer for the swap options UI and a \u201cDONE\u201d radio button 316 selectable when the consumer has completed the swap options process for the selected item. The carousel 310 (between the dashed lines) includes carousel region 310 ABCD occupying less than all the display area of UI 300. The carousel 310 includes multiple frames 312a-312e. Each frame includes information for the item represented by the frame, and a frame selection icon, for example, 314b and 314c. FIG. 3 shows content for only the portion of each frame displayed in carousel region 310 ABCD. In FIG. 3, two frames (312b, 312c) are fully displayed, one frame (312d) is partially displayed (without displaying its selection icon), and two frames (312a, 312d) are not displayed. In the five-frame carousel 310 of FIG. 3, the two 50 oz. Brand A Mountain Fresh Scent laundry detergent identified in TABLE 1 is not presented as an item swap option. Referring to FIG. 4, while continuing to refer to prior figures for context, a carousel user interface 400 appropriate to a smartphone 110 is shown, in accordance with example embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments, selection of a frame, for example, 312b, indicates that the item corresponding to the content of the selected frame is acceptable to the user as a swap for the first item. Selection of a frame does not cause navigation of the user computing device away from a page containing the selected frame. In the continuing example, selection of frame 312b is indicated by a checkmark 414b applied by the user via the UI of the mobile computing device 110. Referring to FIG. 5, while continuing to refer to prior figures for context, a carousel user interface 500 appropriate to a smartphone 110 is shown, in accordance with example embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments, selection of a frame, for example, 312c, 1) indicates that the item corresponding to the content of the selected frame is acceptable to the user as a swap for the first item, and 2) deselects each other frame in the multiple selectable frames. In the continuing example, selection of frame 312c is indicated by a checkmark 514c applied by the user via the UI of the mobile computing device 110. Note that frame selection icon 314b is now unchecked, indicating that frame 312b was deselected when frame 312c was selected. Referring to FIG. 6, while continuing to refer to prior figures for context, a carousel user interface 600 appropriate to a smartphone 110 is shown, in accordance with example embodiments of the present invention. In such embodiments, the carousel 310 is navigable horizontally. In the continuing example, a right swipe 620 performed on the carousel region 310 ABCD of the UI 600 of the mobile computing device 110 moves frame 312a into carousel region 310 ABCD, moves each of frame 312b and 312c one frame position to the right\u2014thus moving the selection icon (not shown) for frame 312c out of the carousel region 310 ABCD. Note that frame 312d was moved entirely out of the carousel region 310 ABCD as a result of the right swipe 620. In some embodiments of the present technology, at least one frame in the multiple selectable frames comprises content indicating that none of the second items are acceptable to the user as a swap for the first item. In the continuing example, frame 312a, shown as selected using checkmark 614a, indicates that no swap is acceptable to the consumer. Referring to FIG. 7, while continuing to refer to prior figures for context, a carousel user interface 700 appropriate to a smartphone 110 is shown, in accordance with example embodiments of the present invention. In such embodiments, at least one frame in the multiple selectable frames comprises content indicating that automated selection of a swappable item is acceptable to the user. In the continuing example, the carousel region 310 ABCD of the UI 700 has received two (2) left horizontal swipes 720. UI frames 312b 312c have been moved out of the carousel region 310 ABCD to the left, UI frame 312d has been moved to the left-most frame position of the carousel region 310 ABCD, and frame 312e has been exposed to reveal a frame comprising content indicating that automated selection, \u201cCHOOSE FOR ME,\u201d of a swappable item is acceptable to the consumer. In this case, the smartphone 110 has received selection of the \u201cCHOOSE FOR ME\u201d option as indicated by the checkmark 714e. Referring to FIG. 8, while continuing to refer to prior figures for context, example methods 800 to operate a UI for swappable item options are shown, in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. In such embodiments, Block 210\u2014Block 230 are performed as described elsewhere herein. In such embodiments, selection of at least one frame comprising content indicating one second item from the set of second items available for delivery that are swappable is received via the user device\u2014Block 840. In the continuing example, after selecting the frame 312c corresponding to the 50 oz. package of Brand B Alpine Scent laundry detergent, the consumer selected the \u201cDONE\u201d radio button 316. In such embodiments, an indication that the first item is unavailable is received\u2014Block 850. In the continuing example, a courier arrives at a primary inventory site, for example, a grocery store, to fulfill the consumer's order and determines that the 50 oz. package of Brand A Mountain Fresh Scent laundry detergent is out of stock. The courier updates the online shopping system 130. Note that Block 840 and Block 850 can be performed in the opposite order. For example, the technology can solicit and receive the consumer's swap preference(s) before receiving a determination that the first item is unavailable. The online shopping system swaps the unavailable first item identifier in accordance with the received selection\u2014Block 860. In the continuing example, the online shopping system 130 swaps out the 50 oz. package of Brand A Mountain Fresh Scent laundry detergent in the order in favor of the 50 oz. package of Brand B Alpine Scent laundry detergent. The courier, or other order picker, can see this change in the order, and then continue with order fulfillment using the swapped selection. In some embodiments, the online shopping system notifies the courier or other order picker of the swap. The order picker can include an automated order picker. In some embodiments of the present technology, at least two frames in the swap options UI offer an opportunity for the consumer to select more than one swap option preference concurrently. For example, both frames 312b and 312c can be selected. In such a case, the final selection can be left to the online shopping system 130, the courier, or the manager of the inventory site. In some embodiments, such as embodiments shown in FIG. 9, an item swap options UI 900 can accept prioritized selection of item swap options. In FIG. 9, frames 312b and 312c each include three frame selection icons, {914b1, 914b2, 914b3} and {914c1, 914c2, 914c3}, respectively. The 50 oz. package of Brand B Alpine Scent laundry detergent is show selected as the first swap option by the \u201c1\u201d shown in selection icon 914c1. The 50 oz. package of Brand A Unscented HE laundry detergent is shown selected as the second swap option, to be used if both the first item and first swap option are unavailable, by the \u201c2\u201d shown in selection icon 914b2. In some embodiments, the UI 900 can accept user input of a priority number into the frame of the carousel region 310 ABCD. In some embodiments, the top selection, for example 914c1, can correspond to \u201c1\u201d, and graphically lower selections can correspond to \u201c2,\u201d etc., in order. In some embodiments, selection of a frame as the nth priority does not deselect other frames as other than the nth priority, but selection of a frame as the nth priority deselects a frame previously selected as the nth priority. In some embodiments, selection of a frame as the nth priority moves each frame selected as the nth priority and beyond down one level in priority if required to make room for the nth priority selection. In some embodiments, the selection mechanism for either one or both of the \u201cno swap\u201d and \u201cautomatic swap\u201d can be included in choosing prioritized swap options. For example, the UI 900 can accept frame 312c as swap priority 1 using 914c1, and \u201cno swap\u201d as priority 2 using a similar UI mechanism. In some embodiments, the selection mechanism for either one or both of the \u201cno swap\u201d and \u201cautomatic swap\u201d can be included in the UI outside of the carousel.

A system for automating and safe-guarding workflow in a pharmacy comprising: a management system connectable to an external database; at least one mobile device having image capture capabilities selectively connected to the management system; the management system receiving images and records from the at least one mobile device to form a storable record for the workflow; and the management system configured for at least one of selective requests including entry of override information, selective connection of process review requests, and selective initiation of face to face chats via the at least one mobile device, wherein any selective requests are included in the storable record for the workflow.","background":"<SOH> BACKGROUND <EOH>Many processes benefit from step-by-step monitoring and validation, for a wide variety of reasons. Examples include process monitoring and validation to facilitate regulatory compliance, implement quality control, monitor inventory, and to assess employee efficacy and efficiency. One process in which monitoring and validation are particularly important is in the sterile compounding of pharmaceutical products. Sterile compounding represents an important healthcare service provided to patients by pharmacies. Sterile compounded products play an important role in addressing infectious disease, pain management, gastrointestinal disorders, and other illnesses. A wide array of providers including home infusion pharmacies, in-office suites, and alternate-site infusion centers provide safe and effective treatments to millions of patients every day. Despite its critical nature, sterile compounding presents certain risks that remain a challenge for sterile compounding providers and regulators. In some cases, providers acting in violation of accepted compounding quality standards have caused death and serious injury among patients. Contaminated, defective, and sub\/super-potent compounds can become life-threatening when given to even relatively healthy patients. In light of recent events, including the New England Compounding Center disaster, in which 64 patients died and hundreds of patients were hospitalized due to a fungal meningitis outbreak linked to contaminated sterile compounds, regulators have begun to proactively adopt and enforce tighter safety and quality standards designed to prevent similar public health risks in the future. Emerging regulatory requirements present a challenge for providers, for whom the shifting standards have forced the creation of innovative solutions that balance compliance, excellence in care, and cost effectiveness. Similarly, many providers have proactively sought to raise the industry standard of practice in order to reduce liability and better understand sterile compounding processes. Improving the monitoring and process control in the pharmacy industry has been the subject of inventive activity. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,194,336 to Grant is directed to information management systems and methods that can be used with at least one pharmaceutical compounding device. The systems and methods comprise a controller coupled to the compounding device. A compounding control manager resides on the controller to receive compounding order input and generate control commands to the compounding device based, at least in part, upon the compounding order input. An order process control manager is in data communication with the compounding control manager to communicate compounding order input to the compounding control manager. The order entry process manager includes an order function for receiving entry of compounding order input through a browser-based interface. The browser-based interface can include an order entry workstation separate from the compounding device, or a network of order entry workstations separate from the compounding device, or can reside on the controller. U.S. Pat. No. 8,554,579 to Tribble et al. appears to disclose a system for preparing and managing patient-specific dose orders includes an order processing server configured to receive the patient-specific dose orders, define a queue of dose orders and distribute the dose orders to at least one dose preparation station. The dose preparation station is in bi-directional communication with the order processing server and has an interface for providing an operator with a protocol associated with each received drug order and specifying a set of steps to fill the drug order. Steps to fill the drug order are captured at the station and a display, positionable independent of the station outputs the dose order queue and metrics concerning activity at the dose preparation station. Systems for preparing patient-specific doses and a method for telepharmacy in which data captured while following the protocol are provided to a remote site for review and approval by a pharmacist. U.S. Pat. No. 8,756,124 to Sayers deals with a tracking system that may be used in various regulation-heavy industries, such as pharmaceutical, biomedical, construction, energy, heavy industry, and similar industries with large regulatory and\/or safety considerations. The systems addresses a track-and-trace solution based on unique item-level QR codes printed on product packaging and encoding unique URLs to enable granular, item-level product management. In some embodiments of the invention, the information presented to users who access these unique URLs is tailored based on product usability information provided from authorized supply chain participants, the role of the user in the supply chain, and\/or regulation required data comprising product safety data as required by regulations from a regulatory agency. Embodiments of the invention may be used for the purposes of item authentication, anti-counterfeiting measures, product recall management, and the efficient distribution of supplementary product information. U.S. Pat. No. 6,202,923 to Boyer shows a method and an automated pharmacy system to alleviate the risk posed by a queue of printed labels for prescription vials that occurs at the printer. The method and system eliminate the need for physically transferring paperwork from one site (the imaging station) to another site (the filling station). Elimination of the physical transferring step smooths the flow of the dispensing operation, and hence, improves the throughput of the automated pharmacy, and further, helps to prevent the association of the wrong paperwork with a given prescription. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20140214436 to Utech et al. is directed to system for component based aggregation of medication orders may include a processor and memory. The processor may receive display a queue that lists medication orders to be prepared by a healthcare professional, the medication orders indicating component medications that will be used to prepare the ordered medications. The processor may receive a selection of a first medication order listed in the queue, where the first medication order indicates a first component medication. The processor may determine a second medication order listed in the queue that indicates the first component medication. The processor may reorder the displayed queue such that the second medication order is listed adjacent to the first medication order. The processor may notify the healthcare professional of the second medication order, such as by displaying an indication of the second medication order separately from the queue. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20120278096 to Holness appears to disclose systems, methods and devices for prescription drug authentication and more specifically a portable hand-held device and system for prescription drug authentication to be conducted ad hoc. WIPO Publication No. WO1998050840 to King et al. shows a drug distribution system in which narcotics are tracked from the time they are delivered to the time they are administered to patients are provided in a health care facility. A locked vault having multiple compartments for accessing only through logging onto a computer software system records drugs withdrawn and by whom. The system also provides an inventory and purchase order for restocking purposes. Although known systems provide some advantages, they fail to resolve longstanding problems of validation and monitoring. Today, even some of the most robust compliance and quality assurance programs continue to rely primarily upon paper records and inefficient manual processes. Furthermore, internal standards for process execution are usually upheld only by occasional audits and retroactive review following an incident rather than a persistent, system-driven approach designed to prevent patient harm. Paper records bear only a minimal amount of information concerning the process used to compound an order which represents an additional barrier to the development of best practices. In-process checks and in-person cleanroom communication pose a contamination risk by frequently introducing and re-introducing additional personnel to controlled sterile environments. Accordingly, there is an established need for systems for electronically validating and monitoring processes in pharmaceutical preparation that streamline sterile compounding processes, improve patient care, and safeguard the public wellbeing by the implementation of advanced technologies in the sterile compounding setting. It is not intended that the present disclosure is limited in its scope to the details of construction and arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The principles of the present disclosure are capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, in describing the preferred embodiments, specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>The present disclosure is directed to a modular, data-driven workflow system that allows verification and supervision of the compounding process through automated workflow, image capture, bar code validation, and optional override processes. These features are further supported by flexible reporting schema and indefinite storage of integrated, individual product data within the corresponding patient record. Among the advantages are: standardization of the compounding process to electronically enforce best practices across a growing network of sterile compounding pharmacies; transferable records and data reports supporting compliance with requirements mandated by regulators and the US Pharmacopeia; and analysis of collected\/aggregated data concerning the compounding process for internal process improvement and to share with relevant stakeholders. The system in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure provides an integrated platform implementing system-driven process standardization in the sterile compounding, home infusion, and alternate-site infusion pharmacy practice settings. The system employs portable electronics such as high-definition cameras, tablet computers, and\/or smartphones, or other suitable devices, such as USB sensors, Bluetooth-enabled devices, or any other suitable device, along with clinical databases and desktop workstations, if desired, with each step of the compounding process to provide a comprehensive view of a pharmacy's sterile product operations in real time from the capture of an order to completion of delivery of the order. The system provides pharmacists and pharmacy technicians advanced tools to closely adhere to USP Chapter 797 and state-mandated safety and quality sterile compounding standards with the option of additional review of the process as needed or requested. The system-driven compounding process workflow produces a persistent record of each product's compounding process, which can be reviewed at any time and becomes permanently attached to a patient's record. This workflow system is based upon a modular system design allowing for comprehensive customization intended to meet evolving industry best practices and public safety mandates. Process data captured by the system is automatically consolidated into flexible reporting schemas and data warehouses that facilitate insights for internal performance improvement review, and is easily shared with industry stakeholders. The system features a modular workflow and compliance system providing a customizable workflow solution which enforces step-by-step compliance with quality assurance measures and compounding best practices at each stage of compounding. Workflows can be manually or automatically assigned to a product according to its risk level, therapy type, and\/or compounding process at the pharmacy's discretion after an order is automatically captured by the system. Furthermore, customization, user-control and site-control features allow implementation of workflows for a broad array of purposes including training, modification for environmental concerns, and special protocols for compounding-related activities such as quality testing or hand washing. For example, users can access the platform via a unique identifier which can be assigned descriptors that may indicate that certain users are in training. These users could be automatically, or at the discretion of an administrator or supervisor, identified by the system and only be able to access highly granular, stepwise workflows that require the maximum degree of recordkeeping and oversight. This system is compatible with Apple IOS products, Windows-based desktop workstations, and a web client accessible from any computer, mobile device, or other suitable device with an uninterrupted internet connection. The system is also designed so that it may be easily positioned as a cloud-based service delivered via a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model or as an add-on feature or integrated component of a third party platform, for example, a patient management software or pharmacy management system. The system also features integrated software incorporating a wide variety of low-cost technology solutions including mobile devices, such as, for example, tablet computers and wireless internet networks without the use of capital-intensive propriety hardware or server infrastructure. The system itself can be voluntarily actuated by individual users, or can be centrally controlled to require system components to be available during a specified time period or during critical process steps. Further, the system can incorporate software that accesses hardware components, such as a camera, for example, of the mobile device automatically when critical processes are reached, or which activates the hardware components selectively through the management system software when the technician and\/or pharmacist requests an operation, such as taking a snapshot, through a user interface of the system. This feature is further considered as a means to integrate temperature monitors, gravimetric devices, spectrometry devices, and other devices used in the compounding or product quality process, as needed or desired. The system is capable of incorporating advancing consumer and enterprise technology already well leveraged in other industries including manufacturing, food service, and software development. API integration allows compatibility with a wide arrangement of clinical databases, pharmacy management systems, and data warehouses. The design and infrastructure of these external integrations is likewise customizable to a provider's need. Another feature of the system is its Video Protocol\/HD Image Capture. The system's integrated software platform allows for the implementation of widely available HD image capture systems, including video recording, and video chat protocols commonly packaged with off-the-shelf technology solutions. The advancements in these areas greatly expands the flexibility and view that a pharmacist or pharmacy can command in overseeing sterile compounding operations in a cost-effective and safe manner. The system provides management access to data insights and reporting. Through proliferation of digital touch points throughout the compounding process, the system allows for deep data collection which in turn supports highly granular quality assurance and performance reporting. These reports can then be shared both as discrete documents and as persistent data streams to an identified data warehouse. For example, as an automatically populating database can be shared between a pharmacy and an electronic exchange monitored by a regulatory body, or a report can be delivered by email or via mobile application of select metrics derived from collected data. The system delivers superior outcomes, flexibility, and user experience in a cost-effective manner. Early generation electronic monitoring and supervisions systems have relied upon expensive proprietary hardware and server infrastructure that are both cost-prohibitive and disruptive to a provider's existing operations. Furthermore, these systems have relied upon narrow families of compatible hardware systems precluding the integration of next generation tools and technology that provide superior flexibility and capabilities. The system circumvents this barrier by providing broad compatibility with off-the-shelf technologies that require modest capital investment and minimal staff training with significant consideration for integration of other, future technologies that may benefit the user. In addition to supporting internal best practices and promoting patient safety, the system is designed to meet compliance requirements enforceable by regulatory authorities. For example, the United States Pharmacopeia General Chapter 797 (USP 797) outlines acceptable standards for environments, quality testing, aseptic technique, and other aspects of sterile compounding. Many regulatory authorities and quality assurance organizations draw upon USP 797 as a scientific authority for their own standards concerning sterile compounding\u2014in many cases, large sections, or the chapter as a whole, are adapted or referenced as the core of an agency's regulatory corpus. The system's capabilities allow for verification of USP 797 compliant technique and practices in a pharmacy at the product level. This includes a visual record of procedures performed, an assignment and justification for beyond use date (BUD) assignment, and verification of proper quality testing technique. Furthermore, the system provides for a process methodology that reduces the exposure of sterile products and environments to contamination by significantly reducing cleanroom\/anteroom traffic. The system's modular workflow design can be further customized to enforce granular technique execution verification including surface sterilization of products introduced to the cleanroom, routine cleaning procedures, and other important USP 797 quality measures. In the wake of recent quality failures at sterile compounding pharmacies across the United States, state agencies and regulators have risen to the occasion to better safeguard public wellbeing through stricter sterile compounding regulations and greater scrutiny of sterile compounding providers. One example of State-mandated sterile compounding regulations can be found in the Texas Administrative Code. In Texas, the Texas State Board of Pharmacy regulates sterile compounding pharmacies under the authority of the Texas Pharmacy Act and promulgated rules within the Texas Administrative Code. The recently introduced Class A-S pharmacy license applies many USP 797 requirements specifically to pharmacies in the community setting that perform sterile compounding. These new rules include a reiteration of direct pharmacist supervision requirements regarding pharmacy technicians performing delegated tasks and additional rules mandating in-process verification of sterile compounds. The system addresses both of these concerns by providing for a superior solution compared to line-of-sight supervision of controlled sterile environments through integration of video chat technology, high definition still image capture, and comprehensive process reporting. The system additionally provides for in-process check capabilities at various points of the workflow process in addition to an individualized retrospective comprehensive review. An ongoing debate regarding the jurisdiction of federal regulators over sterile compounding has produced a divided regulatory schema that gives the Food and Drug Administration regulatory authority over 305 B outsourcing facilities but not 305 A sterile compounding providers. 305 B outsourcing facilities perform compounding for physician office-use and other compounding not pursuant to a patient-specific prescription. 305 A sterile compounding providers provide sterile compounds exclusively pursuant to a patient-specific prescription. Presently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) functionally enforces USP 797 standards through adapted accreditation standards provided under CMS reimbursement eligibility requirements. Accreditation is generally performed by third-party accrediting agencies including the Accrediting Commission on Health Care and Joint Commission. These accrediting organizations generally enforce additional requirements regarding continuous performance improvement, stated methodologies for the investigation of product quality and patient dissatisfaction, and other quality-related policies and procedures. The system streamlines the review of process improvement in regards to sterile compounding and maximizes the utility of quality assurance resources. The system's reporting capabilities and data sharing protocols represent an evolution in the transparency of process records and associated patient records. The system's core features represent a robust process verification and electronic supervision platform specifically geared towards serving community sterile compounding patients and providers. The system is fully scalable, requires a modest capital investment compared to existing solutions, and is completely customizable for compatibility with a broad variety of existing sterile compounding operations. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure will become more readily apparent from the attached drawings and the detailed description of the preferred embodiments, which follow.","description":"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates generally to systems for electronically validating and monitoring multi-step processes, and more particularly, to a system for electronically validating and monitoring processes in pharmaceutical preparation.

These accrediting organizations generally enforce additional requirements regarding continuous performance improvement, stated methodologies for the investigation of product quality and patient dissatisfaction, and other quality-related policies and procedures. The system streamlines the review of process improvement in regards to sterile compounding and maximizes the utility of quality assurance resources. The system's reporting capabilities and data sharing protocols represent an evolution in the transparency of process records and associated patient records. The system's core features represent a robust process verification and electronic supervision platform specifically geared towards serving community sterile compounding patients and providers. The system is fully scalable, requires a modest capital investment compared to existing solutions, and is completely customizable for compatibility with a broad variety of existing sterile compounding operations. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure will become more readily apparent from the attached drawings and the detailed description of the preferred embodiments, which follow. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The preferred embodiments of the disclosure will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the appended drawings provided to illustrate and not to limit the disclosure, where like designations denote like elements, and in which: FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic flow diagram of an exemplary system in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure; FIG. 2 illustrates a screenshot at a step implemented by an exemplary system in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure; FIG. 3 illustrates a screenshot at a step implemented by an exemplary system in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure; FIG. 4 illustrates a screenshot at a step implemented by an exemplary system in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure; Like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views of the drawings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the described embodiments or the application and uses of the described embodiments. As used herein, the word \u201cexemplary\u201d or \u201cillustrative\u201d means \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any implementation described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d or \u201cillustrative\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. All of the implementations described below are exemplary implementations provided to enable persons skilled in the art to make or use the embodiments of the disclosure and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure, which is defined by the claims. For purposes of description herein, the terms \u201cupper\u201d, \u201clower\u201d, \u201cleft\u201d, \u201crear\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cfront\u201d, \u201cvertical\u201d, \u201chorizontal\u201d, and derivatives thereof shall relate to the disclosure as oriented in FIG. 1. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise. Shown throughout the figures, the present disclosure is directed toward a system for electronically validating and monitoring processes in pharmaceutical preparation that streamline sterile compounding processes, improve patient care, and safeguard the public wellbeing by the implementation of advanced technologies in the sterile compounding setting. The system, shown generally at 10, can be implemented in accordance with the flow diagram shown in FIG. 1. At a first step 12, the system automatically detects an order ready for compounding. This detection can be accomplished by a server process routinely scanning the external database for new prescriptions\/work orders and importing them into the system. Although no manual input of work orders is required, an order can also be manually entered, if desired. Work orders can be automatically derived from an external database, such as, for example, Complete Patient Record Plus (CPR+). The external database could be any suitable database, and any other software where order data can be routed through API to the system could be used in place of a standard external database. The system both looks for new orders, based on the automatic flow into the system at regular intervals, and also has an option to initiate an on demand flow of new orders from the external database into the system at any time. The system can setup different workflows for different therapies or for specific drugs, and has the option for a user to override the system workflow. At step 14, the system assigns a product-specific workflow to the order based on its therapy type. If needed, a pharmacist or technician may manually assign a more appropriate workflow at any time. The system places the order in the order workflow queue, and displays all relevant clinical and product data, as shown in FIG. 2. The system can operate with a number of different interfaces, based on a system preference. For example, the system can operate with a desktop client interface, a web client database, an iPad client, or any other suitable interface. A unique dashboard provides information to the pharmacist. Using the dashboard, the pharmacist can see the stage that an order is in, as well as the number of orders in queue. Further, the dashboard allows pharmacists or technicians to override the workflow. In addition, a queue can be prioritized, and priority can be highlighted such as, for example, by highlighting or using colors to signify priority. A progress indicator list gives a view that includes, for example, a green bar indicating progress of an order for each order. The different exemplary tabs of the dashboard allow orders to be grouped as incomplete, by stage, or using other suitable or desirable parameters. Step 16 illustrates the point at which the order enters the \u2018Staging\u2019 stage for collection of ingredients and supplies. Using a system-connected electronic device, the pharmacist or technician must provide, at a minimum, NDC validation, lot # validation, image capture, and quantity verification. An in-process check can be configured into the workflow process to allow pharmacist verification of selected ingredients prior to compounding. The technician can request a live video-protocol review with the pharmacist at any stage during the process. The technician can also request an in-process check at any stage and move the order to the pharmacist's queue for review if a live video session is not needed. The pharmacist can review an order at any stage, and then return the order to the technician's queue. A real-time interface with the external database is provided, so that if a printed copy of the order is not available the technician can see any additional instructions provided with the order on the external database. At step 18, the order enters the \u2018Cleanroom\u2019 stage for processing and compounding of the final product. Pharmacist or technician must use a system-connected electronic device provide NDC validation for drugs and diluents, lot # validation, and image capture (including draw volumes). The steps within the \u2018Cleanroom\u2019 stage are unique to the specific workflow implemented which in turn reflects the varying techniques involved with different therapies, products, and processes. Here, the system allows for the ready documentation and capture of problems, such as a spill, for example, that can occur during the compounding process. At step 18, using a touchscreen interface of a tablet computer such as an iPad or other electronic input device, the pharmacists and technicians in the cleanroom can perform quality assurance activities in an aseptic fashion. An example of the interface is shown in FIG. 3. It is to be understood that any desirable communication link, e.g., to the pharmacy, offices, and cleanroom, can be reached via video chat throughout the compounding process. Electronic devices such as tablet computers, or other suitable devices, allow a flexible view of the cleanroom and can be used to perform an in-process check or random aseptic technique audits. Furthermore, the electronic devices can be used to document incidents, such as spills within the cleanroom. Since devices such as tablet computers and smartphones are not tied down to a static area with heavy bulky hardware, users can document and note any occurrence by any of the following, for example, typing a note, using the zoom functions of a camera, removing the device from its mount and carrying\/positioning it to a better vantage point and\/or to engage a device function relevant to the workflow, or to employ device extensions or accessories as needed or desired, or to access any application available on a tablet or other suitable mobile device such as, for example, a smartphone or an iPad. In steps 20, 22, and 24, the pharmacist receives the completed final product in the \u2018Labeling\u2019 Report Generation' and \u2018Final Verification\u2019 stages and reviews the comprehensive report of the compounding process including notes, order data, and failed checkpoints integrated into the system record. A comprehensive report of each step of the compounding process is recorded, collected, and displayed in a persistent report of the system that can be reviewed at any time. The system is also capable of integrating and displaying relevant information from a third party database. For example, a pharmacist who would like to confirm that the diluent to compound a product is compatible would be able to use the system to call reference information or an approved formulary loaded into the platform. Pharmacists and technicians can provide notes to better explain unexpected deviations for review. An example of a report generated by the system is shown in FIG. 4. Next, at step 26 any supplies needed to package the order for delivery are assigned. Supplies can include, for example, boxes, labels, instructions, other orders shipping to the same recipient, or any other supplies needed to complete an order. The destination of the order is designated at step 28, where the order is released to supply assignment and delivery where it is assigned additional information concerning its delivery storage conditions, delivery time, and route of delivery, all of which are captured and integrated into the system. The order is also released for delivery at step 28, which is also integrated into the system. The system can integrate information from other connected devices, such as, for example, temperature controls contained in the delivery packaging, or other devices that can assure the time and delivery to the correct recipient under acceptable conditions. Delivery assignments, such as, for example the type of container label, box contents, tracking of actual delivery and temperature, shock or tilt conditions of the container, and also the recipient, and date and time received can be collected via the system and integrated into the patient record. Further, if a patient or recipient calls for the status of a delivery of an order a significant amount of time can be lost in the effort to obtain status update information regarding the order from paper records or telephonically from a third party parcel carrier. With the system of the present disclosure, the order is located efficiently in the system, and a delivery update is readily accessible, increasing the efficiency of the overall operation of the pharmacy. As shown at step 30, completed orders are archived within the system's reporting database and attached to the patient's chart. The completed order includes a pdf of all verification data that can be exported to the external database and attached to a patient chart. At step 32, process data can further be exported via a variety of formats into third party data warehouses or rendered as customized reports to be shared with internal and external stakeholders. The system has the ability to both capture images of the record and save as part of record and allow for personal, real-time guidance throughout the process. This facilitates evaluation of individual performance metrics for the individual users of the system, and can also use as a training tool. The system 10 is designed to address several deficiencies in the current standard of practice. Today, even some of the most robust compliance and quality assurance programs continue to rely primarily upon paper records and inefficient manual processes. Furthermore, internal standards for process execution are usually upheld only by occasional audits and retroactive review following an incident rather than a persistent, system-driven approach designed to prevent patient harm. Paper records bearing only a minimal amount of information concerning the process used to compound an order represents an additional barrier to the development of best practices. In-process checks and in-person cleanroom communication also pose a contamination risk by introducing and re-introducing additional personnel to the controlled sterile environments. There are many ways in which the system 10 addresses some of the major deficiencies in the current standard of practice. For example, known compounding approaches are subject to a significant margin of human error, particularly with respect to drug selection. Sound-alike and look-alike medications remain a risk when NDCs are not verified. With the system of the present disclosure, NDC and lot number validation against order data prevents mismatches. HD image and video capture allows review of all selected products. In another example, known compounding approaches present significant barriers to supervision of the workflow. A workstation\/desktop computer is usually a pharmacist's primary duty station from where a pharmacist is able to see, usually from a distance, the general activities in a cleanroom. Line-of-sight supervision remains the current standard, but is suboptimal for cleanroom supervision as most techniques require close inspection or proximity to ensure compliance. Consequently, prevailing supervision methods are an additional source of distraction and interruption and therefore error. With the system of the present disclosure, HD image and video capture allows review of compounding processes directly from the workstation. Video chat protocol allows for communication and supervision of compounding processes from the pharmacist's workstation with minimal distraction and interruption. Thus, the system facilitates remote in-process approval that enables a process to stop before a technician proceeds to the cleanroom. Furthermore, a second in-process step within the cleanroom allows a check before the compounding process is completed for a specific dose or batch of doses. All in-process checks can be mandated based on workflow or workflow step, voluntarily requested by the technician or pharmacist, or randomly prompt by the system per assigned protocol. Prescription orders under review in an in-process check are blocked from advancing further down the workflow until a pharmacist indicates approval. Pharmacists are notified of pending in-process approvals via a separate queue notification from the system dashboard. Voice and video integration further allows a pharmacist or technician to reach off-site personnel with specialized expertise or receive approval from supervisors for business-relevant issues encountered during the compounding process. In another example, known approaches provide at best a variable adherence to standards. Charts audits and spot process audits only present a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of a single point of operations. Variability in performance and processing presents a quality assurance risk. With the system of the present disclosure, system-driven workflow tasks require step-by-step compliance with best practices at all times. Granular reporting data allows for review of compounding process adherence over any requested timeframe at the individual, facility, and company level. Known approaches also present a heightened contamination risk. Increased traffic due to in-process checks and in-person communications represent an additional risk for contamination, and increased traffic to and from pharmacist workstations represent an additional risk for human error. With the system of the present disclosure, HD imaging and video capture systems significantly reduce cleanroom traffic, cleanroom crowding, and workflow interruptions throughout the day. In known approaches, pen and paper records are limited in their ability to describe actual process execution. Pen and paper records are suboptimal for proactive error detection and process improvement. Data from pen and paper records are difficult to aggregate and trend. With the system of the present disclosure, comprehensive granular reporting produced by digital touchpoints throughout the compounding process allows for previously unavailable insights into the compounding process. Since many modifications, variations, and changes in detail can be made to the described preferred embodiments of the disclosure, it is intended that all matters in the foregoing description and shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. Thus, the scope of the disclosure should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents.","cpc_label":"G06Q100633","ipc_label":"G06Q1006","filing_date":"20160101","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20161117","examiner_id":"66334.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: , in the context of the novelty:  The system employs portable electronics combinable with clinical databases and desktop computers, if desired, with each step of the compounding process for real-time delivery of a pharmacy's sterile product operations .

Moreover, methods are exemplary only and may be modified by, for example, reordering, adding, removing, and\/or altering the individual stages. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The discussion below describes embodiments of a sports device. These embodiments can take the form of a lacrosse stick, shown and described below, although other sports may have devices (e.g., hockey sticks, baseball bats, etc.) that could benefit from implementation of the concepts herein. In one implementation, the embodiments include materials that can retain and dissipate heat through phase changes, e.g., from solid to liquid, and vice versa. Suitable materials may maximize energy storage per unit volume\/mass so as to add little weight to the lacrosse stick but still maintain surfaces at temperatures for extended periods. This feature can make the lacrosse stick comfortable for the player to grasp and to handle during game play and practice. Other embodiments are within the scope of the disclosed subject matter. FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a sports device 100 that is useful for an individual to play an athletic game. This embodiment includes a body 102 with one or more parts (e.g., a handle 104 and an end effector 106). In one implementation, the sports device 100 can include a heating member 108 that is disposed in and\/or incorporated as part of the body 102. The parts 104, 106 can be configured so the individual can grasp the handle 104 to move and\/or operate the end effector 106, often to interact with a ball (or puck) during play of the game. In context of the sport of lacrosse, the body 102 can embody a lacrosse stick that a player employs to catch and throw a ball. The parts 104, 106 can embody a shaft and a head on the lacrosse stick, respectively. The head can be configured for the player to receive and carry the ball. The player grasps the shaft to catch and throw the ball from the head. At a high level, the heating member 108 can be configured to regulate temperature of the handle 104. Some configurations can store thermal energy and, in turn, dissipate the stored thermal energy in a way that sustains the operating temperature of the handle 104 within a range comfortable for a player for an extended period of time. Examples of the heating member 108 may raise the operating temperature of the handle 104 to approximately 140\u00b0 F. These examples can dissipate heat so that the operating temperature drops slowly, effectively keeping the operating temperature of the handle 104 within approximately X\u00b0 F. for at least approximately 15 min to approximately 20 min. This feature can maintain the handle 104 at temperatures that are comfortable for a player to utilize the sports device 100, e.g., as might occur in game play and\/or practice in cold weather. However, as noted herein, the heating member 108 does not require any external stimulus to maintain the temperature within the operating range for the period of time that the heating member is without power. In this way, the sports device 100 may not need to house and\/or carry any power supply on-board the body 102. FIG. 2 illustrates a schematic diagram of the sports device 100 that is configured to heat at least the handle 104. The heating member 108 may include a thermal core 110 that incorporates a material 112. The thermal core 110 may reside in the body 102 in position on the interior of the handle 104. The material 112 may comprise a composition that exhibits properties to store and release thermal energy in a manner that can maintain the operating temperature of the handle 104 for the extended period of time. This composition may undergo changes in phase, for example, as between a first phase and a second phase that is different from the first phase. The phase changes can be from solid to liquid and vice versa, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. In one implementation, the composition can absorb and store heat (e.g., latent heat and sensible heat) in response to thermal energy that causes a first phase change from the first phase to the second phase. Exemplary compositions may include \u201cphase change materials\u201d that are organic (e.g., beeswax, paraffin, fatty acids, etc.) and\/or inorganic (e.g., salt hydrates, etc.). These phase change materials can slowly release stored latent energy to the handle 104 during a second phase change from the second phase to the first phase. Phase change materials may be formulated for phase changes at a desired temperature. Exemplary temperatures may be in a range that is comfortable to humans and\/or human touch. In use, applying heat to the phase change materials in the first phase increases temperature of the phase change materials from a first temperature to a second temperature that is higher than the first temperature. The phase change materials may change from the first phase to the second phase at the second temperature. During the first phase change (e.g., melting), the phase change materials may continue to absorb heat, but without much, if any, change in temperature away the second temperature. This feature is useful to raise the temperature of the handle 104 to its preferred operating temperature, as noted above. Cooling phase change material induces a second phase change. During the second phase change (e.g. freezing and\/or solidification), the phase change material can slowly release the stored thermal energy. In the handle 104, this feature can thwart rapid cooling of the handle 104 to maintain the temperature of the handle 104 at and\/or around the operating temperature (or within the operating range) for the player to use the sports device 100 without developing uncomfortably cold hands. FIG. 3 illustrates a schematic diagram of an example of collateral components that can provide thermal energy to cause the first phase change of the material 112. These collateral components may form a heating system 114 that heats the composition at least to its melting temperature. The composition may be configured to continue to absorb large amounts energy at the melting temperature (and\/or or just above the melting temperature). As shown in FIG. 3, the heating system 114 may include a heat source 116 and a sensor 118 that couples with the sports device 100. A power supply 120 may provide an electrical stimulus (e.g., current and\/or voltage) to the heat source 116. During use, the power supply 120 may be adjusted for proportionate temperature settings on the heat source 116, e.g., low, medium, and high power supply. Examples of the sensor 118 may embody a bi-metal disc thermostat. The sensor 118 may also embody thermistors, thermocouples, and similarly situated devices that can generate a signal in response to temperature on the handle 104. These devices may affix to the handle 104, preferably in locations to avoid interfering with the player's use of the sports device 100. Adhesives and potting materials may be useful for this purpose. The heat source 116 may embody one or more resistive heaters and like devices that generate heat in response to the electrical stimulus from the power supply 120. Suitable resistive heaters may have any one of many form factors, including flat, tubular, coil, etched, or rod-like. The resistive heaters may include various materials including silicone rubber, polymide film, metal wire, metal foils, and ceramics, among others. In one implementation, the heating system 114 may include a control unit 122 to regulate this electrical stimulus. The control unit 122 may have one or more processors 124, storage memory 126, and executable instructions 128 that reside and\/or are stored on the storage memory 126. This configuration may be useful to communicate with at least the sensor 118 and the power supply 120 to regulate the electrical stimulus to the heat source 116. For example, the executable instructions 128 can embody computer programs (e.g., software, firmware, etc.) that can configure the processor 124 to turn the power supply 120 on-and-off in response to the signal from the sensor 118. In one implementation, the heating system 114 may include a switch device 129 that couples with the power supply 120 and\/or the control unit 122. The heating system 114 can apply thermal energy to melt the material 112. One or more of the components may be found on-board or off-board the body 102. This disclosure also contemplates configurations that use combinations of on-board and off-board components to apply thermal energy to the material 112. The power supply 120 may comprise a battery, for example one or more lithium ion cells and\/or some other electrical storage technology available at the time of the present writing or hereafter developed. The battery may be disposed on-board the body 102. Examples of the switching device 129 can include push button and or actuatable devices that are configured to allow the player to regulate the electrical signal from the power supply 120 to the heat source 116. Such configurations may allow for manual control of the heating system 114, although automated control via the control unit 122 may also cause the switch to actuate as necessary to regulate melting of the material 112. FIGS. 4 and 5 depict schematic diagrams for configurations of the collateral components for use with the sports device 100. FIG. 4 illustrates a first configuration that incorporates the heat source 116 on-board the sports device 100. This position allows the heating member to inject thermal energy to the material 112 by way of direct and indirect heat transfer modalities (e.g., conduction, convection, radiation, etc.). Any one of these modalities may cause the phase change (e.g., from solid to liquid) in the composition of the material 112 noted above. In one implementation, the thermal core 110 may be configured to incorporate and\/or integrate the heat source 116 into the handle 104. This configuration can place the heat source 116 in direct contact with the material 112. However, this disclosure does contemplate other positions on-board (and off-board or remote from) the handle 104 that can effectuate appropriate transfer of thermal energy to cause the phase change in the composition of the material 112. FIG. 5 depicts a second configuration that locates the heat source 116 remote from the sports device 100. In this second configuration, the heating system 114 may include a receptacle 130 that defines an opening 132. Examples of the opening 132 can receive at least part of the handle 104 to locate the thermal core 110 proximate the heating member 108. The heat source 116 can couple with the receptacle 130 such as in the form of one or more heating members 133 to inject thermal energy T into the sports device 100. In this respect, the receptacle 130 may be a box, cylinder, and\/or bag-like implement, although actually geometry may vary for the receptacle 130. These implements can accommodate one or more of the sports device 100 or thermal cores 110 as desired. This feature may be useful to maintain a plurality of sports devices 100 at comfortable temperatures ready for use by the player. For example, sports teams may benefit from the functionality of the receptacle 130 to maintain temperature of lacrosse sticks, hockey sticks, and bats for many players simultaneously. FIG. 6 illustrates a perspective view of the front of an example of the sports device 100 in exploded form. The sports device 100 embodies a lacrosse stick 134 (also, \u201cstick 134\u201d). The end effector 106 includes a head 136 with a frame 138 formed typically as a one-piece or unitary structure of moldable material (e.g., plastic). The frame 138 has a top 140, a bottom 142, and a pair of sidewalls (e.g., a first side wall 144 and a second sidewall 146). These parts collectively bound a central open region 148. The head 136 may include a netting 150 (also, \u201cstringing 150\u201d) that spans the frame 138 to cover the open region 148. The stringing 150 can comprise strings or fibers, often individually wound together or provided in a pre-formed webbing. This pre-formed webbing can form a pocket area 152 that may encompass the lower portion or half of the stringing 150 in the head 136. The pocket area 152 is configured to receive and support a ball (not shown) in the open region 148 during use of the stick 134. The head 136 can couple with the handle 104. In FIG. 6, the handle 104 can embody an elongate shaft 154 with ends (e.g., a first end 156 and a second end 158) and a longitudinal axis 160 extending therebetween. Examples of the elongate shaft 154 can form a cylinder made of metals, composites, metal alloys, plastics, and wood. The cylinder may be hollow, either fully or partially. The bottom 142 of the frame 138 may secure to the cylinder at the first end 156 using a screw and\/or fastener. A cap 162 may be configured to couple with the second end 138 to cover an opening to the cylinder. In one implementation, the sports device 100 can include a plug receptacle 164 that is disposed in the cap 162 (in the present example) or elsewhere on the elongate shaft 154. The plug receptacle 164 may be useful for configurations that mount the heat source 116 (FIG. 4) on-board the handle 104. In use, the plug receptacle 164 can be configured to conduct the electrical signal from the power supply 120 (FIG. 4) to the heat source 116 (FIG. 4). The plug receptacle 164 may also couple with the sensor 118, shown here disposed in position to monitor the operating temperature of the handle 104. Examples of the plug receptacle 164 may use any variety of connections (e.g., post-and-socket, universal serial bus, etc.). Also, although not shown, the sports device 100 may include one or more cables that connect the plug receptacle 164 with the thermal core 110 and\/or heat source 116 (FIG. 4) and\/or the sensor 118. FIG. 7 depicts a cross-section view of the sports device 100 in assembled form taken at line 7-7 of FIG. 6. The thermal core 110 is in position in the elongate shaft 154. For reference, the sports device 100 is configured with the heat source 116 on-board the handle 104. This configuration may locate the heat source 116 at or proximate the longitudinal axis 160. The elongate shaft 154 can have a peripheral wall 166 that circumscribes the longitudinal axis 160 to form the cylinder. For hollow cylinders, the peripheral wall 166 can have both an outer surface 168 and an inner surface 170 that bounds an interior cavity 172. Form factors for the cross-section for the peripheral wall 166 may be octagonal, as shown. However, other form factors (e.g., rectangular, annular, elliptical, hexagonal, etc.) may also find use for the handle 104 in certain sports. The sports device 100 may also include a coating 171 that is disposed on the outer surface 168, covering the elongate shaft 154 in whole or in part. Examples of the coating 171 may include materials to improve perception of warmth and\/or to provide insulation and\/or thermal conductivity to direct a warm sensation to the player's hands. These materials may comprise nylon powders and thermoplastic compositions, although many compositions may be useful for this purpose. In one example, the coating 171 may comprise thermochromic paint or like compositions that can provide a visual indication of temperature and\/or temperature changes on the elongate shaft 154. FIGS. 8 and 9 depict the cross-section view of FIG. 7 of the sports device 100 to illustrate other locations for the heat source 116. In FIG. 8, the heat source 116 can be arranged integrally and\/or monolithically with the peripheral wall 166. This arrangement may utilize one or more resistive members 173 that extend variously along elongate shaft 154. The resistive members 173 may be embedded into the material of the peripheral wall 166. In FIG. 9, the resistive members 173 can couple with the inner surface 168 using adhesives and\/or potting materials, although other fastening techniques may be suitable, whether known or developed after the present writing. FIGS. 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 depict the cross-section view of FIG. 7 with the sports device 100 in assembled form. These diagrams illustrate several configurations for the thermal core 110 to facilitate the change in temperature of the outer surface 168. For reference, the sports device 100 is configured with the heat source 116 on-board the handle 104 and disposed at or proximate the longitudinal axis 160. In FIG. 10, the thermal core 110 forms a matrix 174 with a structure 175 that creates a plurality of cells 176. The structure 175 can be configured with conductive materials (e.g., metals, conductive plastics, etc.) so as to conduct thermal energy from the material 112 to the peripheral wall 166. This property of the structure 175 can also increase penetration of thermal energy into the material 112 to facilitate efficient melting of the material 112. Such configurations can extend along the longitudinal axis 160 to varying lengths relative to the length of the shaft 154. Examples of the structure 175 can create the cells 176 to effectively compartmentalize the material 112. FIGS. 11 and 12 show other configurations for the structure 175. In FIG. 11, the configuration comprises a thermally-conductive foam, either closed cell or open celled. Such foams may be configured with pockets 177 that can entrain and\/or trap the material 112. The pockets 177 can hold material 112, with the structure 175 of the foam operating to conduct thermal energy from the material 112 to the peripheral wall 166. In FIG. 12, the structure 175 can include impregnated members 178 that populate the volume of material 112. The impregnated members 178 may comprise graphite particles and\/or carbon fibers, although other materials that are thermally conductive may be useful to retain and transfer of thermal energy to the peripheral wall 166. FIGS. 13 and 14 show a configuration for the structure 175 that can also facilitate transfer of thermal energy from the material 112 to the peripheral wall 166. In these configurations, the sports device 100 can include one or more heat transfer members 180 that interact with the material 112. The heat transfer members 180 may embody thin, thermally conductive elements that are configured to conduct thermal energy from the material 112 to the elongate shaft 154. The elements may couple with the peripheral wall 166, extending generally toward the longitudinal axis 160. These elements may integrate with the peripheral wall 166, as a unitary and\/or monolithic unit. In one implementation, the elements may form a separate unit that can insert into the elongate shaft 154 to contact the peripheral wall 166. Examples of the elements (or, \u201cfins\u201d) may extend along the longitudinal axis 160 the length of the thermal core 110, although this disclosure contemplates geometry for the fins that extend substantially (e.g., at least 90%) the length of the elongate shaft 154. In FIG. 14, the sports device 100 can include a peripheral chamber 181 to retain the material 112 proximate the peripheral wall 166 of the elongate shaft 154. The peripheral chamber 181 can extend along the longitudinal axis 160. In one implementation, the heat transfer members 180 may couple the centrally-located heat source 116 with the chamber 181. Other implementations may make use of one or more of the peripherally located resistive members 173 (in FIGS. 8 and 9) to facilitate heat transfer to the material 112 in the peripheral chamber 181. FIGS. 15 and 16 depict a cross-section of the sports device 100 taken at line 15,16-15,16 of FIG. 6. Several members including the head 136, the cap 162, and the plug member 164 are removed for clarity. For reference, the sports device 100 is configured with the heat source 116 on-board the handle 104 and disposed at or proximate the longitudinal axis 160. In FIG. 15, the sports device 100 can include a heated compartment (e.g., a first compartment 182) that corresponds with a heated portion 184 of the elongate shaft 154. The first compartment 182 can include a first pair of wall members (e.g., a first wall member 186 and a second wall member 188). Materials for the wall members 186, 188 may vary as necessary to comport with the structure of the elongate shaft 154. Epoxy may be useful to effectively \u201cplug\u201d the ends of the first compartment 182. In one implementation, the wall members 186, 188 can couple with the peripheral wall 166 to form a seal that circumscribes the longitudinal axis 160. This seal can be configured to retain liquid in the compartment 182. In the example of FIG. 16, the sports device 100 includes a second compartment 190 with a second pair of wall members (e.g., a third wall member 192 and a fourth wall member 194). The location of the wall members 186, 188, 192, 194 relative to one another in the elongate shaft 154 can define a volume for the compartments 182, 190. In use, the material 112 resides in the compartments 182, 190, either alone or as part of the matrix 174 for the thermal core 110 discussed above. However, it is also possible to have the material 112 in the intermediary compartment (between wall members 192, 194). When used alone, it may be preferable to use an amount of the material 112 that is equal to and\/or fills at least 95% or more of the volume of the compartments 182, 188 in its liquid phase. This amount can be useful to reduce flowing and\/or sloshing of the material 112 in its liquid phase inside of the elongate shaft 154 during use by the player. The volume of the compartments 182, 190 may depend on the position of the wall members 186, 188, 192, 190. The members 186, 188 reside proximate the ends 156, 158 of the elongate shaft 154. This position can maximize the volume the compartment 182 (as shown in FIG. 14) so as to makes the volume of the first compartment 182 substantially the same as the volume of the interior cavity 172 of the elongate shaft 154. Some implementations can allow the members 186, 188 to be set longitudinally inwardly from the ends 156, 158 for purposes of construction and\/or ease of manufacturability as necessary. As shown in FIG. 15, the members 192, 194 can be interposed between the members 186, 188. This configuration makes the volume of each compartment 182, 190 less than the volume of the interior cavity 172. The total volume of the compartments 182, 190 may be substantially equal to the volume of the interior cavity 172, as desired. The heated portion 184 may correspond with an area of the outer surface of the elongate shaft 154 that changes temperature in response to discharge of thermal energy from the material 112 (and\/or the thermal core 110, generally). This heated area may extend in various directions on the elongate shaft 154 including longitudinally (along the longitudinal axis 160) and radially (circumscribing the longitudinal axis 160). It may be advantageous to heat all and\/or only a portion of the outer surface area of the shaft 154. These heated portions may correspond, for example, with specific locations on the handle 106 that the player is most often to grasp while using the lacrosse stick 134. FIG. 17 depicts the cross-section of FIGS. 15 and 16 to illustrate an example of the thermal core 110. This example can include an outer casing 196 that can form one or more of the compartments 182, 190 in the elongate shaft 154. Examples of the outer casing 196 may form a cylinder that encloses the material 112 therein. This cylinder may slidably insert into the interior cavity 172 to locate in the elongate shaft 154 to form the heated portion 184. The cylinder may couple with the elongate shaft 154 using fasteners (e.g., screws, bolts, etc.), although other techniques (e.g., welds, adhesives, potting, etc.) that are known and\/or developed after the present writing may be suited as well. In one implementation, the cylinder may be configured to remove from the elongate shaft 154. This feature may benefit applications in which another one of the thermal core 110 can be separately heated (or \u201ccharged\u201d) and rapidly secured into the elongate shaft 154 by the player to heat (and\/or maintain) the handle 104 at a temperature that is comfortable to the touch. FIG. 18 depicts a flow diagram for an exemplary embodiment of a method for heating a sports device. The method 200 can include, at stage 202, configuring the elongate shaft to retain a liquid, at stage 204, disposing a phase change material in the elongate shaft, and, at stage 206, thermally coupling the phase change material and the elongate shaft so as to allow thermal energy from the phase change material to conduct to the elongate shaft. In one implementation, the method 200 may include one or more stages for locating a heater in the phase change material and coupling the heater to a plug member that is configured to receive an electrical signal to operate the heater. The method 200 may also include one or more stages for forming one or more heat transfer member in the elongate shaft, wherein the heat transfer members are thermally coupled to the elongate shaft. The stages also include disposing a conductive matrix in the elongate shaft and disposing the phase change materials in the conductive matrix. In one implementation, the method 200 may include one or more stage for forming one or more compartments in the elongate shaft, wherein the phase change material is disposed in the one or more compartments. The embodiments herein may incorporate elements and features, one or more of the elements and features being interchangeable and\/or combinable in various combinations, examples of which may include a system for heating a sports device, the system comprising a (i) a lacrosse stick comprising an elongate shaft having a peripheral wall forming an interior cavity and a phase change material disposed in the interior cavity and (ii) a heating system thermally coupled with the phase change material to cause the material to change from a first phase to a second phase. In one embodiment, the heating system can comprise a heating member disposed in the interior cavity of the elongate shaft and in thermal contact with the phase change material. In one embodiment, the heating system can comprise a heating member disposed remote from the elongate shaft, wherein the heating member is configured to transmit thermal energy to melt the phase change material. In view of the foregoing, the embodiments described herein afford players with a sports device, like a lacrosse stick, that is favorable for use in cold weather. These embodiments may use a phase change material to maintain the operating temperature of a part of the sports device (e.g., the shaft of the lacrosse stick) for an extended period of time. This phase change material may be useful because it can store and dissipate thermal energy in a way that can allow the embodiments to achieve comfortable temperatures on the sports device without the need to operate heaters during game play. As used herein, an element or function recited in the singular and proceeded with the word \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d should be understood as not excluding plural said elements or functions, unless such exclusion is explicitly recited. Furthermore, references to \u201cone embodiment\u201d of the claimed invention should not be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.

In a typical arrangement, an anode immersed in an anolyte and a cathode immersed in a catholyte are separated by a membrane, generally an ion exchange membrane. An oxidation reaction takes place at the anode and a reduction reaction takes place at the cathode. For example, with the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide is reduced to formate and formic acid at the cathode and oxygen is evolved from water at the anode. In some applications, carbon dioxide is introduced into a catholyte compartment through a porous cathode which porous cathode comprises a cathodic catalyst adapted to reduce carbon dioxide to formate and formic acid. Cathodic and anodic catalysts play important roles in determining what reactions occur at the cathode and at the anode, respectively, as well as the electrolytic efficiency of such reactions. Efficiency is typically measured as Faradaic Efficiency (FE) and is the efficiency with which electrons (charge) are transferred. That is, the percent of the total current that passes through the electrochemical cell that is used to produce the desired product (e.g., formate). In addition, it is desirable to achieve high current density in stable, long-term use. Tin-based cathodic catalysts, which generally exist as tin, tin oxide (II) (SnO), and tin oxide (IV) (SnO 2 ) (collectively, SnO X ), have been shown to give good results in the selective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate and formic acid. In addition to selectivity to formate and formic acid, desirable characteristics of such tin-based cathodic catalysts include high surface area of the catalyst on the cathode, physical and mechanical stability, high FE, and high and stable current density during operation. Finally, while catalyst activity can be unpredictable and is highly dependent upon structure, morphology, and electrolysis conditions, other post-transition metals such as lead and indium may also be candidates.","summary":"<SOH> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Electrochemical electrodes comprising tin-based catalysts, method of making, and method of use are disclosed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Preparation of Sn\u2014C Catalyst Particles Catalyst particles of nano-sized tin deposited on carbon powders (Sn\u2014C) were prepared using the procedure shown in Table 1 below. TABLE 1 (1) mix predetermined amounts of deionized water and ethylene glycol; (2) add predetermined amounts of tin chloride (IV) and ethylene glycol and ultrasonicate (e.g., ten minutes); (3) add a predetermined amount of carbon black and ultrasonicate (e.g., 30 minutes); (4) reflux the mixture at a predetermined temperature (e.g., 196 deg. C.) for a predetermined time (e.g., three hours) while stirring; (5) allow the mixture to cool to room temperature; (6) vacuum filter the solution through a 0.2 micron (\u03bcm) membrane; (7) immerse the membrane with the cake into 50 ml isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and ultrasonicate (e.g., ten minutes) until all black powder is removed; (8) heat black powder\/IPA mixture to evaporate the IPA; (9) scrape out resulting black powder; 10) calculate final weight percent SnOX {[(final weight Sn-C catalyst powder) \u2212 (initial weight carbon black powder)]\/final weight Sn-C catalyst powder} * 100 In the above procedure, the ethylene glycol acts as a solvent for the tin chloride and also as a refluxing agent. Importantly, however, ethylene glycol also acts as a reducing agent for tin. The tin used in the procedure is tin chloride (IV), but ethylene glycol reduces the tin during the refluxing process so that by the end of the process, ethylene glycol reduces the tin to tin (II) (SnO). The carbon black used was Vulcan\u00ae XC72 (Cabot Corp., Boston, Mass.) having a nominal particle size of 1 micron. Typical surface area is about 250 m2\/gram. Other suitable carbon-based support materials include carbon nanowires and carbon nanotubes.

C. for four hours, cooled, and filtered to obtain the Sn\u2014C particles (Sn\u2014C-1). Electrodes were prepared using a modification of the electrode preparation protocol outlined herein below in Table 6. The significant difference in the modified electrode preparation protocol was that no binder was used to adhere the Sn\u2014C-1 particles to the electrode substrate [i.e., carbon fiber paper (CFP)]. This allowed measurement of the performance of the catalyst particles themselves in terms of FE (%) as a function of applied cathode voltage without the possible complex effects due to the presence of a binder. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that without a binder to adhere the Sn\u2014C-1 particles to the CFP substrate, the current density [i (mA\/cm2)] may decrease continuously with Sn\u2014C-1 particles being washed away in the cell. For whatever current is noted, however, the FE (%) can be calculated. Thus, the FE (%) so obtained may be compared with that observed where solid Sn or tin-electroplated CFP electrodes are tested (i.e., 70-90% FE). As shown in FIG. 1, at total cell voltages between 3.35 and 3.95 (\u2212V), the resulting catalyst exhibited low current densities. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that in the absence of a binder to hold the particles to the CFP substrate, the particles did not adhere well. However, as shown in FIG. 2, at the chosen cell voltage range, FE is well-maintained. Sn\u2014C Experiment 2 (Sn\u2014C-2) Using the procedure shown in Table 1, Sn\u2014C particles were prepared using the ingredients and recipe shown in Table 3 below. TABLE 3 Compound Amount Tin Chloride (IV) 0.84 g Ethylene Glycol 200 ml Deionized Water 2 ml1 Carbon Black 0.60 g 11% of ethylene glycol volume The mixture was refluxed at 196 deg. C. for three hours, cooled, and filtered to obtain the Sn\u2014C-2 particles (Sn\u2014C-2). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for the resulting Sn\u2014C-2 particles are shown in FIGS. 4-9. Tin-based crystallites of about 5 nm are distributed on the carbon support. The percent tin-based material, comprising SnOX, was about 22 weight percent. Sn\u2014C Experiment 3 (Sn\u2014C-3) Using the procedure shown in Table 1, Sn\u2014C particles were prepared using the ingredients recipe shown in Table 4 below. TABLE 4 Compound Amount Tin Chloride (IV) 0.84 g Ethylene Glycol 200 ml Deionized Water 2 ml Carbon Black 0.20 g The mixture was refluxed at 196 deg. C. for three hours, cooled, and filtered to obtain Sn\u2014C particles (Sn\u2014C-3). Using less carbon, by proportion, than Sn\u2014C Experiment 2 (Sn\u2014C-2), the percent tin-based material was about 30 weight percent. TEM images for the resulting Sn\u2014C-3 particles are shown in FIGS. 10-11. Tin-based crystallites of about 5 nm are distributed on the carbon support. Sn\u2014C Experiment 4 (Sn\u2014C-4) Using the procedure shown in Table 1 and the recipe shown in Table 4, an effort was made to increase the size of the tin-based nano deposits on the carbon support to the range of 10 nm. Such size variation is dependent upon such factors as the time of hydrothermal processing, the water:ethylene glycol ratio, and the concentration of tin chloride. The procedure was the same as that for Experiment 3, except that the time of hydrothermal processing was six hours, instead of three. The results, shown below in Table 5, were disappointing, however, as the resulting catalytic electrodes exhibited very low FE (i.e., 33 to 60 percent). TABLE 5 Current Formate Time Cell Potential Density Current Density FE (hrs) (\u2212V) [i (mA\/cm2)] [i (mA\/cm2)] (%) 0 3.75 106.0 33.4 31.6 1 3.75 100.5 59.5 59.2 3 3.75 9805 51.6 52.4 24.5 3.75 92.0 40.2 43.7 Electrode Preparation Electrodes were prepared based upon Sn\u2014C-3 particles prepared according to Sn\u2014C Experiment 3 above. A porous and electrically conductive electrode substrate was used which comprised carbon fiber paper (CFP). The CFP used in these experiments was TORAY\u00ae Carbon Paper 120 which had a thickness of about 350 microns and a porosity of about 80 percent. The CFP microstructure consists of carbon fibers about 7-10 microns in diameter and are held together with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder. A catalyst ink comprising Sn\u2014C-3 particles was prepared using a sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based fluoropolymer-copolymer (e.g., Nafion\u00ae). As supplied, the Nafion\u00ae binder was a 5 percent w\/w solution in aliphatic alcohols, principally isopropyl, and water, from Sigma Aldrich. This solution was further diluted with water to form a solution with a binder concentration of about 2 mg\/ml. Requisite amounts of this diluted solution was used to produce electrodes with a binder concentration between 0.03 percent w\/w and 5 percent w\/w of catalyst loading. The electrodes were prepared according to the procedure shown in Table 6 below. TABLE 6 (1) prepare a catalyst ink mix by ultrasonicating predetermined amounts of catalyst powder (e.g., 0.02 g) prepared as above, isopropyl alcohol (e.g., 100 ml), and a requisite amount of a solution containing sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based fluoropolymer-copolymer binder (e.g., Nafion \u00ae) to provide the desired binder loading for a period of time (e.g., 30 minutes); (2) prepare an electrode substrate from a section of carbon fiber paper (CFP); (3) spray catalyst ink uniformly onto the CFP until just wet and immediately place sprayed electrode onto hot plate until dry (e.g., few seconds)1; (4) repeat (3) until desired coating weight is achieved; (5) calculate coating weight per unit area: (coating weight)\/(geometric area of electrode) 1Attempts to apply large amounts of ink in one coating may result in Sn\u2014C particle \u201cclumps\u201d which inhibit catalytic effectiveness. Best results are obtained if thick coatings as well as low catalysts loadings are avoided. Thicker coatings may crack and fall away from the substrate surface, particularly due to physical abrasion caused by flow-through carbon dioxide. Low loading, on the other hand, may not be sufficient to cover the entire substrate surface which a resulting loss of efficiency. Experimental catalyst loadings ranged from 0.45-4.5 mg\/cm2 with varying binder concentrations of 0.03-5 weight percent. Catalyst loadings are calculated as shown in Table 6. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that excess binder produces an undesirable overload of the binder onto the Sn\u2014C particles which effectively blocks the surface area of the Sn\u2014C particles available for catalyst activity. Too little binder may reduce the ability of the Sn\u2014C particles to adhere to the CFP substrate surface. To study the operational effects of the various electrodes as cathodes, it was necessary to obtain measurements of the cathode voltage. Since the cathode voltage cannot be directly applied, continuous, single-pass experiments were conducted where applied cell voltage was monitored and controlled such that the resulting cathode voltage was kept as close a possible to a predetermined value using the following formula: VAPPLIED-TOTAL-CELL=VCATHODE+IR+VANODE, (1) where VANODE=anode voltage at the prevailing current density, i (mA\/cm2) and IR=cell internal resistance or ohmic potential drop in the solution at the prevailing current density, i (mA\/cm2). Experiments were performed to determine IR and VANODE so that VCATHODE could be calculated from Eq. (1). A general schematic of the apparatus used is shown in FIG. 3. A three-compartment electrochemical reactor 350 is shown in which a three-compartment container 12 encloses an anolyte compartment 18, an anode 14, and, during operation, anolyte 24 contained within the anolyte compartment 18; a membrane 22; a catholyte compartment 20, a porous cathode 16 as described herein, and, during operation, catholyte compartment mixture 26 contained within the catholyte compartment 20; and a gas compartment 28, the gas compartment 28 containing, during operation, CO2 gas 30. The membrane 22 separates the anolyte compartment 18 and the catholyte compartment 20 and the porous cathode 16 separates the catholyte compartment from the gas compartment 28. Also during operation, an anolyte feed 36 introduces anolyte 24 into the anolyte compartment 18, an anolyte withdrawal 44 removes anolyte 24 as well as other anode reaction products, a catholyte feed 34 introduces catholyte 25 into the catholyte compartment 20, a catholyte compartment mixture withdrawal 42 removes catholyte compartment mixture 26, and a CO2 gas feed 32 introduces CO2 gas 30 into the gas compartment 28. During operation, the CO2 gas 30 in the gas compartment 28, under a pressure differential across the porous cathode 16, is distributed (indicated by arrows 40 and flows through the porous cathode 16 and into the catholyte mixture 26. To obtain IR and VANODE, two experiments were performed with reference electrode probes extended into the cathode and anode chambers. The potential difference between the probes on either side of a membrane (e.g., Nafion\u00ae) was measured and the potential difference between the cathode and the probe in the respective chamber was also measured. An Ag\u2014AgCl reference electrode was inserted from the side into the cathode chamber and a Cu\u2014CuSO4 reference electrode was inserted into the anode chamber. With reference to FIG. 3, Test Protocol 1 was performed using a Sn-electroplated CFP cathode, 2M KCl catholyte, and 0.5M H2SO4+0.5M K2SO4 anolyte. Test Protocol 2 was performed using a nano-Sn particle-based cathode (1.8 mg\/cm2); the catholyte and anolyte were identical to Test Protocol 1. The anode comprised a Ti substrate coated with a IrO2. Two runs were made of each set of test conditions. For the two test protocols of two runs each, FIG. 12 shows Current Density i (mA\/cm2) v. VANODE (VSCE). FIG. 13 shows Current Density i (mA\/cm2) v. IR (V or VSCE) [ohmic loss (V or VSCE)]. After the tests, since VAPPLIED-TOTAL-CELL was measured directly, VCATHODE was obtained using Eq. (1). Although shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, Test Protocol 2 results were not used in the calculations as there was a large loss in current densities. While not wishing to be bound by an particular theory, this large loss in current densities may have been caused by degradation of the particle-coated cathode, perhaps due, in part, to mechanical abrasion from the reference electrode. Post-experiment reference probe measurements versus SCE in saturated KCl are shown in Table 7 below, which indicates very little degradation over time. TABLE 7 Probe Type Before (mV) After (mV) Ag\u2014AgCl \u221242 \u221228 Cu\u2014CuSO4 72 50 Table 8 shows the results of a series of experiments performed with Sn\u2014C-3 cathode electrodes made according to Experiment 3 above. Catalyst loading was 1.8 mg\/cm2 at 30 weight percent SnOX on CFP substrate. In all experiments, the catholyte was 2M KCl at 9-11 ml\/min. saturated with carbon dioxide. The anolyte was H2SO4+K2SO4 at 55-65 ml\/min. The carbon dioxide flowrate was about 100 ml\/min. The anode comprised a mixed metal oxide anodic catalyst (IrO2) on a Ti substrate.

FIG. 14 shows iTOTAL (mA\/cm2), FE (%), and VCATHODE v. Time (hrs.). One could conclude, from FIG. 14 that, with time, the cathode voltage (VCATHODE) must be increased to maintain the same current density (iTOTAL). Notably, at about t=115 hours, VCATHODE is about the same as VCATHODE at t=20, but there is about a 15 percent loss in iTOTAL, and an 18.5 percent loss in FE. A more abrupt loss in current density (iTOTAL) occurs at about t=120 hours. A comparison of associated TEM images shown in FIGS. 15-18 shows a possible loss of Sn\u2014C-3 particles with time from the CFP support surface. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, physical abrasion could cause this loss, which may be reduced by adjusting binder content. On the other hand, such loss could be due to the higher applied VCATHODE. (Compare, Sn\u2014C-3 Electrode Experiments S2 and S3, using lower VCATHODE.) FIG. 14 also indicates a sharp rise in VCATHODE as well as iTOTAL from t=0 up to about t=20 hours, possible due, in part, to some preconditioning effects. Sn\u2014C-3 Electrode Experiment S2 Turning now to FIG. 19, VCATHODE is in the range of \u22121.65 to \u22121.72 VSCE with the majority of the experiment at VCATHODE\u2266\u22121.70 VSCE. As seen in FIG. 8, a large drop in total current density, iTOTAL, of about 25-40 percent is observed between t=25 hours and t=100 hours and then remains constant from about t=100 hours to about t=200 hours. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the fluctuations in VCATHODE and FE in the last 100 hours may have been caused by poor adhesion of the particles to the CFP substrate. Turning now to related FIGS. 20-23, the TEM images show no loss in Sn\u2014C particle density for used versus unused. Thus, applying VCATHODE of about \u22121.7 VSCE for about 200 hours did not appear to lead to a loss of Sn\u2014C particles from the CFP support. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the overall loss of total current density, iTOTAL may be attributable to the loss of Sn\u2014C particles due to lack of adhering which may be corrected with improved binder content. (Compare, Electrode Experiment S3.) Sn\u2014C-3 Electrode Experiment S3 In Sn\u2014C-3 Electrode Experiment S3, the binder content was increased to 1 percent in an effort to reduce Sn\u2014C particle loss from the CFP substrate. (Compare, Sn\u2014C-3 Electrode Experiment S2.) In addition, cathode potential, VCATHODE is held at \u22121.66 VSCE to avoid Sn\u2014C particle loss. (Compare Sn\u2014C-3 Electrode Experiment 51, FIGS. 14 and 15-18.) The results of Sn\u2014C-3 Electrode Experiment S3 are shown in FIGS. 24 and 25-28. Loss in total current, iTOTAL over 240 hours was 10 percent and FE remained fairly constant at about 70 percent. Looking at FIGS. 25-28, there seems to be no apparent loss in total Sn\u2014C-3 particles. (Compare, Sn\u2014C-3 Electrode Experiment 51, FIGS. 14 and 15-18 at higher VCATHODE.) Still looking at FIGS. 25-28, there does appear to be some agglomeration and possible breaking up of Sn\u2014C-3 particles. Total Sn\u2014C-3 loss seems negligible, however, thus allowing for the use of such electrodes for longer times at lower applied VCATHODE.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to medical devices for the human stomach and other passages and more particularly an artificial sphincter and a suspended balloon. 2. Description of the Problem A sphincter is a anatomical structure that typically partially or totally closes off a passage in the human body but opens to allow passages of substances. In particular, there is a sphincter where the esophagus enters the stomach, a sphincter where the lower end of the stomach enters the small intestine, a sphincter to the lower end of the colon (anus) and a sphincter below the urinary bladder. Medical conditions can cause any of these sphincters to partially or totally fail. When the sphincter between the esophagus and stomach fails, highly acid liquid and material can reflux back up into the esophagus causing pain and possible damage to the esophagus.

Application Ser. No. 13\/624,948 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to medical devices for the human stomach and other passages and more particularly an artificial sphincter and a suspended balloon. 2. Description of the Problem A sphincter is a anatomical structure that typically partially or totally closes off a passage in the human body but opens to allow passages of substances. In particular, there is a sphincter where the esophagus enters the stomach, a sphincter where the lower end of the stomach enters the small intestine, a sphincter to the lower end of the colon (anus) and a sphincter below the urinary bladder. Medical conditions can cause any of these sphincters to partially or totally fail. When the sphincter between the esophagus and stomach fails, highly acid liquid and material can reflux back up into the esophagus causing pain and possible damage to the esophagus. When the pyloric sphincter between the stomach and the small intestine fails, food material enters the small intestine before it is in the proper state of digestion. When the anus fails or partially fails, the patient needs to use bags and other means to control unwanted excretion, and failure or weakness of the urinary sphincter causes incontinence. It would be advantageous to have an artificial sphincter that could be implanted in the proper location by a general surgeon using transabdominal surgery or gastroscopy assisted by conventional gastroscopy or surgery. Obesity is a persistent problem in the U.S. and other developed countries. In some cases, it can be controlled by dieting; however, in other cases more invasive medical procedures are needed. For cases where obesity is caused mainly by overeating, It would be advantageous to have a medical device that could be implanted in the human stomach that would take up space and cause the patient to feel full and stop eating sooner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a system of medical devices that can be implanted in the human body using transabdominal endoscopic surgery to repair failing sphincters and to prevent obesity. A stainless steel or other medical grade metal or polymer non-magnetic spring covered with silicon or other long-term tissue friendly plastic tubing can be installed in place of a natural sphincter by tunneling through a non-functional natural sphincter and pulling the artificial sphincter into the tunnel to form a ring. The device can be tied on the end with suture to form a permanent structure. Without pressure, the device will be continuously closed; however, it will open under natural pressure on it just as a natural sphincter. A intragastric suspended balloon can be sutured into the stomach to cut appetite. The balloon can be roughly the shape of a pepper and take up room in the stomach without closing it off. DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES Attention is now directed to several drawings that illustrate features of the present invention: FIG. 1 is a prior art (educational) schematic drawing of a human stomach. FIG. 2A shows the artificial sphincter of the present invention installed in the esophagus\/ FIG. 2B shows a close-up view of the installation. FIG. 3 shows the artificial sphincter laid out flat. FIG. 4 shows the artificial sphincter in its installed position ready to be tied. FIG. 5 shows the intragastric suspended balloon in its installed position. Several drawings and illustrations have been presented to aid in understanding the present invention. The scope of the present invention is not limited to what is shown in the figures. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention relates to a system of devices that can be installed using endoscopic surgery. In particular, an artificial sphincter can be installed into any natural sphincter, and an intragastric suspended balloon can be installed in the stomach. FIG. 1 shows the anatomy of the human stomach. The esophagus feeds through a natural sphincter into the cardal orifice of the stomach. At the lower end of the stomach contents leave the stomach for the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter. FIG. 2A shows installation of the ring-shaped artificial sphincter 3 of the present invention at the bottom of the esophagus 2 in a tunnel made by the surgeon. The wall of the stomach 1 is shown for reference. FIG. 2B shows a close-up of the installation. It can be seen that sits in the tunneled-out natural sphincter and will function by opening and closing directly as pressure from food descending the esophagus. Without pressure, the device will be continuously closed and prevent gastroesphagal reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus. FIG. 3 shows the artificial sphincter 3 laid out flat before installation. A coiled spring 6 runs the length of the device through a tube 5. A string 4 also can attached to each end of the spring 6 and the tube 5 and can be pre-threaded through into device (or the surgeon can thread the device after implantation). The device is covered with silicon tubing 5 or other long term tissue-friendly polymer. The tubing 5 should be fairly tight-fitting and match the diameter of the spring 6. The spring 6 can be made of non-magnetic stainless steel or other medical grade metal or plastic that will expand from adequate pressure from above or from below. This allows food to enter the stomach from the esophagus during normal eating and for food to exit the stomach during vomiting. The spring 6 is placed in the plastic tubing 5. After the artificial sphincter is placed into the tunnel made by the surgeon, non-absorbable thread 4 should be tied form a tight ring. Embodiments of the invention can also be supplied with the thread pre-installed. The implantation procedure can be performed by a general surgeon using transabdominal gastroscopy with the assistance of conventional gastroscopy if needed. The surgeon first performs tunneling through the non-functional natural sphincter and then pulls the artificial sphincter into the tunnel. The device can be threaded (or supplied with threads), pulled into a ring, and tied off. FIG. 4 shows the device of FIG. 3 in a ring configuration. FIG. 5 shows an intragastric suspended balloon for obesity treatment. It is known in the art to place intragastric balloons in the stomach. They have a problem however. Since they typically float freely, they can sometimes produce symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. The balloon of the present system is shaped and fixed in place in a particular way. The balloon should occupy about \u2154 of the stomach space more or less, and be constructed in the shape of the stomach with the proximal end 20 round and bigger than the distal end gradually tapering down with the distal end 23 into the atrium. The final size of the installed balloon can be controlled by the amount of fluid-normal saline the surgeon injects to inflate the balloon. The proximal end should have a minimum of four non reabsorbed sutures 22 placed around the larger diameter of the proximal end 20. This suture should be attached to the cardia distally from the gasto-esophageal junction with a free length of 1.5 to 2.0 inches. These ties keep the balloon in an adequate position and will not produce gastric obstructive symptoms. With this embodiment of the invention, the patient feels full much sooner than otherwise. Installation of the balloon should be performed by a general surgeon with transabdominal gastroscopy with the assistance of conventional gastroscopy if necessary. The balloon has an inflation port 21 that can be inflated through the esophagus or through transabdominal gastroscopy after suturing. The balloon is typically inflated with saline liquid. Any inflating technique that causes the balloon to maintain its shape is within the scope of the present invention. Evectional removal can be performed by deflating the balloon, cutting the sutures and pulling the balloon out via the esophagus. Several descriptions and illustrations have been presented to aid in understanding the present invention. One with skill in the art will realize that numerous changes, variations and additions may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Each of these changes and variations is within the scope of the present invention.","cpc_label":"A61F5003","ipc_label":"A61F500","filing_date":"20160102","patent_issue_date":"20180227","date_published":"20160804","examiner_id":"99614.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention relates to medical devices for the human stomach and other passages and more particularly an artificial sphincter and a suspended balloon., in the context of the novelty:  A system of medical devices implantable in the human body using transabdominal gastroscopy surgery to repair failing sphincters and to prevent obesity .

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS For a more complete understanding of the present application, the objects and advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is an embodiment of a network of data processing systems in which the illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented; FIG. 2 is an embodiment of a data processing system in which the illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented; FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an embodiment of a data processing system for authentication of phone caller identity in which illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented; FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a decryption key derivation for authentication of caller identity in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure; FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a data communication between a calling telephone unit and a called telephone unit for authentication of caller identity in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure; FIG. 6 is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a method for authentication of caller identity in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure; and FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating another embodiment of a method for authentication of caller identity in accordance with the present disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method, system and computer program product for authentication of phone caller identity. For example, in some embodiments, the method and technique includes: responsive to initiation of a telephone call by a caller from a first telephone unit to a second telephone unit, retrieving an identification object comprising identification information corresponding to the caller; encrypting the identification object using an encryption key stored on the first telephone unit; and transmitting, as part of the telephone call, the encrypted caller identification object to a telephone network destined for the second telephone unit. Thus, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, a calling party encrypts an identification object having information corresponding to an identity of the calling party and transmits the encrypted identification information to the called party as part of the telephone call (e.g., inserted into the body of the session initiation protocol (SIP) invitation). The receiving or called party may decrypt the received identification object using a decryption key previously received from the calling party or received from a third party certificate authority (e.g., a telephone service provider). The decrypted result may then be evaluated to determine the authenticity of the identity of the calling party. For example, if the decrypted result is scrambled or illegible, the authentication logic on the called telephone unit may return an error or other notice of failure of caller identity authentication. The receiving or called party may then reject the call, if desired. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present disclosure may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present disclosure may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.

With reference now to the Figures and in particular with reference to FIGS. 1-2, exemplary diagrams of data processing environments are provided in which illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented. It should be appreciated that FIGS. 1-2 are only exemplary and are not intended to assert or imply any limitation with regard to the environments in which different embodiments may be implemented. Many modifications to the depicted environments may be made. FIG. 1 is a pictorial representation of a network of data processing systems in which illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented. Network data processing system 100 is a network of computers and\/or computing or data processing devices in which the illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented. Network data processing system 100 contains network 130, which is the medium used to provide communications links between various devices and computers connected together within network data processing system 100. Network 130 may include connections, such as wire, wireless communication links, or fiber optic cables. In some embodiments, server 140 and server 150 connect to network 130 along with data store 160. Server 140 and server 150 may be, for example, IBM\u00ae Power Systems\u2122 servers. In addition, clients 110 and 120 connect to network 130. Clients 110 and 120 may be, for example, personal computers or network computers. In the depicted example, server 140 provides data and\/or services such as, but not limited to, data files, operating system images, and applications to clients 110 and 120. Network data processing system 100 may include additional servers, clients, and other devices. In the depicted example, network data processing system 100 is the Internet with network 130 representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, consisting of thousands of commercial, governmental, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course, network data processing system 100 also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a telephone switching infrastructure, etc. FIG. 1 is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation for the different illustrative embodiments. FIG. 2 is an embodiment of a data processing system 200 such as, but not limited to, client 110 and\/or server 140 in which an embodiment of a system for authenticating an identity of a telephone caller according to the present disclosure may be implemented. In this embodiment, data processing system 200 includes a bus or communications fabric 202, which provides communications between processor unit 204, memory 206, persistent storage 208, communications unit 210, input\/output (I\/O) unit 212, and display 214. Processor unit 204 serves to execute instructions for software that may be loaded into memory 206. Processor unit 204 may be a set of one or more processors or may be a multi-processor core, depending on the particular implementation. Further, processor unit 204 may be implemented using one or more heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example, processor unit 204 may be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type. In some embodiments, memory 206 may be a random access memory or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile storage device. Persistent storage 208 may take various forms depending on the particular implementation. For example, persistent storage 208 may contain one or more components or devices. Persistent storage 208 may be a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the above. The media used by persistent storage 208 also may be removable such as, but not limited to, a removable hard drive. Communications unit 210 provides for communications with other data processing systems or devices. In these examples, communications unit 210 is a network interface card. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network interface adapters. Communications unit 210 may provide communications through the use of either or both physical and wireless communications links. Input\/output unit 212 enables input and output of data with other devices that may be connected to data processing system 200. In some embodiments, input\/output unit 212 may provide a connection for user input through a keyboard and mouse. Further, input\/output unit 212 may send output to a printer. Display 214 provides a mechanism to display information to a user. Instructions for the operating system and applications or programs are located on persistent storage 208. These instructions may be loaded into memory 206 for execution by processor unit 204. The processes of the different embodiments may be performed by processor unit 204 using computer implemented instructions, which may be located in a memory, such as memory 206. These instructions are referred to as program code, computer usable program code, or computer readable program code that may be read and executed by a processor in processor unit 204. The program code in the different embodiments may be embodied on different physical or tangible computer readable media, such as memory 206 or persistent storage 208. Program code 216 is located in a functional form on computer readable media 218 that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system 200 for execution by processor unit 204. Program code 216 and computer readable media 218 form computer program product 220 in these examples. In one example, computer readable media 218 may be in a tangible form, such as, for example, an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage 208 for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage 208. In a tangible form, computer readable media 218 also may take the form of a persistent storage, such as a hard drive, a thumb drive, or a flash memory that is connected to data processing system 200. The tangible form of computer readable media 218 is also referred to as computer recordable storage media. In some instances, computer readable media 218 may not be removable. Alternatively, program code 216 may be transferred to data processing system 200 from computer readable media 218 through a communications link to communications unit 210 and\/or through a connection to input\/output unit 212. The communications link and\/or the connection may be physical or wireless in the illustrative examples. The different components illustrated for data processing system 200 are not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments may be implemented. The different illustrative embodiments may be implemented in a data processing system including components in addition to or in place of those illustrated for data processing system 200. Other components shown in FIG. 2 can be varied from the illustrative examples shown. For example, a storage device in data processing system 200 is any hardware apparatus that may store data. Memory 206, persistent storage 208, and computer readable media 218 are examples of storage devices in a tangible form. FIG. 3 is an illustrative embodiment of a system 300 for authenticating an identity of a calling party or telephone caller. As mentioned above, although some telephone systems enable caller identification (caller ID) information to be transmitted to a called party, there may be situations where caller ID information is unavailable or blocked. Additionally, a calling party may have the ability to create and transmit false or misleading information to a called party (e.g., as part of the caller ID information or as a separate transmitted element of the call). System 300 enables authentication of caller identity. System 300 may be implemented on data processing systems or platforms such as, but not limited to, servers 140 and\/or 150, clients 110 and\/or 120, or at other data processing system locations (e.g., on telephone or mobile\/wireless units). For example, in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, system 300 comprises a certificate of authority 302 and having one or more processor units 304 and a memory 306. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, memory 306 comprises a registration module 308 and account data 310. Registration module 308 is used to register a telephone unit 312 and\/or a user\/owner of telephone unit 312 to enable an identity of a caller or user of telephone unit 312 to be authenticated by a called or receiving telephone unit. In some embodiments, certificate authority 302 may comprise a telephone service provider; however, it should be understood that in some embodiments, certificate authority 302 may comprise an entity other than a telephone service provider. Registration module 308 may be implemented in any suitable manner using known techniques that may be hardware-based, software-based, or some combination of both. For example, registration module 308 may comprise software, logic and\/or executable code for performing various functions as described herein (e.g., residing as software and\/or an algorithm running on a processor unit, hardware logic residing in a processor or other type of logic chip, centralized in a single integrated circuit or distributed among different chips in a data processing system). In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, registration module 308 includes a cryptographic module 320 for performing various functions and\/or operations corresponding to registering telephone unit 312 for caller authentication. For example, in some embodiments, cryptographic module 320 is used to generate a set of encryption\/decryption keys corresponding to the registered telephone unit to enable a caller identification object associated with the registered telephone unit to be encrypted with a respective encryption key and decrypted by a called telephone unit with the respective decryption key. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, account data 310 comprises information associated with each registered telephone unit for which encryption and decryption keys have been generated. For example, in some embodiments, each user or owner 324 of a particular telephone unit may be assigned or have associated therewith a particular telephone number 326. For the particular user 324 and\/or telephone number 326, cryptographic module 320 is used to generate an asymmetric key pair comprising an encryption key 328 and a decryption key 330. As will be described in further detail below, in connection with an outgoing telephone call by a telephone unit, encryption key 328 is used to encrypt an identification object corresponding to the caller\/user of the telephone unit, and decryption key 330 is used to decrypt an encrypted identification object received as part of a telephone call from another telephone unit. The registration of telephone unit 312 with certificate authority 302 and\/or the communication of encryption\/decryption keys 328\/330 may be performed over a communication network 332 such as, but not limited to, the Internet, a telephone switching network, or other type of communication network. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, telephone unit 312 includes one or more processor units 340 and a memory 342. In the illustrated embodiment, memory 342 includes a cryptographic module 350, authentication logic 352, and an identification object 354. Identification object 354 may comprise any type of object having personally identifiable information corresponding to a user\/owner of telephone unit 312. For example, identification object 354 may comprise a text object (e.g., a vCard or other type of text file) including a name or other identifying information corresponding to the user (calling party) of telephone unit 312, a digital image of the user, or other type of information uniquely identifying the user to enable another telephone unit (called party) to authenticate the identity of the calling party. Cryptographic module 350 is used to encrypt identification object 354 to enable the encrypted identification object 354 to be transmitted over a telephone switch network to a receiving telephone unit. Authentication logic 352 may be used to interface with certificate authority 302 to enable registration of telephone unit 312 with certificate of authority 302 and\/or obtain\/receive encryption\/decryption keys from the certificate of authority 302. Authentication logic 352 may also be used to analyze and\/or otherwise verify an identification object (e.g., after decryption) received from another telephone unit. Cryptographic module 350 and\/or authentication logic 352 may be implemented in any suitable manner using known techniques that may be hardware-based, software-based, or some combination of both. For example, cryptographic module 350 and\/or authentication logic 352 may comprise software, logic and\/or executable code for performing various functions as described herein (e.g., residing as software and\/or an algorithm running on a processor unit, hardware logic residing in a processor or other type of logic chip, centralized in a single integrated circuit or distributed among different chips in a data processing system). In the illustrated embodiment, memory 342 also includes encryption\/decryption data 360 comprising an encryption key 362 and, if obtained by telephone unit 312, one or more decryption keys 364 corresponding to other telephone units. Encryption key 362 comprises the encryption key generated by certificate of authority 302 and assigned to telephone unit 312 (e.g., encryption key 328 corresponding to a particular telephone unit). In the illustrated embodiment, each telephone number 370 corresponding to another telephone unit is associated with and\/or otherwise related to a particular decryption key 372 for decrypting an encrypted identification object received from a telephone unit corresponding to the particular telephone number 370. The decryption key 372 may be obtained by telephone unit 312 from the certificate of authority 302 or directly from another telephone unit. In operation, a user\/owner or other entity may register telephone unit 312 with certificate of authority 302 (e.g., upon initiation of telephone service with a service provider or at another time) to enable the generation of encryption key 328 to be used by telephone unit 312 to encrypt identification object 354 and the generation of decryption key 330 to be used by other telephone units to decrypt an encrypted identification object received from telephone unit 312. The encryption key 328 associated with the particular telephone number 326 assigned to telephone unit 312 (e.g., a telephone number stored on a subscriber identity module (SIM) card of telephone unit 312) may be obtained from certificate of authority 302 and entered\/stored manually in telephone unit 312 (e.g., as encryption key 362) or obtained\/received electronically via network 332 from certificate of authority 302. In some embodiments, only encryption key 328\/362 is received by telephone unit 312 from certificate of authority 302 while decryption key 330 associated with telephone unit 312 may be obtained by other telephone units directly from certificate of authority 302. In other embodiments, decryption key 334 telephone unit 312 may also be obtained by telephone unit 312 from certificate of authority 302 and stored on telephone unit 312 to facilitate the transmittal of decryption key 332 to other telephone units to thereafter enable such other telephone units to decrypt an encrypted identification object 354 received from telephone unit 312. For example, in some embodiments, a user\/owner of telephone unit 312 may provide a user\/owner of another telephone unit with its decryption key 330 by oral communication to enable another user\/owner of a telephone unit to enter\/store decryption key 330 in their telephone unit (e.g., by entering a code into the receiving party's telephone unit using a keypad or other input device). In some embodiments, telephone unit 312 may be configured to automatically transmit the decryption key 330 associated with telephone unit 312 to another telephone unit (e.g., in response to a user\/owner of telephone unit 312 inputting a transmit request or other code such that telephone unit 312 automatically transmits decryption key 330 over a telephone switch network to the receiving telephone unit, such as in the form of dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals). The receiving telephone unit may be configured to prepare to accept a particular series of DTMF signals as the decryption key 330 corresponding to the communicating telephone unit 312 and store decryption key 330 as corresponding to the decryption key for telephone unit 312. In response to initiation of a telephone call by telephone unit 312, authentication logic 352 may cause cryptographic module 350 to encrypt identification object 354 using encryption key 362 and transmit the encrypted identification object 354 to a receiving telephone unit as part of the initiated telephone call (e.g., inserted into the body of the session initiation protocol (SIP) invitation). At the receiving telephone unit, authentication logic 352 may identify the telephone number 370 of the initiating telephone unit 312 (e.g., via caller ID information) and determine\/identify the decryption key 372 associated with the calling telephone unit 312 to enable decryption of the received encrypted identification object 354. The receiving telephone unit decrypts the encrypted identification object 354 and authentication logic 352 on the receiving telephone unit may be used to verify and\/or authenticate the identity of the user\/owner of the calling telephone unit 312 (e.g., by evaluating the legibility of the decrypted identification object 354 or by otherwise displaying to a user\/owner of the receiving telephone unit the result of the decrypted identification object 354 to thereby enable the user\/owner of the receiving telephone unit to evaluate the decrypted result). FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating derivation of a decryption key 330 in response to receipt of a telephone call from another telephone unit including an encrypted identification object. In some embodiments, certificate of authority 302 may generate a decryption code 402 that is used in combination with a particular telephone number 326 to form decryption key 330 corresponding to a calling telephone unit. For example, in some embodiments, decryption code 402 may comprise an alphanumeric string that is combined with a numeric string corresponding to a particular telephone number 326 of the calling telephone unit to form decryption key 330 that is then used to decrypt a received encrypted identification object from the calling telephone unit. In some embodiments, the telephone number 326 of the calling telephone unit may be derived from caller identification information that enables identification of the telephone number of the telephone unit initiating the telephone call. The receiving telephone unit may then access a relational database (e.g., decryption keys 364) to identify a particular decryption code 402 associated with the caller telephone number 326. FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating authentication of phone caller identity in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In the illustrated embodiment, telephone unit 3121 is initiating a telephone call to a telephone unit 3122. For illustrative purposes, telephone unit 3121 may correspond to a user 3240 and have assigned thereto telephone number 3260 (FIG. 3). Telephone unit 3121 registered with certificate of authority 302 and was assigned encryption key 3280 and decryption key 3300. At least encryption key 3280 is stored on telephone unit 3121 (in some embodiments, decryption key 3300 may also be stored on telephone unit 3121). Telephone unit 3122 may also have registered with certificate of authority 302 and had assigned thereto for a user 3241 a telephone number 3261 along with an encryption key 3281 and a decryption key 3311. At least encryption key 3281 is stored on telephone unit 3122 (in some embodiments, decryption key 3301 may also be stored on telephone unit 3122). During a previous telephone communication exchange between telephone units 3121 and 3122, telephone unit 3121 may have transmitted to telephone unit 3122 its decryption key 3300. In some embodiments, telephone unit 3122 may have received decryption key 3300 directly from certificate authority 302. Telephone unit 3122 stores therein decryption key 3300 as corresponding to the telephone number 3260. In operation, telephone unit 3121 initiates a telephone call to telephone unit 3122, and as part of the initiated telephone call, retrieves its identification object 354 and encrypts identification object 354 with encryption key 3280. Telephone unit 3122 transmits the encrypted identification object 354 to a telephone switch network 500 destined to telephone unit 3122. Telephone unit 3122 receives the encrypted identification object 354 along with caller identification information (e.g., telephone number 3260 corresponding to telephone unit 3121). Authentication logic 352 on telephone unit 3122 determines and\/or identifies the decryption key corresponding to telephone number 3260 (e.g., decryption key 3300) and decrypts the received encrypted identification object 354 using cryptographic module 350. As indicated above, in some embodiments, decryption key 3300 may be formed based on a combination of telephone number 3260 and a particular decryption code 402 assigned to telephone number 3260. Authentication logic 352 on telephone unit 3122 evaluates and\/or otherwise displays the result of the decryption to authenticate the calling party of telephone unit 3121. As discussed above, telephone unit 3122 may have stored thereon a plurality of correlated telephone numbers and decryption keys corresponding to a plurality of other telephone units such that an encrypted identification object received from any such other telephone unit may be decrypted using a corresponding decryption key. The decryption keys corresponding to such other telephone units may have been obtained directly from certificate authority 302 or directly from the other telephone units. For example, as described above, during a previous communication exchange between telephone unit 3121 and telephone unit 3122, a user\/owner of telephone unit 3121 may have initiated a transmittal of its decryption key 3300 to telephone unit 3122 by inputting a particular code or request input (e.g., inputting a passcode, pin or other input into a keypad of telephone unit 3121). A user\/owner of telephone unit 3122 may have initiated a process on telephone unit 3122 to receive, accept, assign and store on telephone unit 3122 the received decryption key 3300 as corresponding to telephone number 3260, thereby enabling subsequently received encrypted identification objects 354 from telephone unit 3121 to be decrypted and the identity of the caller authenticated. FIG. 6 a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a method for authentication of phone caller identity. The method begins at block 602, where telephone unit 312 is registered with certificate authority 302. At block 604, certificate authority 302 generates encryption key 328 and decryption key 330 for the registered telephone unit 312. At block 606, telephone unit 312 receives and stores therein an encryption key 328. At block 608, telephone unit 312 receives and stores therein decryption key 330. At block 610, identification object 354 is generated containing personally identifiable information corresponding to a caller\/owner of telephone unit 312. At block 612, telephone unit 312 initiates a call to another telephone unit. At block 614, authentication logic 352 retrieves identification object 354 and encrypts identification object 354 with encryption key 328. At block 616, telephone unit 312 transmits the encrypted identification object 354 to the telephone switch network 502 destined for the called telephone unit. FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating another embodiment of a method for authentication of phone caller identity. The method begins at block 702, where a telephone unit (e.g., telephone 3122) obtains and\/or retrieves a decryption key 330 and\/or decryption code 402 for a desired or particular telephone unit (e.g., for telephone unit 3121). At block 704, a call is received from another telephone unit (e.g., a call is received by telephone unit 3122 from telephone unit 3121). At block 706, the telephone unit receives an encrypted identification object 354 from the calling telephone unit (e.g., telephone unit 3122 receives an encrypted identification object 354 from telephone unit 3121). At block 708, the telephone unit determines and\/or otherwise identifies the decryption key\/code corresponding to the calling telephone unit (e.g., determines and\/or otherwise identifies the decryption key\/code 3300\/402 corresponding to telephone unit 3121 based on telephone number 3260). At block 710, authentication logic 352 and\/or cryptographic module 350 on the receiving telephone unit is used to decrypt the received encrypted identification object 354. At block 712, authentication logic 352 authenticates the identity of the calling party (e.g., by evaluating and\/or verifying the legibility of the decrypted identification object 354 (e.g., by parsing various portions of the decrypted result that should correspond to a common or expected data format), by displaying the result of the decryption to the user\/owner of the receiving telephone unit or otherwise evaluating the result of the decryption). Thus, embodiments of the present disclosure enable authentication of a caller's identity in a mobile or wireless phone call. For example, embodiments of the present disclosure enable a calling party to encrypt an identification object having information corresponding to an identity of the calling party and transmit the encrypted identification information to the called party as part of the telephone call (e.g., inserted into the body of the session initiation protocol (SIP) invitation). The receiving or called party may decrypt the received identification object using a decryption key previously received from the calling party or received from a third party certificate authority (e.g., a telephone service provider). The decrypted result may then be evaluated to determine the authenticity of the identity of the calling party. For example, if the decrypted result is scrambled or illegible, the authentication logic 352 may return an error or other notice of failure of caller identity authentication. The receiving or called party may then reject the call, if desired.

The health and appearance of skin, however, can deteriorate due to environmental factors, genetic makeup, nutrition, and sun exposure. With aging, the outer skin layer (epidermis) thins, even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged. The number of pigment-containing cells (melanocytes), however, decreases. Therefore, the skin appears pale and translucent. Large pigmented spots (age spots, liver spots, or lentigos) may appear in sun-exposed areas. Changes in the connective tissue reduce the skin's strength and elasticity. This is known as elastosis. It is more noticeable in sun-exposed areas (solar elastosis). Elastosis produces the leathery, weather-beaten appearance common to farmers, sailors, and others who spend a large amount of time outdoors. Dehydration increases the risk of skin injury. Poor nutrition can also negatively impact the skin, causing dryness, rash, and puffiness. Ceramides are a group of natural waxy, fatty substances in the skin, composed of sphingosine and lipids (fatty acids) bonded together. Ceramides make up about 50% of all skin lipids and are manufactured in the lower, living cells of the epidermis. As the cells mature and move to the surface, ceramides are released to the topmost layer, the stratum corneum. In the stratum corneum layer, ceramides combine with cholesterol (another important lipid found in the skin) and fatty acids to form an ordered, tightly-packed, layered, sheet-like arrangement between the dead cells.

The compositions are particularly useful for supporting natural lipid barrier function of skin. The compositions also treat skin dryness, help repair skin damage, and eliminate the appearance of wrinkles, dark spots, and uneven skin texture. BACKGROUND Skin acts as a natural barrier between internal and external environments and therefore plays an important role in vital biological functions such as protection against mechanical and chemical injury, micro-organisms, and ultraviolet damage. The health and appearance of skin, however, can deteriorate due to environmental factors, genetic makeup, nutrition, and sun exposure. With aging, the outer skin layer (epidermis) thins, even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged. The number of pigment-containing cells (melanocytes), however, decreases. Therefore, the skin appears pale and translucent. Large pigmented spots (age spots, liver spots, or lentigos) may appear in sun-exposed areas. Changes in the connective tissue reduce the skin's strength and elasticity. This is known as elastosis. It is more noticeable in sun-exposed areas (solar elastosis). Elastosis produces the leathery, weather-beaten appearance common to farmers, sailors, and others who spend a large amount of time outdoors. Dehydration increases the risk of skin injury. Poor nutrition can also negatively impact the skin, causing dryness, rash, and puffiness. Ceramides are a group of natural waxy, fatty substances in the skin, composed of sphingosine and lipids (fatty acids) bonded together. Ceramides make up about 50% of all skin lipids and are manufactured in the lower, living cells of the epidermis. As the cells mature and move to the surface, ceramides are released to the topmost layer, the stratum corneum. In the stratum corneum layer, ceramides combine with cholesterol (another important lipid found in the skin) and fatty acids to form an ordered, tightly-packed, layered, sheet-like arrangement between the dead cells. Ceramides and cholesterol protect against moisture loss to keep skin youthful and supple, and support the skin's matrix, keeping it firm. Young individuals manufacture ample ceramides and cholesterol to keep the skin healthy. However, with age, production declines, and skin begins to sag and wrinkle.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE The cosmetic compositions of the present disclosure include: (a) cholesterol; (b) one or more ceramides; (c) one or more oils; (d) one or more emulsifiers; and (e) one or more thickeners. The compositions may also include (f) one or more active ingredients. The components of the composition can be combined to form an emulsion, including, for example oil-in-water (O\/W), water-in-oil (W\/O), and oil-in-alcohol emulsions. In some cases the composition is a water-in-oil (W\/O) emulsion. In some cases the cosmetic composition includes 1 wt. % to 10 wt. %, 2 wt. % to 8 wt. %, 3 wt. % to 6 wt. %, or about 4 wt. % of cholesterol. The total amount of the one or more ceramides is 0.1 wt. % to 5 wt. %, 0.5 wt. % to 5 wt. %, 1 wt. % to 5 wt. %, 1 wt. % to 4 wt. %, 1 wt. % to 3 wt. %, or about 2 wt. %. The one or more ceramides in the composition may include at least ceramide-3, and may also include ceramide-EOP. The ceramide-3 may be present in a greater amount than ceramide-EOP and\/or the other ceramides in the compositions. For example, ceramide-3 (or any other individual ceramide) may be present in an amount of from 0.3 wt. % to 4.0 wt. %, 0.5 wt. % to 4.0 wt. %, 0.5 wt. % to 3.0 wt. %, or from 1 wt. % to 4 wt. %. A second ceramide, such as ceramide-EOP may be present is an amount of 10 ppm to 1.0 wt. % (10,000 ppm), 10 ppm to 0.5 wt. % (5,000 ppm), or 10 ppm to 1,000 ppm. In some embodiments, the amount of cholesterol in the composition is greater than the total amount of ceramides in the compositions, for example the ratio of cholesterol to total amount of ceramides may be from 1.1:1.0 to 10:1.0, 1.5:1.0 to 5:1, or 1.8:1 to 3:1. In some embodiments, the total amount of the combination of cholesterol and the one or more ceramides is 1.3 wt. % to 15 wt. %, 1.5 wt. % to 15 wt. %, 2 wt. % to 12 wt. %, 2 wt. % to 10 wt. %, 3 wt. % to 9 wt. %, 4 wt. % to 9 wt. %, 4 wt. % to 8 wt. %, 5 wt. % to 7 wt. %, or about 6 wt. %. As mentioned above, the compositions are unique in that they include high amounts of both ceramides and cholesterol, higher amounts than have previously been incorporated into stable commercial products. Also, the compositions are distinctive because cholesterol is the dominant lipid component instead of ceramides (or other types of lipids). This is achieved by separately heating a fatty phase and an aqueous phase before emulsification to prevent recrystallization of the one or more ceramides. Also, water soluble emulsifiers that are typically added to an aqueous phase (because they are water soluble), or added post-emulsification, are added to the fatty phase before emulsification. A combination of emulsifiers is used to stabilize and maintain the high levels of ceramides and cholesterol in the composition. The composition typically includes a fatty phase and an aqueous phase. One or more oils are usually associated with the fatty phase. The amount of oil in the composition can vary, and may be from 20 wt. % to 80 wt. %, 30 wt. % to 70 wt. %, or from 40 wt. % to 60 wt. %. In some cases, the one or more oils include one or more silicone oils and\/or one or more hydrocarbon based oils, for example, the compositions may include dimethicone and\/or hydrogenated polyisobutene. To combine the fatty phase and the aqueous phase, emulsifiers are typically used. For examples organosiloxane emulsifiers such as lauryl PEG-9 polydimethylsiloxyethyl dimethicone and PEG\/PPG-18\/18 dimethicone (in dimethicone) are useful. The amount of emulsifiers in the composition typically are in an amount of 0.1 wt. % to 30 wt. %, 0.1 wt. % to 20 wt. %, 0.5 wt. % to 20 wt. %, 1 wt. % to 20 wt. %, 1 wt. % to 15 wt. %, or 1 wt. % to 10 wt. %; or from 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 or 1.0 wt. % to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 wt. %. The compositions disclosed herein may include one or more thickeners. Often more than one thickener may be used to achieve a particular consistency. In some cases, thickeners such as ammonium polyacryloyldimethyl taurate and\/or sodium polyacrlate can be useful. The amount of thickeners can vary depending on the desired consistency of the final product. The thickeners may be in an amount of 0.1 wt. % to 20 wt. %, 0.1 to 10 wt. %, 0.1 wt. % to 9 wt. %, 0.2 wt. % to 9 wt. %, 0.3 wt. % to 9 wt. %, 0.4 wt. % to 8 wt. %, 0.5 wt. % to 5 wt. %, 1 wt. % to 5 wt. %, or 2 wt. % to 4 wt. %. Further, the amount of thickener may be from 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, or 1.5 wt. % to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, or 20 wt. %. The compositions may also include an active ingredient (an ingredient other than cholesterol, ceramides, oils, emulsifiers, and thickeners, which may themselves be an active ingredient that imparts beneficial characteristics to the skin). For instance the active ingredient may be a humectant and moisturizing ingredient, an anti-aging agent, a depigmenting agent, an anti-wrinkle agent, or an agent that treats oily skin. In some embodiments, adenosine is used as at least one of the active ingredients. The compositions may include 10 ppm to 10 wt. % (100,000 ppm), 10 ppm to 5 wt. % (50,000 ppm), 10 ppm to 2.5 wt. % (25,000 ppm), 10 ppm to 1 wt. % (10,000 ppm), 10 ppm to 0.5 wt. % (5,000 ppm), 10 ppm to 0.1 wt. % (1,000 ppm), or 10 ppm to 500 ppm of one or more active ingredients. In some cases, the one or more active ingredients is present in an amount from 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, or 200 ppm to 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 0.1 wt. % (1000 ppm), 0.5 wt. % (5,000 ppm), 1 wt. % (10,000 ppm)), 5 wt. % (50,000 ppm), or 10 wt. % (100,000 ppm).

The instant disclosure also relates to methods or processes for making\/manufacturing the cosmetic compositions described herein. It also encompasses the products prepared by these methods or processes. Typically, a process for making the cosmetic compositions of the instant disclosure comprises the formation of a fatty phase and the formation of a separate aqueous phase (containing water), both phases are heated and combined while warm. Each phase may be heated to the same temperature or may be heated to different temperatures. Typically the phases are individually heated to a temperature of at least 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, or 90\u00b0 C. to 110\u00b0 C. For example, one or more of the phases may be heated to a temperature of about 60-110\u00b0 C., 70-100\u00b0 C., 80-100\u00b0 C., 85-100\u00b0 C., or 85-95\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the cholesterol, one or more ceramides, and one or more oils are combined in the fatty phase. Additionally, in some cases, one or more emulsifiers and one or more thickeners are also combined in the fatty phase. Water soluble thickeners may be added to the aqueous phase of the cosmetic compositions. However, in some cases water soluble thickeners (e.g., sodium polyacrylate, etc.) can be advantageously added to the fatty phase instead of the water phase before emulsification to help stabilize and incorporate high amounts of cholesterol and one or more ceramides into the compositions. In some cases, water soluble thickeners may also be added post-emulsification. For examples, in some instances, ammonium polyacryloydldimethyl taurate, may be added post-emulsification. After combining the fatty phase and the aqueous phase to form an emulsion, the composition is typically allowed to cool. Additional components may be added during the time of emulsification or after. For example, certain fragrances, colorings, exfoliants, active ingredients, etc., maybe added to the aqueous phase, the fatty phase, or after emulsification. The instant disclosure also relates to methods of using the cosmetic compositions described herein. For example, the cosmetic compositions can be used in a method for supporting natural lipid barrier function of skin, wherein the method comprises applying the composition to skin or hair. Typically, the cosmetic compositions are applied to this skin or hair of humans. In some cases, the composition is applied to the face. Furthermore, the cosmetic composition can be used in methods for treating dryness of the skin and\/or hair, repairing damage to skin and\/or hair (for example, damage from photoaging), and for diminishing the appearance of wrinkles, dark spots, and uneven skin texture of skin. These methods also entail application of the cosmetic compositions described herein to the skin and\/or hair, and in some cases to the face. The cosmetic composition may be applied once per day, twice per day, or more than once or twice per day. In some cases, the composition is applied in the evenings before bed. In other cases, the compositions are applies in the morning. In still other cases, the composition may be applied immediately after washing the skin and\/or hair. The compositions may be used once, or for a series of days, weeks, or months. For example, the compositions may be used daily for a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more weeks, or months. Implementation of the present disclosure is provided by way of the following examples. The examples serve to illustrate the technology without being limiting in nature. Example 1 Restorative Cream A restorative cream was prepared as a water-in-oil emulsion. Instead of ceramides as the dominant lipid component, the restorative cream contains cholesterol as the dominant lipid component. The components of the cream are presented in Table 1, below.

This helps prevent recrystallization of the ceramide-3 and ceramide-EOP. The thickener, sodium polyacrylate was added to the oil phase rather than to the water phase or during post emulsification. Both phases were maintained at 85-95\u00b0 C. during emulsification. The second thickener, ammonium polyacryloyldimethyl taurate, was added post emulsification. To stabilize ceramide-EOP and the high levels of ceramide-3 and cholesterol in the formula, the following combination of W\/O emulsifiers was used: PEG-10 Dimethicone, Dimethicone (and) Dimethicone\/PEG 10\/15 Crosspolymer, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, and Dimethicone (and) PEG\/PPG-18\/18 Dimethicone. Example 2 Improving Skin Hydration and Repairing Skin Barrier Function A clinical study was carried out to evaluate the restorative cream of Example 1. The study investigated the effectiveness of the restorative cream in improving skin hydration and repairing skin barrier function. A total of twenty-seven (27) female subjects, ranging in age from 55-73 years, consented, enrolled, and completed the study. Changes in skin conductance, impedance or capacitance are used to study epidermal hydration in vivo. The measurement is made on the difference in dielectric constant; skin has a low dielectric constant and water has a high dielectric constant of 81. When skin is hydrated, conductance and capacitance increases and impedance decreases. The measuring capacitor shows changes in capacitance according to the moisture content of the tissue. Corneometer CM 825 (Courage and Khazaka, Germany) was used to measure the electrical capacitance\/hydration of the skin. Three replicate measurements were taken from randomized treatment sites for the restorative cream and the control site (untreated skin) at each measurement interval. If one measurement was more than \u00b110 units from the other measurements this measurement was not included in the analysis. Transpeidermal water loss (TWEL) is a measure of skin barrier function. The evaporimeter probe has two sensors, which measure the vapor pressure gradient arising within the device's chamber and between the skin and the surrounding air. TEWL was measured using DermaLab Evaporimeter (Cortex Technology, Hadsun, Denmark). Decreases in TEWL indicates a repair in skin barrier function, such that less water is lost through the skin barrier. TEWL measurements were taken from the randomized designated treatment sites for the restorative cream and the control sites (untreated skin) at each measurement interval. Three days prior to the start of the study, enrolled subjects began the washout period. Subject received a neutral soap bar (Neutrogena) to use for cleansing their volar forearms (i.e., bathing) for the washout period. Subject were given specific instructions prohibiting the use of all personal care products (e.g., lotions, creams), on the test site (volar forearms) for the entire washout and study duration. Following the washout period, subject returned to the testing facility for baseline measurements. The volar surface of the forearms were gently wiped with a damp disposable washcloth and patted dry with a paper towel. Four test sites were marked on the volar surfaces of the forearms (two sites on each forearm). Each test site was 4 cm by 4 cm. Test sites were placed at least 2 cm from the wrist joint and at least 2 cm from elbow joint and were identified as Test Sites A-D. The treatment sites and control sites (untreated) were randomly assigned using a computer generated randomization code. To determine baseline (pre-treatment), skin hydration readings were taken by Corneometer for sites A and B. TEWL readings by Evaporimeter were taken for sites C and D. Packing tape was applied to the designated sites (Site C) and control (untreated) (Site D) TWEL sites. The tape was then stripped from the sites. TEWL readings by Evaporimeter were performed and repeated taping and stripping carried out until a TWEL measurement greater than 20 g\/m2h was reached. Following baseline measurements (post tape stripping), application of the restorative cream on the designated treatment test sites was performed. Approximately 2 mg\/cm2 of the restorative cream was applied to the designated treatment sites (A and C). After application, subjects remained in the exam room and were instructed to keep their volar forearms uncovered and exposed. After 15 minutes post-treatment (\u00b15 min), skin hydration readings were taken by Corneometer for sites A and B. At 1 hour post-treatment skin hydration readings were again taken. Also at 1 hour post-treatment TEWL readings were taken at sites C and D by Evaporimeter. At 2 and 4 hours post-treatment, the TEWL readings were again taken. At 8 hours post-treatment both skin hydration readings (for sites A and B) and TEWL readings (for sites C and D) were taken. Subjects were dismissed after the 8 hour post-treatment measurements were obtained but were instructed not to wet (e.g., no shower, bathing, or swimming) or apply products to their volar forearms until after the 24 hour measurements were obtained. Approximately 24 hours (\u00b130 min) after product application to the test sites, subjects returned for measurements for the final skin hydration measurements. An outline of the testing timeline is presented in Table 2, below, along with the results of the tests.

At baseline there was no statistical significant difference in skin hydration measurement between the untreated and treated sites. When evaluating hydration over time for sites treated with restorative cream, there was a statistical significant increase (improvement) in skin hydration measurements when compared to baseline measurements. When evaluating hydration over time for untreated sites, however, there was no statistical significant difference in skin hydration measurement when compared to baseline measurement at 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 8 hours. At 24 hours, there was a statistical significant decrease (worsening) in skin hydration measurement when compared to baseline. Example 3 Improving Skin Hydration and Protecting Skin Barrier Function A clinical study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the restorative cream of Example 1 in protecting skin barrier function. A total of twenty-six (26) female subjects, ranging in age from 55-71 years, consented, enrolled, and completed the study. Three days prior to the start of the study, enrolled subjects began the washout period. Subject received a neutral soap bar (Neutrogena) to use for cleansing their volar forearms (i.e., bathing) for the washout period. Subject were given specific instructions prohibiting the use of all personal care products (e.g., lotions, creams), on the test site (volar forearms) for the entire washout and study duration. Following the washout period, subject returned to the testing facility for baseline measurements. The volar surface of the forearms were gently wiped with a damp disposable washcloth and patted dry with a paper towel. Two test sites were marked on the volar surfaces of the forearms (one site on each forearm). Each test site was 4 cm by 4 cm. Test sites were placed at least 2 cm from the wrist joint and at least 2 cm from elbow joint and were identified as Test Sites A and B. The treatment sites and control sites (untreated) were randomly assigned using a computer generated randomization code. To determine baseline (pre-treatment), TEWL readings by Evaporimeter were taken at sites A and B. Subjects were given the restorative cream to use twice a day on one volar forearm (per computer generated randomization) for one week. After one week, subjects returned to the testing facility. The volar surface of the forearms were gently wiped with a damp disposable washcloth and patted dry with a paper towel. Then, TEWL readings by Evaporimeter were taken at sites A and B. Following the one week post-treatment TEWL readings a, packaging tape (Office Depot brand) was then applied to the treated site and the control (untreated) site. Following twelve consecutive tape stripping of each site, TEWL readings by Evaporimeter were again taken. An outline of the testing timeline is presented in Table 3, below, along with the results of the tests. TABLE 3 Visit 2 Visit 1 Pre-Tape Post-Tape 3-days Base- Strip Strip Procedure prior line (one week) (one week) Distribute Washout product X Restorative Cream X Distribution TEWL Measurements X X (Sites A and B) Results Improvement in Skin Hydration Protects Skin Barrier Function \u201c \u201d indicates a statistically significant improvement (p \u2266 0.05). There was a statistical difference when comparing the baseline TEWL values for the untreated and treated sites. Skin treated with the restorative cream significantly decreased TEWL values after one week of product use when compared to baseline and to the untreated control site, indicating an improvement in skin barrier function after one week. There was also a statistical difference when comparing the pre-tape strip TEWL values for the untreated and treated sites. Furthermore, TEWL values were significantly higher after tape stripping on both the treated and the untreated sites, when compared to before tape stripping. When comparing between the treated and the untreated sites, the treated sites showed a significantly smaller increase in TEWL values, indicating that the restorative cream provides a protective effect after one week of use. Example 4 Evaluation of Efficacy and Tolerance A clinical study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of the restorative cream of Example 1. A total of fifty-five (55) individuals used the restorative cream for 8 weeks. Individuals used the restorative cream for 8 weeks and various effects were evaluated immediately upon application at the start of the trial, after four weeks of use, and after eight weeks of use. The results are presented in Table 4, below.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is of an apparatus and a teaching method, and a composing method, said teaching method based on music written using said composing method that provides Music Cling sheets printed with Berry Musical music notation symbols. Piano pieces, for students who are beginning piano lessons, which comprise the Studio in the Woods Piano Series, use Berry Musical notes as a music notation for teaching students how to read music and how to play the piano. Berry Musical notes are printed as described below, on Music Cling sheets. Music Cling sheets cling to actual piano keys, as well as to an apparatus that is described in the detailed description of the invention below. Two preferred embodiments of the apparatus, described below and shown in the figures of this present invention, are provided so that said apparatus can be used by being placed upon acoustic pianos, or by being placed over electronic pianos: the first embodiment is placed on the key blocks at either end of an acoustic piano keyboard; a second embodiment stands on the floor and positions the apparatus above an electronic piano keyboard. The length of the apparatus described in the detailed description of the invention below is based upon a standard 88 key piano keyboard. An 88 key length is required because the piano teaching method described below teaches how to play a piano using all registers on a piano. The apparatus includes a white 20% translucent acrylic panel to which static cling transparent printable vinyl sheets cling. The aforementioned first embodiment, for acoustic pianos, provides an acrylic panel placed just in front of the fall board of an acoustic piano model with two side supports which rest upon each key block, one at each end of a piano keyboard, holding said acrylic panel up perpendicular to the piano keys. The aforementioned second embodiment provides the aforementioned acrylic panel supported by two supports, said supports stand on the floor and are positioned such that the acrylic panel extends over the keys of an electronic piano, perpendicular to the keys. A Music Cling sheet comprises a sheet of printable transparent static cling vinyl, cut to specific sizes, the height of each sheet being 7 inches, said height determined by the apparatus that is one object of this invention, and the length of a Music Cling sheet being determined by the length of a musical phrase printed thereon. Berry Musical notes comprise note heads printed as illustrations of wild black raspberries, and other illustrations, described below. Said Berry Musical notes are printed on a Music Cling sheet. Collections of said Music Cling sheets comprise two sets of teaching pieces that are included in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series. Some Music Cling sheets are printed with outlines of piano keys, with Berry Musical notes printed on the keys that should be played; other Music Cling sheets are printed with a five line music staff, and Berry Musical notes, as described in the detailed description of the present invention below. The teaching method that is an object of this present invention, provides principles and execution of a method for teaching music notation and piano playing according to the present invention, using Music Cling sheets to help students make connections between physical finger touches on piano keys and abstract symbols for notes, said symbols include the use of colors, as shown in the figures below. Berry Musical notes printed in said colors indicate which hand a student should use to play. Other illustrations, examples of which are shown in the figures below, indicate rhythmic duration. The first set of piano pieces in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series comprises only Music Cling sheets printed with piano key outlines and Berry Musical notes in ascending melodic phrases. Music Cling sheets printed with piano key outlines include Berry Musical notes that are played from left to right, which is considered \u201cUP\u201d the keyboard, from notes of lower pitch to notes of higher pitch. Each piece is a brief ascending melody. Said piano key outlines are sized, as described in detail below, to match actual piano key sizes when overlaid on actual piano keys. Since Music Cling sheets can be removed from the apparatus and placed over the same keys in another piano register, students play in all registers, not just in the center register surrounding middle C, from the beginning of the teaching method. The second set of piano pieces in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series comprises pairs of Music Cling sheets: the first Music Cling sheet in a pair is printed with piano key outlines and Berry Musical notes that are played from left to right, similar to aforementioned pieces in the first set; a second Music Cling sheet in a pair is printed with a staff, as described below in the detailed description, and Berry Musical notes that are played from right to left, which is considered DOWN the keyboard, from notes of higher pitch to notes of lower pitch. Each pair thus includes an ascending and a descending melodic phrase, in that order. The Berry Musical notes printed on a Music Cling sheet that is printed with a five line staff, as described below, will align with actual piano keys or piano key outlines printed on another Music Cling sheet, when the following actions are taken by a student or teacher: the aforementioned Music Cling sheet printed with a staff and Berry Musical notes is rotated 180 degrees, in the plane parallel with the piano keyboard and overlaid on the actual piano keyboard, or the aforementioned Music Cling sheet is rotated 180 degrees, in the plane parallel with the apparatus and placed over a Music Cling sheet that includes the outlines of piano keys printed on it, said apparatus positioned perpendicular to the keyboard, as described below and shown in the figures below. More advanced pieces in the second set of piano pieces in the Studio in the Woods piano Series use traditional music notation symbols so that the pieces are longer and consist of more than one pair of Music Cling sheets. Some pieces include Music Cling sheets that, when placed along the apparatus over the keyboard, will show that all of the registers depicted come together to make up the 88-key keyboard layout of a standard piano, as described below and shown in FIG. 7. The aforementioned method of teaching music notation and piano playing which requires the use of Music Cling sheets and Berry Musical notes will be described below in order of the stages that comprise said teaching method, said teaching method is one object of this present invention. The description of said stages will also include examples from The Studio in the Woods Piano Series.

The dimensions specified provide illustrations of keys that match actual piano keys when Music Cling sheets are overlaid on actual piano keys to align with the actual keys and show students which keys to play. A Music Cling sheet comprises a sheet of printable, clear, transparent static cling vinyl on which Berry Musical notes are printed. All Music Cling sheets provided by this present invention are 7 inches tall. The width of each sheet varies according to the length of the section of keyboard or staff illustrated, said section of keyboard or staff being determined by the musical phrase notated on the Music Cling sheet. The positions of Berry Musical notes on Music Cling sheets, for example, the Music Cling sheet shown in FIG. 2, are determined by first centering the Berry Musical note's note head on the black key that said note head indicates to be played, and second, aligning said note head vertically on a Music Cling sheet such that said note head is correctly aligned with the position on a specifically sized staff, described below, and shown in FIG. 4, corresponding to the pitch indicated by said note head. There are no staff lines printed on Music Cling sheets that provide illustrations of piano keys and Berry Musical notes, but the positions of Berry Musical notes on said Music Cling sheets are determined as though there were such staff lines, so that when Music Cling sheets such as the one shown in FIG. 4 are rotated 180 degrees and overlaid onto Music Cling sheets such as the one shown in FIG. 3, the notes on both Music Cling sheets align, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 8b. The teaching piece illustrated in FIG. 2 comprises 6 Berry Musical notes all using note head 1 as shown in FIG. 1, with stems and flags as shown to indicate that notes may be played with either the right or left hand, but with the indicated rhythmic durations. The B flat letter and flat symbol printed on the first black key in FIG. 2 labels the starting note of the piece for reference as the Music Cling sheet is relocated to different registers, and begins to teach association with letter names of black keys as starting pitch identifiers. The standard music repeat signs printed on the Music Cling sheet shown in FIG. 2, and the number 3.5 printed in the bottom right corner of the Music Cling sheet shown in FIG. 2, indicate that the musical phrase thus printed is to be repeated 3.5 times comprising the entire piece of music shown in FIG. 2. FIG. 3 is an image file that provides a Music Cling sheet that comprises phrase one of \u201cThe Black Bears\u201d\u00a9 2014 Carol Caldwell-Edmonds and Shannon Edmonds from the second set of teaching pieces in The Studio in the Woods Piano Series, and provides an example of a Music Cling sheet. The actual digital file size printed on the corresponding Music Cling sheet is 2063 pixels by 2548 pixels, which is 6.877 inches by 8.493 inches at 300 pixels per inch. The actual physical size of the Music Cling sheet shown in FIG. 3 is the same as the actual physical size of the Music Cling sheet in FIG. 2.

Composing Method The principles and execution of a method for composing piano pieces that, according to the present invention, satisfy the requirements for positioning Berry Musical notes on Music Cling sheets follow, it being understood that the following drawings and descriptions are given for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to be limiting. Piano music written to utilize this present invention, for example, the Studio in the Woods Piano Series' first and second sets of teaching pieces, printed on Music Cling sheets, must fulfill the following requirements: pieces in the first set comprise ascending musical phrases comprised of pitches corresponding to the black keys on a piano. Pieces are prepared for printing on Music Cling sheets using computer software that is capable of manipulating images on several layers with Berry Musical notes on one layer, superimposed on the outline of piano keys on another layer, resulting in an image, for example as shown in FIG. 2 and described above. Pieces are written to introduce the various registers on the piano by musically depicting various woodland animals, or environmental features comprising the background setting and characters featured in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series. For example, the piano teaching piece, \u201cSpinning Spiders,\u201d from the first set in the Studio in the Woods Piano series, comprises a musical phrase in the highest register on the piano keyboard, musically depicting spiders spinning webs high up in the eaves of the Studio. Pieces are composed to involve the immediate physical environment to provide association with the musical environment, which is a piano. Pieces in the second set of the Studio in the Woods Piano Series are composed under the following constraints: Each piece comprises pairs of musical phrases, such that the first musical phrase in a pair consists of ascending notes only, said phrase printed on a Music Cling sheet as described above for the first set, an example is shown in FIG. 3; pieces in the second set may comprise pitches corresponding to black keys or white keys on a piano. The second musical phrase in a pair consists of descending notes only, said second musical phrases comprise pitches corresponding to black keys or white keys on a piano. Further, said second musical phrases are prepared for printing on Music Cling sheets using computer software that is capable of manipulating images on several layers with Berry Musical notes on one layer, superimposed on a Berry Musical staff on another layer, resulting in an image, for example as shown in FIG. 4 and described above. Pieces in the second set are written to revisit phrases introduced in the first set as themes musically depicting various woodland animals, or environmental features comprising the background setting and characters featured in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series. Placement of Music Cling sheets in different piano registers comprise complex pieces consisting of several pairs of phrases, for example, the layout of \u201cThe Black Bears\u201d\u00a9 2014 Carol Caldwell-Edmonds and Shannon Edmonds, from the second set of the Studio in the Woods Piano Series, shown in FIG. 7. All piano pieces written to utilize this present invention are composed to facilitate the use of the teaching method described below. Teaching Method The principles and execution of a method for teaching students to play piano using piano pieces composed using the composing method described above, according to the present invention, may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description below, it being understood that these drawings are given for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to be limiting. The objectives of the lessons based upon first set of teaching pieces in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series comprise the first stage of the teaching method that is an object of this present invention. The first educational objective of stage one is to make a direct and concrete connection between the location of a finger touch on a particular black key on a piano keyboard, and the placement of a particular note symbol, a Berry Musical note, to represent that touch location on a piano key. A student lays a Music Cling sheet, for example, FIG. 2, on actual piano keys and plays the indicated keys by pressing the Berry Musical note heads on the Music Cling sheet, simultaneously pressing the indicated piano keys and playing the intended pitches. Then a student slides the Music Cling sheet up onto an apparatus, for example, the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, making a concrete, touch-based connection between the keys just pressed, and the symbols on a PICTURE of the same piano keyboard section. This activity introduces another educational objective of stage one, learning to associate notation symbols on an illustration of a portion of a piano keyboard to the corresponding piano keys. Repeating this process in different registers, and with different Music Cling sheets containing different musical phrases, a student learns that the notes look similar, whether laid on piano keys or set to cling to the apparatus, because the piano keys the Berry Musical notes identify are the same. However, when notes that appear similar are played in different piano registers, the pitches are higher or lower by an octave or multiple octaves, depending upon the register in which a student is directed to play. Thus, yet another educational objective of stage one of this teaching method is introduced: playing the full range of keys available, to learn the differences in pitch of keys in different piano registers. The embodiment of the apparatus that stands on the floor, FIG. 6, can be positioned over electronic keyboards that do not have 88 keys, as shown in FIG. 6E. The aforementioned apparatus is positioned such that a keyboard with fewer than 88 keys aligns with the keys a student will play which are printed on Music Cling sheets when said Music Cling sheets are placed on said apparatus in the correct registers, as determined by the musical phrase printed on said Music Cling sheets. The aforementioned embodiment that stands on the floor therefore is also used as a tool which teaches a student which subset of piano keys and registers a student has available on a keyboard with fewer than 88 keys, compared to a full 88 key piano keyboard. Berry Musical notation symbols printed on a Music Cling sheet, when placed on an apparatus that is an object of this present invention, lie in a different plane than piano keys. This present invention provides concrete embodiment of the abstract concept of perpendicular planes. Practicing the demonstration of the role of these perpendicular planes in reading music notation symbols is another educational objective of stage one. The apparatuses shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, juxtapose the plane in which piano keys lie, and the plane in which musical symbols are placed, in close proximity. A student is able to manipulate music cling sheets repeatedly. This activity comprises practice. Said practice utilizes kinesthetic memory, the use of which is an important skill in piano playing, but one underemphasized in music reading. Another educational objective of stage one is to introduce the concept of musical rhythm. Stage one of the teaching method herein described, utilizes Berry Musical note symbols using stems and flags as in traditional music, to introduce the concept of notating rhythm. The Studio in the Woods Piano Series facilitates the introduction of rhythmic values of notes using stems and flags as shown in FIG. 1 and discussed above. Rhythm is traditionally taught, in other piano lesson series, with activities which are physical, repetitive, and which therefore build kinesthetic memory, such as clapping a rhythmic phrase, singing lyrics to a tune, etc. The approach to teaching rhythm is not claimed as an object of this present invention. However, the new feature of the present invention comprises music symbols denoting rhythmic values that are also part of Berry Musical notation, examples of which are shown in 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, in FIG. 1. Said music symbols are objects of this present invention. Yet another educational objective of stage one is to introduce piano technique by teaching hand positioning. Teaching pieces in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series that use note heads 2 and 3, FIG. 1 begin to introduce hand positions. To play more challenging musical phrases, a student must determine which finger on which hand to use to press a particular piano key, and how to hold one's hand to facilitate effective playing technique. More advanced pieces at the end of the first set of teaching pieces, and the pieces of the second set of teaching pieces, for example, FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, introduce fingering and hand positions by using the aforementioned note heads. The educational objectives of stage two of the teaching method, which is an object of this present invention, relate to teaching students to comprehend the concept of a music staff, a fundamental component of music notation. In the inventors' experience, it is often at this point, at which students are introduced to reading music notation on a staff, that students who can easily manipulate printed symbols in their minds often seem to be \u201ctalented,\u201d and those who cannot quit piano lessons. Stage two of the teaching method that is an object of this present invention is designed to address this shortcoming in traditional piano teaching methods. FIG. 8, and FIGS. 8A through 8D comprise a series of drawings which illustrate how Music Cling sheets comprising the second of each pair of musical phrases in the second set of the Studio in the Woods piano series are used to teach the concept of the five line music staff. FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 comprise a pair of Music Cling sheets that are phrase 1 and phrase 2, respectively of \u201cThe Black Bears\u201d\u00a9 2014 Carol Caldwell-Edmonds and Shannon Edmonds, a piece in set two of the Studio in the Woods Piano Series, as described above. Teaching the concept of a five line staff as follows comprises an object of this present invention. The following steps comprise an example of how the present invention provides a means to teach said concept: Step one: A student first lays a Music Cling sheet, for example, FIG. 3, on a piano keyboard so that the illustrations of piano keys on the Music Cling sheet align with the actual piano keys, in a piano register indicated by a teacher, resulting in a layout as shown in FIG. 8, which shows the lowest piano register on an 88 key piano keyboard. Step two: A student then slides the Music Cling sheet up onto the apparatus, resulting in the layout shown in FIG. 8A, said layout positioned on an apparatus on a piano in front of the fallboard. Step two thus teaches a student to make a concrete touch-based connection between the keys just pressed, and the symbols on a picture of the same piano keyboard section, said picture being in the abstract plane, in which written music is viewed, perpendicular to the piano keyboard. Step three: FIG, 8B, illustrated from a viewpoint looking down from above at a piano keyboard, illustrates the next step in which a student lays a Music Cling sheet, for example, FIG. 4, face down, so that the printed side of the Music Cling sheet touches the keys, on the piano keys. The Music Cling sheet shown in FIG. 4 provides Berry Musical notes printed on a Berry Musical staff, said notes align with the same register of piano keys played in step one above, but a different sequence of Berry Musical notes is indicated. A directional arrow on said Music Cling sheet points from right to left when placed as described. Looking at FIG. 8, compared to FIG. 8B shows that these are the same keys, in the same register, indicated by FIG. 3. However, because Music Cling sheets comprising the second in each pair of musical phrases such as FIG. 4, for example, identify which keys to play moving right to left, as indicated by the arrow printed on said Music Cling sheets, Music Cling sheets, such as FIG. 4, must first be rotated 180 degrees in the same plane that the piano keys occupy before being slid into place in a different plane, provided by the apparatus. Step four: A student manipulates the Music Cling sheet as described in step three, the aforementioned rotation, shown in FIG. 8C. Step five: The result of the aforementioned sliding into place, after the rotation shown in FIG. 8C, is shown in FIG. 8D. FIG. 8D thus illustrates the arrangement of phrase 1 and 2 of \u201cThe Black Bears\u201d\u00a9 2014 Carol Caldwell-Edmonds and Shannon Edmonds, on the apparatus after both Music Cling sheets have been correctly placed on the apparatus. Step six: A student then plays both musical phrases, in order, reading left to right, as a teacher notes that piano keys in the second musical phrase of a pair are read left to right, but played right to left. Repeatedly manipulating Music Cling sheets as described above, in steps one through six, on a piano keyboard, and on an apparatus as described, provides a concrete embodiment of the abstract concept of a music staff, and helps a student make a corresponding mental connection between Berry Musical note symbols and the piano keys said note symbols represent. Using this present invention, students learn to read music notation symbols without the need to memorize letter name associations, accidentals, or key signatures. Instead, a student practices physical manipulation of Music Cling sheets to build kinesthetic memory associations. Teachers are able to teach techniques that help students affect the sounds a piano makes as Music Cling sheets are moved from register to register, for example, bass registers may be chosen to sound like a \u201cpapa bear\u201d black bear; the highest register could sound like a \u201cbaby bear,\u201d encouraging creative interpretations of the characters and their musical themes. The piano keyboard comprises the plane in which keys are played; the apparatus comprises the plane in which music notation exists. The manipulation of Music Cling sheets described in the preceding paragraph also teaches that Music Cling sheets illustrating piano keys played from left to right cannot be placed on the apparatus in the same way as the Music Cling sheets illustrating the Berry Musical Staff which indicate notes to be played from right to left. A student sliding a Music Cling sheet into place on the apparatus correctly learns to make mental connections about how ascending and descending notes correspond to playing piano keys from left to right and right to left, respectively, and said connections do not require memorization or an understanding of musical notation letter names or accidentals. Connections are made through practice and promote kinesthetic learning. The second set of piano teaching pieces in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series includes pieces in which Berry Musical notes are combined with standard music notation to provide a transition from the illustrated notation symbols, for example, symbols shown in FIG. 1, to standard traditional representations of musical notes and rests. Standard music notation symbols are printed on Music Cling sheets in sizes specified for Berry Musical notes when first introduced, but said standard music notation symbols are reduced in printed size when printed in book format, said books follow the sets of pieces printed on Music Cling sheets, gradually introducing students to the grand staff and printed standard music notation. Another educational objective of both stage one and stage two of the teaching method that is an object of this present invention is to provide opportunities and tools to promote spiral learning: students revisit phrases learned in first set of piano teaching pieces in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series, as the ascending first phrases of pieces in the second set. The teaching method herein described employs active learning, and follows a student's natural learning style as exhibited in the behavior of singing: pitches and melody are sung long before representations of note heads and symbols of musical notation are learned. This teaching method and the Music Cling sheets described herein provide tools to teach students musical notation through active practice. Students play the piano, and play all of the keys available, before they learn to read printed music notation and the letter names of notes. Practiced manual manipulation builds associations to enable transference of concepts practiced using Music Cling sheets to the abstract concept of the music grand staff, which is essential to learning traditional music notation. A final educational objective of this teaching method is to teach the Studio in the Woods Piano Series pieces with recorded accompaniments, said accompaniments are included with the Studio in the Woods Piano Series, to develop the skills of listening to other music while playing the piano, and synchronizing one's own playing with said other music. To be focused on reading notes is not music making; learning to make an instrument sound certain ways-like a big bear, or a graceful moth, or a busy spider, is learning music. The Studio in the Woods Piano Series provides teachers with piano teaching pieces and recorded accompaniments which together promote awareness of one's environment: the sounds and themes inspired by the natural environment, as well as awareness of one's whole instrument, a piano. Students learn to play piano as part of a larger experience, and learn to listen and notice elements of the environments around them, musically reimagining said elements. cm What is claimed is:","cpc_label":"G09B15026","ipc_label":"G09B1502","filing_date":"20160102","patent_issue_date":"20170502","date_published":"20160728","examiner_id":"95482.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for composing music, teaching music notation, and teaching playing the piano., in the context of the novelty:  The present invention provides an apparatus and teaching method, and a composing method .

Said hand placements match the fingering patterns for playing scales on a piano that include all black keys, for example, with fingers 3 and 2 of the left hand on groups of two black keys, and fingers 4-3-2 of the left hand on groups of three black keys; and, or fingers 2 and 3 of the right hand on groups of two black keys, and fingers 2-3-4 of the right hand on groups of three black keys. This invention does not require that students memorize letters, symbols and the music staff, rather it allows students to manipulate symbols when printed on Music Cling sheets as described; the manipulation and tactile approach comprising practice of the method. 17. A kit for teaching piano playing according to claim 16, a piano playing teaching method comprising gradual introduction of standard musical notation through spiraling, specifically as described in the detailed description of the invention above. Illustrations shown in FIG. 1 are combined with traditional standard music notation symbols, for example, dots, repeat bar lines, half notes, rests, etc. as needed to correctly represent musical phrases in more advanced teaching pieces in the Studio in the Woods Piano Series. Combining Berry Musical notes with standard notation comprises a stage of the teaching method further described above. 18. A kit for teaching piano playing according to claim 16, a piano playing teaching method comprising pieces of music composed according to the aforementioned piano music composition method which relate the physical environment around the physical studio to the physical environment of the piano keyboard: for example, a big black bear in the lowest register, chickadees and spiders in the highest, or squirrels and chipmunks up and down and all over the keys. Using music compositions specifically written for the teaching method encourages students to use their ears to hear the musical depiction of a character or environmental feature, think about the characters and whether the sounds they create are like a tiny spider or a huge black bear; and to adjust their touch on the keys to make sounds corresponding to their interpretations. 19. A kit for teaching piano playing according to claim 16, a piano playing teaching method comprising pieces written to encourage students to watch their hands and observe the keyboard instead of focusing on the staff and letter names of notes. Instead of teaching students to avoid observing their own hands in order to master reading music, students are taught to observe their hands and listen to the sounds they make. '<s>'"}

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT(S) OF THE INVENTION The present inventor has realized that the existing tools for evacuating wounded team members from a dangerous environment to a safe location where they may receive medical treatment are not suitable for the small-footprint teams of today. Thus, it has been realized by the inventor that would be highly advantageous for any new litter type of device to be single-man portable, lightweight, and very quick to deploy. Having reviewed a variety of existing lightweight compact litter products, the present inventor found shortcomings in all of them relative to today's small-footprint mission profile. For example, many firefighter drag harnesses presume that the team member is wearing a very heavy duty, long-length (below the waist) \u201cturnout coat\u201d, which becomes somewhat of a drag sled when another firefighter pulls on the collar. These long length coats are not suitable for use in combat or police tactical missions, however. Another common litter is a body-length sheet of plastic which is normally kept rolled up until needed. When needed, it is unrolled, the wounded team member is slid or lifted onto the litter, and then the longitudinal edges are pulled together by straps over the top of the member's body, i.e. across the chest, hips and legs, to form a curl down the length of the litter and stiffen it. Then, it can be lifted and carried by handles, or dragged behind one or two members of the team. However, even the fastest of experienced users take a minimum of 60 seconds to un-roll, position, move the wounded, fasten the straps, and prepare to move. While this seems quick in theory, if the rescuing member is under gun fire or threat of approaching building flames, 60 seconds can be an eternity and quite dangerous. Host Vest. Embodiments of the present invention are especially useful when used in conjunction with a vest, such as a climbing vest, an integral drag vest in a fireman's coat, or a military or law enforcement protective plate carrier vest (200) such as that shown in FIG. 2. This vest, and the sketches thereof, are fully described in unrelated U.S. Patent Application Publication 2014\/0201879 to Seuk, et al. It is use only as an exemplary host vest, and those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be realized in a variety of embodiments suitable for attachment to other makes, models, and types of safety vests and harnesses. To provide context for the disclosure of the exemplary embodiments, we shall refer to a vest front panel (202) which generally is positioned on the chest and\/or belly of a wearer, a vest rear panel (not visible in this view), one or more shoulder straps (201a, 201b), front accessory attachment straps (204a, 204b), and a drag or lift handle (201) position near a top of the vest rear panel. Referring now to FIG. 3, a rear-view of the exemplary Seuk plate carrier vest is shown, in which two side panels (203a, 203b) can be seen, and one or more rear accessory attachment straps (204c, 204d). Also, from this view and that of FIG. 2, one can see a series attachment loops which are constructed from a set of horizontal strips of material, stitched periodically to the vest, with the unstitched segments forming the attachment loops, such as the Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) and Pouch Attachment Ladder System (PALS) attachment systems used by the U.S. military and allied forces. And, FIG. 4 provides a left-side view of the exemplary plate carrier vest (200) as taught by Seuk, in which the left side (203b) connection is shown, left edges of the vest front panel (202) and vest rear panel (205) can be seen connected across the top by a shoulder strap (201b), with the drag handle (210). This host vest will be used only for illustrative purposes of the structure and manner of use of the embodiments of the present invention, and does not form a part of the invention nor does it limit the embodiments of the invention to use only with this particular host vest. The Wearable Rescue Sled. Turning to FIG. 1, a flattened front view of a rescue sled (100) is shown, in which a main sheet of strong and flexible material has a seat area (101) bounded by a left edge (104b) (referenced to the wearer's left), a right edge (104a), a top edge (102) and a bottom edge (103). One or more attachment orifices, tabs, or holes (107a, 107b) are formed near the top edge (102). Optionally, the sled (100) may have one or more side grab handles (105a, 105b) formed therein or attached thereto. The strong, flexible material can be any suitable sheet material which can withstand the rigors of being slid or dragged over a variety of terrain, including but not limited to dirt, gravel, concrete, bricks, mud, sand, tile, carpet, and wood while being loaded with an typical human with necessary gear (firefighting gear, military gear, law enforcement gear, etc.), and be strong enough to be pulled by an edge and not tear or rip, while also being light weight and reducing friction between the seat of pants of the wearer and the ground. A variety of plastics, such as polymers and polystyrene, are suitable, as well as various fabrics such as rip-stop nylon and ballistic nylon. One such plastic material can readily be found in a retail product used to line a trash bag while filling it with leaves, sticks, or construction debris manufactured by Lawson Products Inc. and sold as Easy Bagger\u2122 40500. Another such plastic material is commonly used to fabricate deer and game sleds. Achieving the basic shape and feature of the exemplary embodiment (200) and other embodiments may be accomplished by cutting (blade, laser, water jet, etc.) or stamping (e.g., die cutting) a bulk sheet material, molding (e.g., injection, blow, etc.), or stitching. In practice, the sled may be a single or unitary device, or it may be comprised of two or more components, panels, and\/or layers. Referring now to FIG. 5, the rescue sled (100) is shown attached to the vest (200) towards a lower extremity of the vest rear panel, but not necessarily at the exact bottom edge of the vest rear panel. Attachment is via a hinge or pivotal means, such as the accessor straps (204c, 204d), the MOLLE webbing, or via other suitable scheme (tying, stitching, hook-and-loop fasteners, etc.). In the configuration shown in FIG. 5, the sled (100) is hanging downward in the same manner that it used to drag the wearer using the vest's drag handle (201) or via an optional tether. FIG. 6 shows a flat view (a) of a variation embodiment which includes one or more ridges (600) which promote sliding, such as debossed ridges. A bottom-edge view (b) and left-edge view (c) illustrate the depth or height of the ridges. A left-side view of this configuration is shown in FIG. 7, in which the left-edge (104b) of the sled is presented, and the sled's bottom edge (103) becomes a trailing edge while being dragged by applying a force (700) to the vest's drag handle (210) or via an optional tether. In this configuration, the flexible sheet material of the sled (100) forms a bending angle (800b) between the upper edge (102) and the lower edge (103), thereby providing a seat for the wearer (not shown). When the wearer's shoulders are elevated such that his or her torso is at an angle, such as that shown by the position of the vest (200) in this figure, the majority of the wearer's body weight is placed on the seat formed by the bent sled (100). Without the sled, the vest wearer's body weight would be impinging on the ground through the wearer's pants, which may be of a relatively high friction coefficient with the ground, and the features of which (e.g., pockets, holster rigs, utility loops, etc.) may form a snag hazard when being dragged. However, with the sled positioned in a manner such as this, the dragging effort (700) is significantly lessened due to the improved friction coefficient, and the snag hazard is minimized by covering the pants feature and by forming a toboggan-like leading edge (800b). This leading edge, being rounded and slick, allows the rescuer to easily lift or drag the wearer over bumps, rises and even stairs. The attachment points (107a, 107b, 204c, 204d) of the top edge (102) of the sled to the vest maintain the sled in position underneath the wearer's hips, and prevents the sled from being left behind as the wearer is advanced in the direction of the dragging force (700). FIG. 8 provides a perspective view of the sled-configuration shown in FIG. 7, in which the sled is bent to form a semi-elevated seat in which the wearer rides while being dragged (700). In this particular view, one can see the usefulness of the optional side handled (105a, 105b), which can be held by the wearer while dragging to stabilize themselves, or used by rescue personnel to help lift the wearer over obstacles, into vehicles, etc. Now referring to FIG. 9, the stowed position of the sled (200) is shown in which the lower edge (103) is raised above the upper edge (102), hinging it on the attachment points (107a, 107b, 204c, 204d) such that the sled is positioned essentially flat and parallel to the vest rear panel of the vest (200). To retain the sled in this position, a number of retention means may be employed, such as a straps, snaps, hook-and-loop fasteners, magnets, non-permanent glue, ties and buckles. FIG. 10 illustrates an optional embodiment feature of a pack or pouch (199) disposed or attached to the sled (100) to hold a variety of optional features, such as a tow tether, an folded or rolled full-length cloth litter, or other supplies such as first aid supplies. FIG. 11 provides a left-side view of the optional embodiment of FIG. 10. FIG. 12 illustrates another embodiment according to the invention in which the sled portion (103) stows (a) into a pack (1200) by sliding up into the pack rather than hinging, thereby allowing the presentation of webbing on the pack for the addition of accessories and other gear. This variation in embodiment deploys the sled (103) by releasing a retention means (e.g., snap, strap, hook-and-loop fastener, etc.), and sliding (b) the sled (103) downwards until it reaches and lowered extreme position (c) in which the upper edge it retained to the bottom of the pack (1200) or vest (200), or both. SUMMARY The foregoing exemplary embodiments are intended to teach how to make and use the invention, but not to express the limits of the spirit and scope of the invention. In some embodiments, a disclosed singular element may be replaced by a plurality of elements, and vice versa, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Everything described and shown in this document is an example of subject matter falling within the scope of the claims, appended below. Any specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are merely for purposes of describing how to make and use example embodiments. Several different embodiments not specifically disclosed herein may fall within the claim scope; as such, the claims may be embodied in many alternate forms and should not be construed as limited to only example embodiments set forth herein. It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of example embodiments. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be understood that when element(s) are referred to in relation to one another, such as being \u201cconnected,\u201d \u201ccoupled,\u201d \u201cmated,\u201d \u201cattached,\u201d or \u201cfixed\u201d to another element(s), the relationship can be direct or with other intervening elements. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., \u201cbetween\u201d versus \u201cdirectly between,\u201d \u201cadjacent\u201d versus \u201cdirectly adjacent,\u201d etc.). Similarly, a term such as \u201cconnected\u201d for communications purposes includes all variations of information exchange routes between two devices, including intermediary devices, networks, etc., connected wirelessly or not.

It should also be noted that the structures and operations discussed below may occur out of the order described and\/or noted in the figures. For example, two operations and\/or figures shown in succession may in fact be executed concurrently or may be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality\/acts involved. Similarly, individual operations within example methods described below may be executed repetitively, individually or sequentially, so as to provide looping or other series of operations. It should be presumed that any embodiment having features and functionality described below, in any workable combination, falls within the scope of example embodiments. The inventors have recognized that existing systems of co-sleeping carry a risk of crushing death or choking death due to rolling over during co-sleeping. For fear of such a risk, a co-sleeper may be unable to sleep or to sleep for a sufficient time. During co-sleeping on a bed, a baby may roll over and fall from the bed. Placing a baby-bed next to or in the bed of the co-sleeper may requires a large room, and may present an uneven sleeping surface and thus the co-sleeper may uncomfortably feel or lay on the uneven surface. Such a co-sleeping bed generally cannot be used for purposes other than co-sleeping. Example embodiments described below uniquely solve these and other newly-recognized problems by providing a co-sleeping cushion that prevents accidents of crushing death or choking death during co-sleeping, is capable of being used for preventing babies from fallout, and\/or is also capable of being used for assistance for sitting up as well as securing safety during co-sleeping. The present invention is a supported cushion that permits safe and configurable co-sleeping among several humans. In contrast to the present invention, the few example embodiments and example methods discussed below illustrate just a subset of the variety of different configurations that can be used as and\/or in connection with the present invention. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an example embodiment cushion for co-sleeping. A planar latch plate 10 is coupled with an L-shape plate 20 via a belt member 30. This L-shape plate 20 supports a cushion member 40. FIG. 5 is an elevation view indicating an example embodiment. FIG. 6 is a right side view of the same. FIG. 7 is a plan bottom view of the same. As depicted, the cushion for co-sleeping is used in the form as follows: the belt member 30 intermediates between a bottom 2 and a mattress 3 that constructs a bed 1; the latch plate 10 is locked by the mattress 3 and the bottom 2; and the L-shaped plate 20 is supported at the position contacting a side of the mattress 3 opposite to the side of the latch plate 10 locked. Then, the L-shaped plate 20 supports the cushion member 40 placed on the mattress 3. FIGS. 2-4 are description figures indicating an example embodiment. FIG. 2 indicates a state that the cushion member 40 is bent in the form of U-shape (like the Japanese letter \u201cko\u201d) so that one side of it is supported by L-shaped plate 20. When a baby is put inside the cushion member 40 in the form of U-shape, the cushion member 40 works as a barrier and thus prevents problems that the co-sleeper covers the baby by rolling over and\/or the hand of the co-sleeper covers the mouth of the baby. FIG. 3 depicts a state that the cushion member 40 is formed straightforward and placed on the side of the mattress 3. FIG. 4 depicts a state that the cushion member 40 is bent by 90 degrees and placed on the corner of the mattress 3. Placing the cushion 40 on the mattress 3 in this formation to form a wall makes it possible to prevent a baby from fallout from the bed. Inside the cushion member 40, a bendable pipe 41 is enclosed. Thus, the cushion member 40 may be bent in various forms as shown in FIGS. 8A-8F. Formation in straightforward as shown in FIG. 8A, formation in U-shape as shown in FIG. 8B, formation bent by 90 degrees as shown in FIG. 8C, formation in S-shape as shown in FIG. 8D, formation in a circular shape so that an inclined surface comes to an inner circumference as shown in FIG. 8E, and formation in a circular shape so that an inclined surface comes to an outer circumference as shown in FIG. 8F are possible, allowing usage as a toy or for assistance for sitting-in of the baby. As described, example embodiments make it possible to provide a space that secures a safe sleeping environment for infants. An example embodiment co-sleeping cushion is mainly comprised of a latch plate 10, an L-shaped plate 20, a belt member 30 and a cushion member 40 as depicted in FIG. 1. FIG. 5 indicates the latch plate 10 that penetrates the belt member 30 into the center of a planar bar member, having two holes 11 for coupling with the belt member 30. FIG. 6 depicts an L-shaped plate 20 provided with two holes 22 in which the belt member 30 is inserted into one side portion 21 which is a bar member bent in the form of L-shaped, to couple with the belt member 30. Although three L-shaped members 20 are used in FIG. 1, the embodiment is not limited to this number and one or more members may be used depending on the shape of the cushion 40. The belt member 30 may be one string body or branched as shown in FIG. 1. At any rate, it may be branched depending on the number of L-shaped member 20 and may be branched depending on the number of latch plate 10 on the side of coupling with the latch plate 10 although not depicted. Further, an adjuster 31 intermediates in the belt member 30 to allow the length of the belt member adjustable according to the width of a mattress. The cushion member 40 is comprised of a cushion 41, a cushion cover 42 that accommodates the cushion 41, a bendable pipe 43 equipped in the cushion 41. FIG. 13 is a perspective view of a cushion cover. FIG. 14 is a sectional view of A-A line section. Two members of the cushion 41a and the cushion 41b are overlaid in an upward\/downward direction to form a substantially triangular section as a whole. Then, the bendable pipe 43 intermediates between the cushion 41a and the cushion 41b. Of course, this is only an example and it is possible to form the cushion as one body and provide a long hole in which the bendable pipe is inserted. The bendable pipe 43 should be strong enough to maintain the shape of bending when the cushion 41 is bent. For example, the metallic flexible pipe may be used. FIGS. 11A-11C depicts elevation views of the cushion cover. FIG. 12 depicts a perspective view of a cushion cover. The cushion cover 42 is formed to be similar to the outline of the cushion 41. One side 42d of the cushion cover 42 is formed openable to accommodate the cushion 41 and has fasteners 42a on both edges. Meanwhile, bottom sides 42b do not have fasters because L-shaped plates 20 should be inserted. A planar fastener 42e is provided with a piece of patch 42c is extended from the bottom side 42b and is used to contact a planar fastener 42f provided in the side 42d. When using, the cushion 41 is accommodated in the cushion cover 42 and the piece of patch 42c is closed. Then, the side 42d is put on them and the planar fasteners 42e and 42f are connected so that the state of closing is maintained and the fastener 42a is closed further. At this time, an L-shaped plate 20 is inserted in the space between the piece of patch 42c and the side 42d. The method of supporting the cushion member 40 by the L-shaped plate 20 is only one example. As long as the cushion member 40 can be supported, an arbitrary way may be adopted. Some example embodiments and methods being described here and in the incorporated documents, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that example embodiments may be varied through routine experimentation and without further inventive activity. For example, although example embodiments describe a bendable pipe it is understood that any flexible, shape-retaining structures is included within the meaning of such a pipe. Variations are not to be regarded as departure from the spirit and scope of the exemplary embodiments, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.","cpc_label":"A47C2108","ipc_label":"A47C2108","filing_date":"20160102","patent_issue_date":"20170124","date_published":"20160519","examiner_id":"81818.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention is a supported cushion that permits safe and configurable co-sleeping among several humans., in the context of the novelty:  Cushions join to the mattress via an L-shaped plate that seats against a side an under a bottom of the mattress .

Field This disclosure relates generally to data processing of linguistic data, and, more particularly, to a natural language processing system and method for resolving partial matches. 2. Background A natural language processing (NLP) system is a computer-implemented software system that intelligently derives meaning and context from a natural language input, such as an input string of natural language text. A NLP system assists the computer in distinguishing how words are used in different contexts and in applying rules to construct syntactical and meaning representations. A NLP system has many different applications where a computer derives meaning and information from a natural language query or command, including (but not limited to) formulating database searches, speech and handwriting recognition, grammar and spell checking, and language translation.

Field This disclosure relates generally to data processing of linguistic data, and, more particularly, to a natural language processing system and method for resolving partial matches. 2. Background A natural language processing (NLP) system is a computer-implemented software system that intelligently derives meaning and context from a natural language input, such as an input string of natural language text. A NLP system assists the computer in distinguishing how words are used in different contexts and in applying rules to construct syntactical and meaning representations. A NLP system has many different applications where a computer derives meaning and information from a natural language query or command, including (but not limited to) formulating database searches, speech and handwriting recognition, grammar and spell checking, and language translation. A challenge in existing NLP systems is the ability to match products or entities that are not fully specified in a natural language input or query. For example, in a NLP system that parses user input or queries to find entities (e.g., products) in a list (e.g., catalog), the list may include the following entities: 1. Optima\u2122 AgfaPhoto\u2122 102 2. Canon\u2122 EOS\u2122 5D mark iii 3. EOS\u2122 Rebel\u2122 t3i 4.

BRIEF SUMMARY In one aspect of this disclosure, a computer implemented natural language processing system and method are disclosed for resolving partial matches. A natural language input query is received that does not fully specify an entity. The input query is tokenized into a constituent set of query tokens. An entity index is searched by comparing the query tokens to contents of the index, the contents representing a plurality of entities, each of which is tokenized into a constituent set of entity tokens associated with the tokenized entity. A plurality of partial match query tokens are identified from the set of query tokens, each partial match query token matching at least one entity token in the index. A determination is made whether a sequential break exists in the input query between the partial match query tokens. For each partial match query token, the entity corresponding to each partial match query token are determined by identifying the entity associated with each entity token in the index that matches the partial match query token. A determination is made whether there is an intersection between the identified entities corresponding to the partial match query tokens. When a sequential break exists in the input query between the partial match query tokens and there is no intersection between the identified entities corresponding to the partial match query tokens, a determination is made that the input query relates to a plurality of entities, and a response is presented to a user based upon the identified entities. In another aspect of this disclosure, a computer implemented natural language processing system and method are disclosed for resolving partial matches when a natural language input query does not fully specify an entity. The input query is tokenized into a constituent set of query tokens. The query tokens are compared to contents of a searchable index, the contents representing a plurality of entities, each of which is tokenized into a constituent set of entity tokens associated with the tokenized entity. A plurality of partial match query tokens are identified from the set of query tokens, each partial match query token matching at least one entity token in the index.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION This application discloses a computer-implemented natural language processing (NLP) system and method for resolving partial matches between entities stored in memory and a tokenized user input or query. FIG. 1 is a high level representation of an illustrative NLP system 10 for resolving partial matches in response to a natural language input or query from a user. A user of client computers 11, 12 may submit a natural language input or query to the NLP system 10 over network 5, which may be, for example, an intranet, extranet or the Internet. In this embodiment, the term \u201cuser\u201d refers to a person or persons interacting with the NLP system 10 and the term \u201cuser input\u201d refers to a query posed by the user. It is understood, however, that other embodiments can be constructed where the term \u201cuser\u201d refers to a computer system generating a query, and where the term \u201cuser input\u201d refers to a computer-generated query. It is understood that skilled artisans may implement a further extension to the NLP system 10 shown in FIG. 1, to employ one or more modules for enabling I\/O communication between a user or computer system and the NLP system 10 according to (but not limited to) the following user input modalities of text, audio, video, gesture, tactile input and output, etc. Thus, in one embodiment, both a user input or query and a generated query response may be provided in accordance with one or more of multiple modalities including (but not limited to) text, audio, image, video, tactile or gesture. Referring to FIG. 2, the NLP system 10 may be operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing systems, environments or configurations. Examples of well-known computing systems, environments and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with NLP system 10 include (but are not limited to) server computer systems, personal computer systems, thin clients, thick clients, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, mainframe computer systems, and distributed cloud computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like. NLP system 10 may be described in the general context of computer system-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer system. Generally, program modules may include routines, programs, objects, components, logic, data structures, and so on that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. As shown in FIG. 2, NLP system 10 is illustrated in the form of a special purpose computer system. The components of NLP system 10 may include (but are not limited to) one or more processors or processing units 16, a system memory 28, and a bus 18 that couples various system components including memory 28 to processor 16. Bus 18 represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus. Processor 16 may execute computer programs stored in memory 28. Any suitable programming language can be used to implement the routines of particular embodiments including C, C++, Java, assembly language, etc. Different programming techniques can be employed such as procedural or object oriented. The routines can execute on a single NLP system 10 or multiple NLP systems. Further, multiple processors 16 may be used. NLP system 10 typically includes a variety of computer system readable media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by NLP system 10, and it includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media. System memory 28 can include computer system readable media in the form of volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM) 30 and\/or cache memory 32. NLP system 10 may further include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/non-volatile computer system storage media. By way of example only, storage system 34 can be provided for reading from and writing to a non-removable, non-volatile magnetic media (not shown and typically referred to as a \u201chard drive\u201d). Although not shown, a magnetic disk drive for reading from and writing to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk (e.g., a \u201cfloppy disk\u201d), and an optical disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable, non-volatile optical disk such as a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or other optical media can be provided. In such instances, each can be connected to bus 18 by one or more data media interfaces. As will be further depicted and described below, memory 28 may include at least one program product having a set (e.g., at least one) of program modules that are configured to carry out the functions of embodiments described in this disclosure. NLP indexing module(s) 40 and NLP query processing module(s) 50 may be stored in memory 28 by way of example, and not limitation, as well as an operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data. Each of the operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data or some combination thereof, may include an implementation of a networking environment. NLP indexing module(s) 40 and NLP query processing module(s) 50 are executable by processor 16 to generally carry out the functions and\/or methodologies of embodiments described herein. NLP indexing module(s) 40 and NLP query processing module(s) 50 may be separate software processes, or they may be implemented within the same software process. NLP system 10 may also communicate with one or more external devices 14 such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a display 24, etc.; one or more devices that enable a user to interact with NLP system 10; and\/or any devices (e.g., network card, modem, etc.) that enable NLP module 10 to communicate with one or more other computing devices. Such communication can occur via Input\/Output (I\/O) interface(s) 22. In addition, NLP system 10 can communicate with one or more networks such as a local area network (LAN), a general wide area network (WAN) and\/or a public network (e.g., the Internet) via network adaptor 20. As depicted, network adaptor 20 communicates with other components of NLP system 10 via bus 18. It should be understood that although not shown, other hardware and\/or software components could be used in conjunction with NLP system 10. Examples include (but are not limited to) microcode, device drivers, redundant processing units, external disk drive arrays, RAID systems, tape drives, and data archival storage systems, etc. FIGS. 3 and 5 illustrates a block diagram of NLP indexing module(s) 40 executable by processor 16 of the NLP system 10 and an illustrative sequence of steps for generating a tokenized product or entity index 340 based on a product listing or other entity structure 300. For example, the product listing 300 may be a listing of full product names extracted from a catalog (step 500). Alternatively, the listing 300 may be a repository or corpus of documents or other data from which the full product or entity names are extracted. The product listing 300 may be stored in memory 28 of the NLP system 10, or remotely in a database or storage device that is accessible by the NLP system 10. The NLP indexing module(s) 40 preferably include a tokenizer 310, supplemental information sources 320 and morphological variation module 330. The tokenizer 310 locates word boundaries in the textual string of each product or entity in the product listing 300 and segments the textual string into linguistic units (\u201ctokens\u201d), such as words, punctuation, numbers, alpha-numerics, etc. (step 510). In other words, the tokenizer 300 breaks down the textual string into understandable segments. In the most general sense, a token is an alpha-numeric string that occurs between white space and\/or punctuation. The tokenizer 310 is preferably based on language-modeling principles of high-frequency entities to identify the lowest possible tokenization value. Moreover, in order to find the optimal tokenization pattern, the tokenizer 310 preferably uses a combination of n-gram modeling and TF-IDF tokenization techniques. For example, if the NLP system 10 is being utilized to parse natural language user input to identify items in a listing 300 (e.g., products in a catalog) and the listing includes the product \u201cCanon EOS 5D Mark iii,\u201d then tokenizer 310 would preferably tokenize the product (step 510) as follows: <product> <category text=\u201ccanon\u201d\/> <format text=\u201ceos\u201d\/> <sub-family text=\u201c5d mark iii\u201d\/> <name text=\u201cEOS Canon 5d mark iii\u201d\/> <\/product> In this example, the tokenizer 310 uses language-modeling principles of high-frequency entities to prevent \u201c5D Mark iii\u201d from being tokenized into three separate tokens. This is advantageous since \u201ciii\u201d on its own could not lead the NLP system 10 with high confidence to the conclusion that the user was specifying the product \u201cEOS Canon 5d mark iii.\u201d Rather, the tokenizer 310 will determine through language-modeling principles of high frequency entities that \u201c5d mark iii\u201d is the lowest possible tokenization value that could indicate the product specified by the user. Once the product or entity in the listing 300 has been tokenized by tokenizer 310 (step 510), supplemental information sources 320 may be used to supplement the tokenized product with additional information (step 520), which may be obtained from external structured sources (e.g., product catalog) or from interviews with subject matter experts (SME). For instance, in the example above, the NLP system 10 may utilize supplemental information sources 320 to transform the tokenized product in the example above as follows: <product> <formal-name text=\u201ccameras\u201d\/> <category text=\u201ccanon\u201d\/> <brand text=\u201cdslr\u201d\/> <format text=\u201ceos\u201d\/> <sub-family text=\u201c5d mark iii\u201d\/> <name text=\u201cEOS Canon 5d mark iii\u201d\/> <\/product> Supplementing the tokenization with additional information using supplemental information sources 320 (step 520) will allow the NLP system 10 to potentially match a user input of \u201cHow many dslr cameras have we sold?\u201d to the \u201cEOS Canon 5D Mark iii\u201d item in the list above. In addition to supplementing the tokenization (step 520), the morphological variation module 330 supplements the tokenization further with morphological variations derived from an external source (step 530), such as (but not limited to) a lexical database of English (e.g., WordNet\u2122). For instance, the morphological variation module 330 can pluralize nouns by appending an \u201cs\u201d or \u201ces\u201d and multi-phrase nouns may be pluralized via an apostrophe preceding the morphological ending. In the example above, the morphological variation module 330 supplements the tokenized product (step 530) as follows: <product> <formal-name text=\u201ccamera\u201d\/> <formal-name text=\u201ccameras\u201d\/> <category text=\u201ccanon\u201d\/> <category text=\u201ccanons\u201d\/> <brand text=\u201cdslr\u201d\/> <brand text=\u201cdslrs\u201d\/> <format text=\u201ceos\u201d\/> <sub-family text=\u201c5d mark iii\u201d\/> <sub-family text=\u201c5d mark iii's\u201d\/> <name text=\u201cEOS Canon 5d mark iii\u201d\/> <\/product> This supplemental tokenization permits the NLP system 10 to process a natural language user input or query, such as \u201cHow many canon dslrs have sold?\u201d or \u201cWhich regions buy the most 5d mark iii's?\u201d Once tokenized by tokenizer 310 (step 510) and supplemented by supplemental information sources 320 (step 520) and morphological variation module 330 (step 530), the supplemented tokenization is indexed within the tokenized product index 340 (step 540), which is searchable by the parser 410 of the NLP system 10. The tokenized product index 340 may be stored in memory 28 of the NLP system 10, or remotely in a database or storage device that is accessible by the NLP system 10. FIGS. 4, 6 and 7 illustrate a block diagram of natural language query processing modules 50 executable by processor 16 of the NLP system 10 and a preferred sequence of steps to resolve partial matches in response to a natural language input or query 400 from a user. A natural language user input or query 400 is received by the NLP system 10 for processing (step 600). The user input or query 400 may be in the form of a natural language textual string, which is typically a sentence or phrase. The natural language query processing modules(s) 50 preferably include a NLP parser 410 with associated grammar rules interpreter 420, tokenizer 430, search engine 440 and parse ranker 450, as well as an intelligent Interactive Query Refinement (IQR) module 460 and a partial match resolution module 470. The NLP parser 410 receives the natural language user input or query 400 (step 600). The NLP parser 410 preferably includes a grammar rules interpreter 420, which utilizes grammar rules 405 to interpret the user input 400. The grammar rules attempt to codify and interpret actual grammar rules of the natural language, and may be stored in memory 28 of the NLP system 10 or in a remote location accessible to the parser 410. The NLP parser 410 also includes a tokenizer 430 to tokenize the user input or query 400 (step 610). The tokenizer 430 locates word boundaries in the textual string of the user input or query 400 and segments the textual string into linguistic units (\u201ctokens\u201d), such as words, punctuation, numbers, alpha-numerics, etc. In other words, the tokenizer 430 breaks down the textual string into understandable segments. The tokenizer 430 identifies the words in the user input or query 400, looks them up in a dictionary, makes records for the parts of speech (POS) of the word, and tokenizes each user input or query 400 into a constituent set of tokens, which are passed on to the search engine 440. The search engine 440 of parser 410, in cooperation with the grammar rules interpreter 420, generates multiple grammatically correct parses of the user input 400. The search engine 440 also performs a look up or comparison of the constituent set of tokens received from the tokenizer 430 for matching tokens in the tokenized product index 340 (step 630). The search engine 440 sends its results to the parse ranker 450, which mathematically measures the likelihood that each parse represents the intended meaning of the user input 400 and ranks each parse from most to least likely. In many instances, the NLP parser 410 is able to resolve the tokenized user input or query 400 in step 640 to a precise match with a corresponding token(s) in the tokenized product index 340. In that case, the parse ranker 450 ranks the candidate results (step 650) and the NLP system 10 presents the results 480 to the user in response to the user input 400 (step 660). In the event that the NLP parser 410 is unable to resolve the user input 400 due to ambiguity or in the case of multiple matches, then the intelligent Interactive Query Refinement (IQR) module 350 may optionally cause the NLP system 10 to pose a query 465 back to the user with a possible set of choices. For instance, in the example described above, if the parser 410 received a user input 400 asking \u201cwhat are the most popular cameras?,\u201d the parser 410 might match \u201ccameras\u201d to multiple products in the tokenized product index 340. In that case, the intelligent IQR module 460 may formulate a query 465 based on the user input 400 and cause the NPL system 10 to query the user \u201cWhich cameras are you interested in?\u201d along with a list of possible choices. The user may then make a selection from the list of possible choices and transmit that selection back to the intelligent IQR module 460 for use as the product entity. If the search engine 440 determines that the tokenized user input 400 partially matches multiple items or products indexed in the tokenized product index 340 (partial match tokens) (step 700), the partial match resolution module 470 determines when multiple products are being indicated in the user input 400. The partial match resolution module 470 determines whether the partial match tokens identified from the tokenized user input or query 400 have a sequential break (non-contiguous sequence or matching) (step 710). If so, the non-contiguous sequence of partial match tokens may indicate that the user input or query 400 specifies multiple products. Identification of a non-contiguous sequence of partial match tokens, by itself, cannot guarantee that the user input or query 400 was intended to specify multiple items or products. In the event that the partial match resolution module 470 identifies non-contiguous partial matches within the tokenized user input or query 400 (step 710)C, the partial match resolution module 470 also pulls back or retrieves from the tokenized product index 340 the products or items for each partial match token set (step 720) and performs an intersection against the products or items for each partial match token set (step 730). If the intersection results in no product matches in step 730, then the partial match resolution module 470 identifies the partial match tokens as disjoint and separate, confirming that the user intended the query 400 to refer to multiple items or products (step 750). On the other hand, if the intersection results in at least one product match in step 730, then the partial match resolution module 470 identifies the partial match tokens as non-disjoint, which is indicative of the user input or query 400 referring to a single product (step 760). For example, for the user query 400 \u201cWhat agfa and powershot cameras from canon sold the best?,\u201d the partial match resolution module 470 identifies three partial match tokens with a sequential break (non-contiguous matching) (steps 700, 710). The partial match resolution 470 pulls back or retrieves the products for each token set from the tokenized product index 340 (step 720). \u201cAgfa\u201d would resolve to all product matches that contain the token \u201cagfa\u201d and \u201cpowershot, cameras\u201d would resolve to all product matches that contain the tokens \u201cpowershot\u201d and \u201ccameras.\u201d The partial match resolution module 470 would then perform an intersection against the product matches for \u201cagfa\u201d and \u201cpowershot, cameras\u201d (step 730), which is illustrated in FIG. 8. Because the token sets \u201cagfa\u201d and \u201cpowershot, cameras\u201d are disjoint and separate, resulting in no intersection between the respective token sets (step 740), the partial match resolution module 470 determines that the user intended for the query 400 to refer to multiple products (step 750). In another example, for the user query \u201cWhat 5d mark iii model camera from Canon sold the best?,\u201d the partial match resolution module 470 identifies three non-contiguous partial match tokens (steps 700, 710). The partial match resolution module 470 pulls back the products for each token set from the tokenized product index 340 (step 720). \u201c5D Mark iii\u201d would resolve to all product matches that contain the token \u201c5D Mark iii\u201d; \u201ccamera\u201d would resolve to all product matches that contain the token \u201ccamera\u201d; and \u201cCanon\u201d would resolve to all product matches that contain the token \u201cCanon.\u201d The partial match resolution module 470 would then perform an intersection against the product matches for \u201c5D Mark iii,\u201d \u201ccamera\u201d and \u201cCanon\u201d (step 730), which is illustrated in FIG. 9. Because the token sets \u201c5D Mark iii,\u201d \u201ccamera\u201d and \u201cCanon\u201d are non-disjoint, resulting in a common intersection containing at least one product match (step 740), the partial match resolution 470 determines that the user intended for the query 400 to refer to a single product (step 760).

Reference will now be made in detail to implementations of the present invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The same reference indicators will be used throughout the drawings and the following detailed description to refer to the same or like parts. In the interest of clarity, not all of the standard hardware and routine features of the implementations described herein are shown and described. It will, of course, be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made in order to achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with application- and business-related constraints, and that these specific goals will vary from one implementation to another and from one developer to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of engineering for those of ordinary skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The present invention discloses an electronic interface device using multi-touch actuator mechanisms for a touch panel. In one embodiment, the interface device having a tactile touch panel is capable of providing multiple haptic feedbacks in response to multiple contacts simultaneously. The haptic feedback may also be referred to as tactile effect, tactile feedback, haptic effect, force feedback, or vibrotactile feedback. The tactile touch panel can also be referred to as a haptic touch pad, vibrotactile touch panel, force feedback touch panel, haptic touch panel, or the like. The tactile touch panel, in one embodiment, includes an electrical insulated layer and a tactile layer, wherein the electrical insulated layer includes a top surface and a bottom surface. The top surface of the electrical insulated layer is capable of receiving an input from a user. The tactile layer, which is also known as a haptic layer, a feedback layer, or the like, includes a grid or an array of haptic cells. The top surface of the haptic layer is situated adjacent to the bottom surface of the electrical insulated layer, while the bottom surface of the haptic layer is situated adjacent to a display. Each haptic cell further includes at least one piezoelectric material, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d) element, thermal fluid pocket, MEMS pump, resonant device, variable porosity membrane, laminar flow modulation, or the like. Each haptic cell is configured to provide a haptic effect independent of other haptic cells in the tactile layer. FIG. 1 illustrates an electronic interface device or system 100 capable of providing multiple tactile feedbacks in response to multiple touches substantially simultaneous in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. System 100 includes a touch-sensitive panel or touch panel 102, a display panel 104, and a case 106. Touch-sensitive panel 102, in one embodiment, is made of substantially transparent materials, and is capable of transmitting light so that objects or images displayed in display 104 can be seen through the touch-sensitive panel 102. Display 104 can be any type of display such as a cathode ray tube (\u201cCRT\u201d), liquid crystal display (\u201cLCD\u201d), plasma display, flat panel display, flexible display or the like. Both touch-sensitive panel 102 and display 104 may be installed together with case 106. It should be noted that touch-sensitive panel 102 and display 104 can be integrated into the same unit or device. In an alternative embodiment, display 102 may be removed from system 100 when displaying images are not necessary. For example, a touch pad used on a laptop or on a vehicle dashboard, which does not require displaying images, can be opaque. Touch panel 102, in one embodiment, includes an insulated layer and an array or a grid of haptic cells 120, wherein haptic cells 120 are separated by borders 124. Each of haptic cells 120 is capable of providing a haptic effect in response to an input independent of other haptic cells 120 in touch panel 102. For example, when multiple contacts are depressed on touch panel 102 substantially simultaneously, touch-sensitive panel or touch panel 102 activates haptic cells 120 to generate multiple haptic effects in response to the multiple contacts. It should be noted that the multiple contacts may be made by one finger or multiple fingers. The dimension or size of each of the haptic cells 120 is configured to be less than 5 millimeters\u00d75 millimeters, although other sizes may be used as appropriate. Touch panel 102 accepts a user's selection(s) when one or more cells 120 are contacted, touched or depressed by the user's finger(s). In one embodiment, touch panel 102 rejects a user's selection when a border 124 is touched. Touch panel 102 further includes circuits 110 mounted at the edge or otherwise attached to the panel via a cable or flexible circuit. Circuits 110 are used to provide digital control signals and\/or a power source to haptic cells 120. In one embodiment, case 106 further includes a digital processing unit for data processing. In another embodiment, touch panel 102 is capable of providing a tactile overlay that includes a grid of haptic cells 120 wherein each of the haptic cells 120 is approximately the size of half (\u00bd) a fingertip. Each haptic cell 120 is capable of providing vibrotactile or kinesthetic feedback through a localized strain. In one embodiment, the grid cells can be hexagonal or any other type of two-dimensional (2-D) configurations. Alternatively, it should be noted that the grid of haptic cells 120 does not necessarily cover the entire touch panel surface. The layout of haptic cells 120 can be selectively configured to meet the application's requirements. FIG. 2 illustrates a top view of an interface device 200 illustrating a haptic touch panel 206 having an array or a grid of haptic cells 210 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Referring back to FIG. 2, device 200 further includes circuit blocks 202-204, which are configured to perform various functions such as maintaining power supplies, transmitting control signals, and\/or controlling fluid flow. In one embodiment, device 200 also includes a display, which is placed behind touch panel 206. In one embodiment, touch panel 206 is substantially transparent thereby the images displayed by the display can be viewed through touch panel 206. When the application does not require displaying images, the surface of touch panel 206 is opaque and blocks most of the light from passing through touch panel 206. An array of haptic cells 210 of touch panel 206 is capable of generating haptic effects in response to their control signals. Control signals, in one aspect, are generated in accordance with the inputs received. To provide multiple haptic effects in response to multiple touches, each haptic cell 210 is capable of initiating a haptic effect independent of other haptic cells 210 in touch panel 206. In another embodiment, each of haptic cells 210 of touch panel 206 is capable of generating a unique haptic effect in response to a specific input. A unique haptic effect initiates a specific haptic sensation to a user's input. It should be noted that each cell 210 can be further divided into multiple sub cells wherein each sub cell can generate its own haptic effect. FIG. 3a illustrates a haptic cell 210 using piezoelectric materials to generate haptic effects in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Cell 210 includes an electrical insulated layer 302, a piezoelectric material 304, and wires 306. Electrical insulated layer 302 has a top surface and a bottom surface, wherein the top surface is configured to receive inputs. A grid or an array of piezoelectric materials 304, in one embodiment, is constructed to form a piezoelectric or haptic layer, which also has a top and a bottom surface. The top surface of the piezoelectric layer is situated adjacent to the bottom surface of electrical insulated layer 302. Each cell 210 includes at least one piezoelectric material 304 wherein piezoelectric material 304 is used to generate haptic effects independent of other piezoelectric cells 210 in piezoelectric layer. In one embodiment, multiple adjacent or neighboring cells 210 are capable of generating multiple haptic effects in response to multiple substantially simultaneous touches. In another embodiment, each of cells 210 has a unique piezoelectric material thereby it is capable of initiating a unique haptic sensation. It should be noted that a tactile touch panel, which includes an electrical insulated layer 302 and a piezoelectric layer, in some embodiments further includes a display. This display may be coupled to the bottom surface of the piezoelectric layer and is capable of projecting images that are viewable from the top surface of electrical insulated layer 302. It should be noted that the display can be a flat panel display or a flexible display. Piezoelectric materials 304, in one embodiment, are substantially transparent and small. The dimension of a cell 210 having piezoelectric material can be configured to be less than 5 millimeters by 5 millimeters. The shape of piezoelectric material 304, for example, deforms in response to electrical potentials applied via electrical wires 306. During a manufacturing process, a piezoelectric film is printed to include an array or a grid of piezoelectric cells 210. In one embodiment, a film of cells 210 containing piezoelectric materials is printed on a sheet in a cell grid arrangement. The film further includes wirings for directly addressing every cell 210 in the device using electrical control signals. Cells 210, for example, can be stimulated using edge or back mounted electronics. Piezoelectric materials may include crystals and\/or ceramics such as quartz (SiO2) FIG. 3b illustrates a haptic cell 210 generating haptic effects in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. During operation, when a voltage potential applies to piezoelectric material 305 via wires 306, piezoelectric material 305 deforms from its original shape of piezoelectric material 304, as shown in FIG. 3a, to expanded shape of piezoelectric material 305. Deformation of piezoelectric material 305 causes electrical insulated layer 303 to deform or strain from its original state of layer 302, as shown in FIG. 3a. In an alternative embodiment, piezoelectric materials 305 return to its original state as soon as the voltage potential is removed. It should be noted that the underlying concept of the present invention does not change if additional blocks (circuits or mechanical devices) are added to the device illustrated in FIGS. 3a and 3b. If the piezoelectric material is replaced with other materials such as shape memory alloys (\u201cSMAs\u2019), such material may be capable of maintaining its deformed shape for a period of time after the voltage potential is removed. It should be noted that the underlying concept of the embodiments of the present invention does not change if different materials other than piezoelectric actuators are employed. FIG. 4a is a diagram 400 illustrating another embodiment of a haptic cell 210 using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (\u201cMEMS\u201d) device 402 to generate haptic effects in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Diagram 400 depicts a block 410, which shows a top view of cell 210. Cell 210 includes a MEMS device 402. In one embodiment, MEMS device 402 is substantially transparent thereby the image projection from a display, not shown in FIG. 4a, can be viewed through block 410. It should be noted that each of haptic cells 210 is coupled to at least one wire to facilitate and generate haptic effects. MEMS can be considered as an integration of mechanical devices, sensors, and electronics on a silicon or organic semiconductor substrate, which can be manufactured through conventional microfabrication process. For example, the electronic devices may be manufactured using semiconductor fabrication process and micromechanical devices may be fabricated using compatible microfabrication process. In one embodiment, a grid or an array of MEMS devices 402 are made of multiple cantilever-springs. A grid of cantilever-springs can be etched using MEMS manufacturing techniques. Also, electrical wirings for stimulating or driving cantilever-springs can also be directly etched onto the surface of the MEMS device 402 thereby every single MEMS device can be correctly addressed. MEMS cantilevers can be stimulated using a resonant drive (for vibrotactile) or direct actuation (kinesthetic). In another embodiment, the MEMS are stimulated in response to the energy generated by the display. For example, radio frequency energy, light, or heat generated by the pixels of a plasma display could provide an excitation source or activation signal for a MEMS haptic cell. FIG. 4b illustrates a side view of MEMS device 402, wherein MEMS device 412 can be stimulated or deformed from its original state of MEMS device 402 to deformed state of MEMS device 414 when a voltage potential across MEMS device is applied. Displacement 404 between the original state and the deformed state depends on the composition of materials used and the size of MEMS device 402. Although smaller MEMS devices 402 are easier to fabricate, they offer smaller displacement 404. In one embodiment, cantilever-springs can be made of piezo materials. It should be noted that the actuation of piezo material is generally vibrotactile sensation. It should be further noted that piezo material can be used as a sensor for sensing fingertip positions and depressions. MEMS device 402, in another embodiment, uses shape memory alloy (\u201cSMA\u201d) in place of cantilever-spring as mentioned above. The actuation generated by MEMS device 402 using SMA provides kinesthetic actuation. SMA, also known as memory metal, could be made of copper-zinc-aluminum, copper-aluminum-nickel, nickel-titanium alloys, or a combination of copper-zinc-aluminum, copper-aluminum-nickel, and\/or nickel-titanium alloys. Upon deforming from SMA's original shape, SMA regains its original shape in accordance with an ambient temperature and\/or surrounding environment. It should be noted that the present invention may combine piezoelectric elements, cantilever-spring, and\/or SMA to achieve a specific haptic sensation. FIG. 5a is a side view diagram of an interface device 500 illustrating an array of haptic cells 502 with thermal fluid pockets 504 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Device 500 includes an insulated layer 506, a haptic layer 512, and a display 508. While the top surface of insulated layer 506 is capable of receiving inputs from a user, the bottom surface of insulated layer 506 is placed adjacent to the top surface of haptic layer 512. The bottom surface of haptic layer 512 is placed adjacent to display 508, wherein haptic layer 512 and insulated layer 506 may be substantially transparent thereby objects or images displayed in display 508 can be seen through haptic layer 512 and insulated layer 506. It should be noted that display 508 is not a necessary component in order for the interface device to function. Haptic layer 512, in one embodiment, includes a grid of fluid filled cells 502, which further includes at least one thermal fluid pocket 504 and an associated activating cell 510. It should be noted that each of fluid filled cells 502 can include multiple thermal fluid pockets 504 and associated activating cells 510. In another embodiment, a fluid filled cell 502 includes multiple associated or shared activating cells 510 thereby initiating a different activating cell generates a different haptic sensation(s). Activating cell 510, in one embodiment, is a heater, which is capable of heating an associated thermal fluid pocket 504. Various electrical, optical, and mechanical techniques relating to heating technology can be used to fabricate activating cells 510. For example, various electrically controlled resistors can be used for activating cells 510, wherein resistors can be implanted in haptic layer 512 during the fabrication. Alternatively, optical stimulators such as infrared lasers can be used as activating cells 510 to heat up thermal fluid pockets 504. Optical stimulator, for example, can be mounted at the edge of the interface device. It should be noted that activating cells 510 can be any types of optical or radioactive stimulator as long as it can perform the function of a heating device. Activating cells 510 may also use rear mounted thermal stimulators, which are similar technologies like hot plasma displays such as are commonly found in flat panel plasma televisions. Device 500 further includes a set of control wires, not shown in FIG. 5a, wherein each of activating cells 510 is coupled to at least one pair of wires. The wires are configured to transmit activating\/deactivating control signals, which are used to drive activating cells 510. It should be noted that each of fluid filled cells 502 is addressable using signals from wires or wireless networks. Display 508, in one aspect, can be a flat panel display or a flexible display. In an alternative embodiment, the physical location of display 508 is exchangeable with haptic layer 512. Also, thermal fluid pockets 504, in one embodiment, can be activated by a piezoelectric grid. Thermal fluid pockets 504, in one embodiment, include fluid with physical properties of low specific heat and high thermal expansion. Examples of this fluid include glycerin, ethyl alcohol, or the like. Thermal fluid pockets 504 are capable of producing multiple localized strains in response to multiple touches received by insulated layer 506. Each localized strain is created by a heated thermal fluid pocket 504 wherein the heat is generated by an associated activating cell 510. In one embodiment, a thermal fluid pocket 504 changes its physical shape in accordance with the temperature of the fluid in the pocket. In another embodiment, fluid filled cell 502 has an active cooling system, which is used to restore the expanded shape of thermal fluid pocket 504 to its original shape after it is deactivated. The control of fluid temperature affects haptic bandwidth. Rapid rising of fluid temperature and fast heat dissipation of fluid enhance haptic bandwidth of thermal fluid packets. The physical size of each fluid cell 502 can also affect the performance of the cell for generating haptic sensation(s). For example, if the size of fluid cell 504 is smaller than \u00bd of a fingertip, the performance of cell 504 enhances because smaller cell permits rapid heat dissipation as well as quick temperature rising of fluid in the cell. In another embodiment, thermal plastic pockets filled with plastic fluid are used in place of thermal fluid pockets 504 filled with thermally sensitive fluid to enhance the haptic effects. Using thermal plastic pockets filled with plastic-like fluid can produce high thermal plastic strain. For example, a type of plastic fluid is polyethylene. Thermal plastic pockets can also provide different and unique haptic sensations to the user. In another embodiment, some exotic fluids such as electrorheological and\/or magnetorheological fluid can be used in place of thermal fluid in thermal fluid pockets 504. Thermal fluid pockets 504 filled with electrorheological fluid can be stimulated by a local or remote electrical field, while thermal fluid pockets 504 filled with magnetorheological fluid can be stimulated by a local or remote magnetic field. FIG. 5b is a side view diagram for an interface device 550 illustrating an array of haptic cells 502 using thermal fluid pockets 554 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Device 550 also shows an activated thermal fluid pocket 554 and an activated activating cell 560. During the operation, thermal fluid pocket 554 increases its physical volume (or size) from its original state 556 to expanded thermal fluid pocket 554 when activating cell 560 is activated. When activating cell 560 is activated, it provides heat 562 to thermal fluid pocket 554 or 556 to expand the size of thermal fluid pocket 554 or 556. Due to the expansion of thermal fluid pocket 554, a localized portion 552 of insulated layer 506 is created. As soon as the temperature of the fluid in the thermal fluid pocket 554 cools down, the size of thermal fluid pocket 554 returns to its original state 556. The change of size between original size of a thermal fluid pocket 556 and expanded size of thermal fluid pocket 554 generates a haptic effect. It should be noted that activating cell 560 could be an electric heater or an optical heater such as an infrared simulator. FIG. 6a is a side view diagram of an interface device 600 illustrating an array of MEMS pumps 602 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Diagram 600 includes an insulated layer 606 and a haptic layer 612. While the top surface of insulated layer 606 is configured to receive a touch or touches from a user, the bottom surface of insulated layer 606 is placed adjacent to the top surface of haptic layer 612. The bottom surface of haptic layer 612 is, in one embodiment, placed adjacent to a display (not shown in FIG. 6a), wherein haptic layer 612 and insulated layer 606 may be substantially transparent thereby objects or images displayed in the display can be seen through haptic layer 612 and insulated layer 606. It should be noted that display is not a necessary component in order for the interface device to function. Haptic layer 612, in one embodiment, includes a grid of MEMS pumps 602, which further includes at least one pocket 604. Each MEMS pump 602 includes a pressurized valve 608 and a depressurized valve 610. Pressurized valve 608 is coupled to an inlet tube 614 while depressurized valve 610 is coupled to an outlet tube 616. In one embodiment, inlet tube 614, which is under high liquid pressure, is used to pump liquid through pressurized valve 608 to expand pocket 604. Similarly, outlet tube 616, which is under low pressure, is used to release the liquid through depressurized valve 610 to release the pressure from pocket 604. It should be noted that MEMS pumps 602 can be coupled to the same pressurized liquid reservoir. It should be further noted that pressurized valve 608 and depressurized valve 610 can be combined into one single valve for both inlet tube 614 and outlet tube 616. It should be further noted that inlet tube 614 and outlet tube 616 can also be combined into one tube. A grid of MEMS pumps 602 includes an array of pressurized valves 608 and depressurized valves 610, wherein pressurized valves 608 are coupled with a rear or a side mounted liquid reservoir under pressure while depressurized vales 610 are coupled to a rear or a side mounted depressurized liquid reservoir with low pressure. Valves 608-610 control the filling and emptying the liquid pockets 604 in MEMS pumps 602 to produce localized strain. An advantage of using pressurized liquid reservoir is to quickly deform the surface of insulated layer 606 and to maintain the deformation with minimal or no energy consumption (or expenditure). It should be noted that MEMS pump 602 can also use pressurized air or other gases to achieve similar results as liquid. Device 600 further includes a set of control wires 617-618, which can be used to control pressurized valve 608 and depressurized valve 610, respectively. It should be noted that each valve in haptic layer 612 is addressable using electrical signals transmitted from wires or wireless network. FIG. 6b illustrates two diagrams of an interface device 620 and 650 having an array of MEMS pumps 604 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Device 620 illustrates an activated pocket 623, which includes an activated inlet valve 630 and a deactivated outlet valve 632. During an operation, pocket 623 increases its physical volume (or size) from its original state 624 to its expanded pocket 623 when inlet valve 630 is activated. When inlet valve 630 is activated (or open) in response to electrical signal from wire 628, inlet tube 625 pumps liquid 626 from pressurized reservoir to pocket 623. Due to the expansion of pocket 623, a localized strain 622 of insulated layer 606 is created. Device 650 illustrates an activated MEMS pump returns from its expanded state of pocket 623 to the original state of pocket 653. When depressurized valve 660 is activated, depressurized valve 660 releases liquid 656 from pocket 653 to low pressurized outlet 654. It should be noted that depressurized valve 660 is controlled by at least one control signal via wire 658. The changing in volume between original size of pocket 604 and expanded size of pocket 623 generates haptic effects. FIG. 7 illustrates a side view diagram for an interface device 700 having an array of haptic cells 702 using variable porosity membrane 710 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Device 700 includes an insulated layer 706 and a haptic layer 712. While the top surface of insulated layer 706 is configured to receive inputs from a user, the bottom surface of insulated layer 706 is placed adjacent to the top surface of haptic layer 712. The bottom surface of haptic layer 712 is, in one embodiment, placed adjacent to a display (not shown in FIG. 7), wherein haptic layer 712 and insulated layer 706 may be substantially transparent thereby objects or images displayed in the display can be seen through haptic layer 712 and insulated layer 706. It should be noted that display is not a necessary component in order for the interface device to function. Haptic layer 712, in one embodiment, includes a grid of haptic cells 702, inlet valves 703, and outlet valves 704. Haptic cells 702, in one embodiment, are pockets capable of containing fluid. Haptic layer 712 is similar to haptic layer 612 as shown in FIG. 6a except that haptic layer 712 employs porosity membranes. While each inlet valve 703 is controlled by control signal(s) transmitted by wire 713, each outlet valve 704 is controlled by electrical signals transmitted over a wire 714. Every inlet valve 703 or outlet valve 704 employs at least one porosity membrane 710. Porosity membranes 710 are coupled (or face) to a liquid reservoir wherein each membrane 710 is configured to control how much liquid should enter and\/or pass through membrane 710. An advantage of using porosity membranes is to maintain the deformation of insulated layer 706 with minimal or no energy consumption. FIG. 8 is a side view of an interface device 800 having an array of haptic cells 802 using various resonant devices in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Device 800 includes an insulated layer 806 and a haptic layer 812. While the top surface of insulated layer 806 is configured to receive an input from a user, the bottom surface of insulated layer 806 is placed adjacent to the top surface of haptic layer 812. The bottom surface of haptic layer 812 is, in one embodiment, placed adjacent to a display (not shown in FIG. 8), wherein haptic layer 812 and insulated layer 806 may be substantially transparent thereby objects or images displayed in the display can be seen through haptic layer 812 and insulated layer 806. It should be noted that display is not a necessary component in order for the interface device to function. Haptic layer 812, in one embodiment, includes a grid of haptic cells 802, wherein each cell 802 further includes a permanent magnet 804, an electro magnet 810, and two springs 808. Haptic layer 812 is similar to haptic layer 612 shown in FIG. 6a except that haptic layer 812 employs resonant devices while haptic layer 612 uses MEMS pumps. Haptic cell 802, in one embodiment, uses a resonant mechanical retractable device to generate haptic effects. The resonant mechanical retractable device vibrates in response to a unique frequency, which could be generated by a side mounted resonant stimulator 816 or a rear mounted resonant stimulator 814. A resonant grid, in one embodiment, is used to form a haptic layer 812. Each cell 802 is constructed using resonant mechanical elements such as Linear Resonant Actuator (\u201cLRA\u201d) or MEMS springs. Each cell 802, however, is configured to have a slightly different resonant frequency and a high Q (high amplification at resonance and a narrow resonant frequency band). As such, each cell 802 can be stimulated using mechanical pressure waves originating at the edges of the sheet. The haptic effects can also be generated by a piezoelectric or other high bandwidth actuator that induces acoustic waves. Cell 802, in another embodiment, includes one spring 808. In yet another embodiment, cell 802 includes more than two springs 808. Each spring 808 is configured to respond to a specific range of frequencies thereby each spring 808 can produce a unique haptic sensation. FIG. 9a illustrates a top view diagram of a multi-touch haptic display 900 having laminar flow of fluid in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Display 900 includes a fluid inlet reservoir 902, an array of MEMS cells 904, a fluid exit reservoir 906, and a display 908. Fluid inlet reservoir 902 and fluid exit reservoir 906 facilitate and guide laminar flow 910 from fluid inlet reservoir 902 to fluid exit reservoir 906 as indicated by large arrows. Laminar flow 910 is nonturbulent, streamline, or smooth flow of a viscous fluid between layers. It should be noted that laminar flow 910 and MEMS cells 904 may be substantially transparent thereby objects or images displayed in display 908 can be viewed through laminar flows 910 and MEMS cells 904. It, however, should be noted that display 908 is not a necessary component in order for the device to function. Display 900 contains an array of individually addressable MEMS cells or haptic elements 904. MEMS cells 904, also known as MEMS turbulence inducing cells, are used to create multiple asynchronous local haptic effects 912 across the display surface. Each asynchronous local haptic effect 912 occurs when a local turbulence is induced by an associated MEMS cell 914. When a MEMS cell 914 is activated, it produces local turbulent flow and induces a vibration or change of surface film texture of the cell 904, which creates a haptic sensation or effect. When a MEMS cell 904 is deactivated, laminar flow can flow through an associated MEMS cell smoothly without any turbulence. Each MEMS cell 904 can be activated independent of other MEMS cells 904 in display 900. FIG. 9b illustrates a cross-section view diagram of a multi-touch haptic display 950 having laminar flow of fluid in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Display 950 includes a fluid inlet reservoir 902, an array of MEMS cells 904, a fluid exit reservoir 906, a display 908, and a thin flexible transparent membrane 952. As shown in FIG. 9b, smooth laminar fluid flow 954 flows from fluid inlet reservoir 902 to fluid exit reservoir 906 as indicated by many small arrows. MEMS cells 904 includes multiple redundant deformable structures wherein the deformable structures actuate out of the plane of MEMS cell 904 when it is activated. When a MEMS cell 962 is activated, it activates the deformable structures, also known as hairs, which cause a local patch of flowing fluid to transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow 960. Fluid turbulence flow 960 causes local vibration of membrane and creates a localized haptic sensation 958. Each MEMS cell 904 is addressable and can be activated independent of other MEMS cells 904 in display 950. The present invention includes various processing steps, which will be described below. The steps of the present invention may be embodied in machine or computer executable instructions. The instructions can be used to cause a general purpose or special purpose system, which is programmed with the instructions; to perform the steps of the present invention. Alternatively, the steps of the present invention may be performed by specific hardware components that contain hard-wired logic for performing the steps, or by any combination of programmed computer components and custom hardware components. While embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the Internet, the method and apparatus described herein is equally applicable to other network infrastructures or other data communications environments. FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating a process of providing multiple haptic effects in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. At block 1002, a process displays an image, which is viewable through an insulated layer. In one embodiment, the display can be a flat panel screen or a flexible display. Alternative, the process displays an opaque background without any images. Also, the images may be projected onto the insulated layer from the above or below. It should be noted that if the application does not require displaying images, the display is not necessary and may be removed. In an alternative embodiment, the insulated layer is capable of interfacing with users and receiving inputs. After block 1002, the process moves to the next block. At block 1004, the process monitors the insulated layer. In one embodiment, the process identifies the image and the possible inputs can be detected in accordance with the image. The process is capable of monitoring multiple contacts substantially same time. The process proceeds to block 1006. At block 1006, the process detects a first deformation of the insulated layer in response to a first depressing by a first finger. It should be noted that the finger can also be a stylus or any finger-like pointed objects. The process can also detect the first and the second deformations depressed by the same finger. After block 1006, the process moves to the next block. At block 1008, the process detects a second deformation of the insulated layer substantially the same time as the first deformation. The process is also capable of sensing the second deformation in response to a second depressing by a second finger. It should be noted that the second finger can be a stylus or any kind of pointed objects. The process is capable of detecting more deformations of the insulated layer if more depressions or contacts are made. After block 1008, the process moves to the next block. At block 1010, the process generates a first input in accordance with a location of the first deformation and a second input in accordance with a location of the second deformation. The process is capable of generating more inputs if more contacts or depressions are detected. At block 1012, the process activates a first haptic cell with a first haptic effect in response to the first input and a second haptic cell with a second haptic effect in response to the second input. In one embodiment, the process initiates the first haptic effect and the second haptic effect substantially the same time. In another embodiment, the process activates a first piezoelectric material of the first haptic cell to generate the first haptic effect and activates a second piezoelectric material of the second haptic cell to generate the second haptic effect. In another embodiment, the process activates a first MEMS element of the first haptic cell to generate the first haptic effect and activates a second MEMS element of the second haptic cell to generate the second haptic effect. In yet another embodiment, the process activates a first fluid filled pocket of the first haptic cell to generate the first haptic effect and activates a second fluid filled pocket of the second haptic cell to generate the second haptic effect.

Consumers' Asset maintenance and repair records are important to prolong the life of an expensive Asset. Consumers need to have access to these records easily via electronic media when needed to read\/review user manuals, recall documents, and schedule preventive repairs. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This Invention is to create and maintain a central database called Machine Maintenance Records (MMR.) which, tracks all records automatically after initial creation of the data file toy the manufacturer using the Asset's model and serial number on the MMR central database. This file can be accessed by the manufacturer, service providers, and consumer using any computing (Smart phone, Tablet, computer) or electronic platform from the MMR database. The MMR system's additional feature is Smart Communication Protocol (SCP), which is a programmed code added to an Asset Distress Call (MC) chip on the equipment to send distress calls or maintenance reminders via the ADC chip Wi-Fi before a catastrophic failure occurs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION First, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) creates the data file by entering the Model and Serial number of the Asset\/Equipment's. The printed documents that are normally included with the As set\/Equipment are now entered into the electronic database, The maintenance timeline with reminders are also included. This creates the birth record and handling instruction of the Asset\/Equipment into the MMR electronic Database located in MMR central server for the consumer. When the asset\/equipment is purchased by the consumer, these records and instructions are automatically transferred to the end user after registration with full access to the MMR database by the asset\/equipment model and serial number. The information in the MMR database is accessible by the OEM, service providers, end user, or any party authorized by the end user. Additionally, the OEM can post recalls, update patches, technical bulletins, or review repair records of the sold asset to assess warranty issues and design flaws for further improvements on next models; or to apply fixes to existing models. The repair service provider can evaluate the Asset's history such as, repair records, and other services done such as schedule or non-schedule maintenance, repairs, and recalls from the MMR database to provide accurate service. Any work done by the service provider for repair or maintenance gets updated in the central MMR database automatically by the model and serial number when the service provider writes the detail of the work done on the invoice document for payment using the MMR database invoice application. Other critical information such as recall, patch, or service bulletin can be entered by the OEM even after the equipment is in service to the central MMR database for the consumer and service provider to use when needed. The Asset's data are useful during the life of the product for the consumer for keeping track of the health of the equipment. Similarly, this information is very useful to the service provider and OEM during the life of the product for further data analysis on improvement and warranty. Design Advantage: Eliminates paper documents: The MMR system eliminates all paper documents that the OEM provides with the Asset\/Equipment, such as the user manual, warranty documents, and service bulletins. The repair printed documents and invoices that service providers currently provide can also be eliminated, since these information will be entered automatically to the MMR database for consumer access. Currently, these Assets are managed on paper invoices and telephone only. There are no electronic data for the owner records. The maintenance and repair documents and invoice papers given to the Consumer for records keeping most of the time get lost or not available when needed. Few well organized consumers keep tracks of all paper trails or manually enter information in some form of data manning program. Records and reminders are easily accessible: The consumer or service provider has easy access to the records when needed by connecting to the internet via smartphone, tablet, or a computer using the MMR application. The smart MMR application with an ADC (Asset Distress Call) chip sends reminders to consumers for scheduled maintenance service or repairs generated from the equipment's internal sensors. The data is communicated via consumer's Wi-Fi connected internet network or via Bluetooth Wireless (BTW) communication protocol connected to end user smartphone to the MMR central database to issue reminders. Market on repair services: In addition to sending reminders for repair and maintenance, the smart MMR also automatically shops for the best priced service and notifies the end user. It can even set up a service schedule between the service facility and the end user at a competitive negotiated price once the end user approves to such search. Tracking: The MMR central electronic Database application, with customize data entry form will eliminate paper trail. All information for specific equipment by Equipment Model, serial number, purchase date, user manual, preventative maintenance, repair records, recall records. Patch etc. will be available in the MMR database acquisition system. These data always remain in the database until the life of the Assets\/Equipment and are transferable to new owner. Additionally, Service or maintenance center, consumer and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) will have access to the same database when needed. This eliminates any manual data entering and duplication and eliminates paper documents. MMR System in Operation: The MMR system is operated by the following method. (Refer to FIG. 1 of the MMR SYSTEM WORKING FLOW CHART DRAWING) Input (1), (2), (3), and (4) shown in FIG. 1 are listed below. MMR Central Server is denoted as (5). All the inputs are stored in (5). FIG. 1 (1) Every Asset\/Equipment manufactured has unique Model and Serial number. OEM creates a file by Asset\/Equipment Model and Serial number on the MMR central database (5), providing the necessary information (user manual, warranty records, etc.) and suggested maintenance timeline and reminders. FIG. 1 (2) At the time of purchase Consumer information's are also added to (5). Access is granted to MMR central database (5) during consumer registration or at the time of purchase. FIG. 1 (3) When the Asset\/Equipment is taken for Service. The service provider generates billing invoice describing the work done on the service provider's computer using the MMR application. The service provider computer connects to the MMR central database (5) and saves the service work done. This record are permanent records in the MMR central database (5) for later reviewing when needed, FIG. 1 (4) Asset Distress Call (ADC) chip can send distress signals in the event of any equipment malfunction to MMR Central database (5) to notify equipment owner on the problem for further inquiry. The output is denoted by FIG. 1 (6). This is where data are reviewed\/accessed by the service providers, consumers and OEM on PC, Laptop, Tablet or Smartphone using MMR Application on the device, to review and analyze data for service, recall, warranty, design issues, upgrade, improvements, repair records and scheduling repairs, Alternate Applications of MMR System 1.

As used herein, the term \u201csample\u201d refers to anything which may contain an analyte for which an analyte assay is desired. In many cases, the analyte is a cf nucleic acid molecule, such as a DNA or cDNA molecule encoding all or part of BRAF. The sample may be a biological sample, such as a biological fluid or a biological tissue. Examples of biological fluids include urine, blood, plasma, serum, saliva, semen, stool, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, tears, mucus, amniotic fluid or the like. Biological tissues are aggregates of cells, usually of a particular kind together with their intercellular substance that form one of the structural materials of a human, animal, plant, bacterial, fungal or viral structure, including connective, epithelium, muscle and nerve tissues. Examples of biological tissues also include organs, tumors, lymph nodes, arteries and individual cell(s). As used herein, a \u201cpatient\u201d includes a mammal. The mammal can be e.g., any mammal, e.g., a human, primate, bird, mouse, rat, fowl, dog, cat, cow, horse, goat, camel, sheep or a pig. In many cases, the mammal is a human being. The present invention is based in part on the discovery that responsiveness to a cancer treatment, or overall survival, can be determined by quantitatively or semi-quantitatively measuring a gene mutation associated with the cancer by measuring nucleic acids, for example cell free (cf) DNA or circulating tumor (ct) DNA, in a bodily fluid at various time points over the course of the treatment. This determination can be made long (weeks or months) before such determinations can be made by conventional means, e.g., radiologically. Thus, in some embodiments, a method of determining responsiveness to a treatment, or overall survival, in a patient with a cancer undergoing the treatment is provided, where the cancer is associated with a gene mutation. The method comprises (a) obtaining a baseline sample of a bodily fluid, wherein the baseline sample was taken from the patient at the start of the treatment; (b) quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining the amount of the mutation in cell free DNA (cfDNA) in the baseline sample; (c) obtaining a second sample of the bodily fluid, wherein the second sample was taken from the patient within about one month after the start of the treatment; (d) quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining the amount of the mutation in cell free DNA (cfDNA) in the second sample; and (e) determining the responsiveness to the treatment by evaluating the results obtained in step (b) and\/or step (d) by a predetermined criteria. The steps (a)-(e) need not be performed in that order. For example, the baseline sample and second sample could be obtained (steps (a) and (c)) before the respective determining steps (steps (b) and (d)). The second sample can be taken from the patient any time within about one month after the start of the treatment, for example, four weeks, three weeks, two weeks, one week, less than one week, or any time in between. In some embodiments, the second sample is taken from the patient at about two weeks after the start of the treatment. As shown in the Examples, determination of the mutant levels in the baseline sample and in a second sample taken at that time, allows an accurate determination of the responsiveness to the treatment. This allows for the determination of responsiveness much earlier than can be made using more conventional methods, for example by visualizing tumor shrinkage using radiography, computed tomography (CT) scanning, positron emission tomography (PET), or PET\/CT scanning. In various embodiments, a decrease in the mutant levels after two weeks indicates responsiveness. The rapid determination of responsiveness to treatment can be particularly useful in clinical trials, where the determination of responsiveness provides an early assessment of drug efficiency in a population of patients. This allows a more rapid assessment of the drug efficacy than was previously possible. As further shown in the Examples, a lower level of the mutation in the baseline sample and\/or the second sample indicate a longer overall survival than higher mutation levels. In these embodiments, the predetermined criteria is established by comparing treatment outcomes with the amount of the mutation in baseline samples and\/or second samples in previous cancer patients. Any bodily fluid that would be expected to have DNA can be utilized in these methods. Non-limiting examples of bodily fluids include, but are not limited to, peripheral blood, serum, plasma, urine, lymph fluid, amniotic fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. In certain particular embodiments, such as those illustrated in the Examples, the bodily fluid is serum, plasma or urine. In some cases, the method is performed quantitatively, such that the amount of the gene alteration is quantitatively determined and may be quantitatively compared to another measurement. In other cases, the method is performed semi-quantitatively, such that the amount of the gene alteration may be determined and then compared to another measurement simply to determine a relative increase or decrease relative to each other. These methods are not narrowly limited to any particular gene mutations in any particular cancer, since levels of any mutation that is associated with any cancer would be expected to be accurately determined by these methods. Nonlimiting examples of such genes are an ABL1, BRAF, CHEK1, FANCC, GATA3, JAK2, MITF, PDCD1LG2, RBM10, STAT4, ABL2, BRCA1, CHEK2, FANCD2, GATA4, JAK3, MLH1, PDGFRA, RET, STK11, ACVR1B, BRCA2, CIC, FANCE, GATA6, JUN, MPL, PDGFRB, RICTOR, SUFU, AKT1, BRD4, CREBBP, FANCF, GID4(C17orf39), KAT6A (MYST3), MRE11A, PDK1, RNF43, SYK, AKT2, BRIP1, CRKL, FANCG, GLI1, KDM5A, MSH2, PIK3C2B, ROS1, TAF1, AKT3, BTG1, CRLF2, FANCL, GNA11, KDM5C, MSH6, PIK3CA, RPTOR, TBX3, ALK, BTK, CSF1R, FAS, GNA13, KDM6A, MTOR, PIK3CB, RUNX1, TERC, AMER1 (FAM123B), C11orf30 (EMSY), CTCF, FAT1, GNAQ, KDR, MUTYH, PIK3CG, RUNX1T1, TERT promoter, APC, CARD11, CTNNA1, FBXW7, GNAS, KEAP1, MYC, PIK3R1, SDHA, TET2, AR, CBFB, CTNNB1, FGF10, GPR124, KEL, MYCL (MYCL1), PIK3R2, SDHB, TGFBR2, ARAF, CBL, CUL3, FGF14, GRIN2A, KIT, MYCN, PLCG2, SDHC, TNFAIP3, ARFRP1, CCND1, CYLD, FGF19, GRM,3 KLHL6, MYD88, PMS2, SDHD, TNFRSF14, ARID1A, CCND2, DAXX, FGF23, GSK3B, KMT2A (MLL), NF1, POLD1, SETD2, TOP1, ARID1B, CCND3, DDR2, FGF3, H3F3A, KMT2C (MLL3), NF2, POLE, SF3B1, TOP2A, ARID2, CCNE1, DICER1, FGF4, HGF, KMT2D (MLL2), NFE2L2, PPP2R1A, SLIT2, TP53, ASXL1, CD274, DNMT3A, FGF6, HNF1A, KRAS, NFKBIA, PRDM1, SMAD2, TSC1, ATM, CD79A, DOT1L, FGFR1, HRAS, LMO1, NKX2-1, PREX2, SMAD3, TSC2, ATR, CD79B, EGFR, FGFR2, HSD3B1, LRP1B, NOTCH1, PRKAR1A, SMAD4, TSHR, ATRX, CDC73, EP300, FGFR3, HSP9OAA1, LYN, NOTCH2, PRKCI, SMARCA4, U2AF1, AURKA, CDH1, EPHA3, FGFR4, IDH1, LZTR1, NOTCH3, PRKDC, SMARCB1, VEGFA, AURKB, CDK12, EPHA5, FH, IDH2, MAGI2, NPM1, PRSS8, SMO, VHL, AXIN1, CDK4, EPHA7, FLCN, IGF1R, MAP2K1, NRAS, PTCH1, SNCAIP, WISP3, AXL, CDK6, EPHB1, FLT1, IGF2, MAP2K2, NSD1, PTEN, SOCS1, WT1, BAP1, CDK8, ERBB2, FLT3, IKBKE, MAP2K4, NTRK1, PTPN11, SOX10, XPO1, BARD1, CDKN1A, ERBB3, FLT4, IKZF1, MAP3K1, NTRK2, QKI, SOX2, ZBTB2, BCL2, CDKN1B, ERBB4, FOXL2, IL7R, MCL1, NTRK3, RAC1, SOX9, ZNF217, BCL2L1, CDKN2A, ERG, FOXP1, INHBA, MDM2, NUP93, RAD50, SPEN, ZNF703, BCL2L2, CDKN2B, ERRFI1, FRS2, INPP4B, MDM4, PAK3, RAD51, SPOP, BCL6, CDKN2C, ESR1, FUBP1, IRF2, MED12, PALB2, RAF1, SPTA1, BCOR, CEBPA, EZH2, GABRA6, IRF4, MEF2B, PARK2, RANBP2, SRC, BCORL1, CHD2, FAM46C, GATA1, IRS2, MEN1, PAX5, RARA, STAG2, BLM, CHD4, FANCA, GATA2, JAK1, MET, PBRM1, RB1, or STAT3 gene. In some embodiments, the mutation is in a BRAF gene or a KRAS gene. Exemplary mutations in those genes are BRAF V600E and the KRAS mutations G12A, G12C, G12D, G12R, G12S, G12V and G13D. An association with BRAF V600E has been reported for various human neoplasms, including melanomas (\u221250%) (Davies et al., 2002; Curtin et al., 2005), papillary thyroid carcinomas (\u221240%) (Puxeddu et al., 2004), Langherans cell histiocytosis (57%) (Badalian-Very et al., 2010) and a variety of solid tumors (at lower frequency)(Davies et al., 2002; Brose et al., 2002; Tie et al., 2011). A member of the serine\/threonine kinase RAF family, the BRAF protein is part of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway that plays a major role in regulating cell survival, proliferation and differentiation (Keshet and Seger, 2010). BRAF mutations constitutively activate the MEK-ERK pathway, leading to enhanced cell proliferation, survival and ultimately, neoplastic transformation (Wellbrock and Hurlstone, 2010; Niault and Baccarini, 2010). All BRAF mutated hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cases carried the V600E phospho-mimetic substitution which occurs within the BRAF activation segment and markedly enhances its kinase activity in a constitutive manner (Wan et al., 2004). Non-limiting examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, adrenal cortical cancer, anal cancer, bile duct cancer, bladder cancer, bone cancer, brain or a nervous system cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, Ewing family of tumor, eye cancer, gallbladder cancer, gastrointestinal carcinoid cancer, gastrointestinal stromal cancer, Hodgkin Disease, intestinal cancer, Kaposi Sarcoma, kidney cancer, large intestine cancer, laryngeal cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer, leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), non-HCL lymphoid malignancy (hairy cell variant, splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (SDRPSBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia, low grade lymphoma, systemic mastocytosis, or splenic lymphoma\/leukemia unclassifiable (SLLU)), liver cancer, lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, lung carcinoid tumor, lymphoma, lymphoma of the skin, malignant mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, nasal cavity cancer, paranasal sinus cancer, nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, oral cavity cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, penile cancer, pituitary tumor, prostate cancer, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, salivary gland cancer, sarcoma, adult soft tissue sarcoma, skin cancer, basal cell skin cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, basal and squamous cell skin cancer, melanoma, stomach cancer, small intestine cancer, testicular cancer, thymus cancer, thyroid cancer, uterine sarcoma, uterine cancer, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, and Wilms Tumor. Non-limiting examples of non-HCL lymphoid malignancy include, but are not limited to, hairy cell variant (HCL-v), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (SDRPSBCL), splenic leukemia\/lymphoma unclassifiable (SLLU), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia, low grade lymphoma, systemic mastocytosis, and splenic lymphoma\/leukemia unclassifiable (SLLU). In certain embodiments of these methods, overall survival is determined in a patient with pancreatic cancer, for example where the gene mutation is a KRAS codon 12 or codon 13 mutation. As shown in Example 7, overall survival determination is improved by determining CA 19-9 antigen levels. In various embodiments, results from both the baseline sample and the second sample are evaluated. In other embodiments of these methods, responsiveness to treatment for colorectal cancer is determined by evaluating results from both the baseline sample and the second sample. In these embodiments, a reduction in levels of the mutation indicates responsiveness. In some embodiments, the colorectal cancer is metastatic colorectal cancer; in various embodiments, the gene mutation is a KRAS codon 12 or 13 mutation. In various embodiments of the methods described herein, the patients are humans. The patients may be of any age, including, but not limited to infants, toddlers, children, minors, adults, seniors, and elderly individuals. In any of the methods described herein, the mutation can be determined, or quantified, by any method known in the art. Nonlimiting examples include MALDI-TOF, HR-melting, di-deoxy-sequencing, single-molecule sequencing, use of probes, pyrosequencing, second generation high-throughput sequencing, SSCP, RFLP, dHPLC, CCM, or methods utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), e.g., digital PCR, quantitative-PCR, or allele-specific PCR (where the primer or probe is complementary to the variable gene sequence). In some embodiments, the PCR is droplet digital PCR, e.g., as described in the Examples. In some of these methods, the mutation is quantified along with the wildtype sequence, to determine the percentage of mutated sequence. In other methods, only the mutation is quantified. In many embodiments, the DNA is cell free DNA (\u201ccfDNA\u201d), or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which may include DNA from cells. In some embodiments, the amplified or detected DNA molecule is genomic DNA. In other embodiments, the amplified or detected molecule is a cDNA. The skilled artisan can determine useful primers for PCR amplification of any mutant sequence for any of the methods described herein. In some embodiments, the PCR amplifies a sequence of less than about 50 nucleotides, e.g., as described in US Patent Application Publication US\/2010\/0068711. In other embodiments, the PCR is performed using a blocking oligonucleotide that suppresses amplification of a wildtype version of the gene, e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 1 (see also Example 1 below) or as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,623,603 or U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62\/039,905. In many embodiments, one or more primers contains an exogenous or heterologous sequence (such as an adapter or \u201ctag\u201d sequence), as is known in the art, such that the resulting amplified molecule has a sequence that is not naturally occurring. The detection limits for the presence of a gene alteration (mutation) in cf nucleic acids may be determined by assessing data from one or more negative controls (e.g. from healthy control subjects or verified cell lines) and a plurality of patient samples. Optionally, the limits may be determined based in part on minimizing the percentage of false negatives as being more important than minimizing false positives. One set of non-limiting thresholds for is defined as less than about 0.05% of the mutation in a sample of cf nucleic acids for a determination of no mutant present or wild-type only; the range of about 0.05% to about 0.107% as \u201cborderline\u201d, and greater than about 0.107% as detected mutation. In other embodiments, a no-detection designation threshold for the mutation is set at less than about 0.1%, less than about 0.15%, less than about 0.2%, less than about 0.3%, less than about 0.4%, less than about 0.5%, less than about 0.6%, less than about 0.7%, less than about 0.8%, less than about 0.9%, or less than about 1% detection of the mutation relative to a corresponding wildtype sequence. A borderline designation can also be set according to any criteria, including the relative amount of false positives and false negatives desired. Of course the inclusion of additional patient samples may result in the determination of different threshold values for each category, or alternatively the elimination of the \u201cborderline\u201d category. The desired amount of false negatives to false positives will also have an effect on the threshold value. The \u201cobtaining\u201d and \u201cdetermining\u201d steps of these methods can be repeated as many times as necessary to obtain sufficient data to assist in determining treatment options, overall survival, or the effectiveness of the treatment being applied. In some embodiments, these steps are performed weekly, monthly, every two months, every three months, every four months, or any interval in between those time points. In some embodiments, the patient has not previously undergone testing for the mutation in the gene. In those situations, the method are used to determine whether a specific mutation is involved in the cancer, and whether a medicament that targets the product of the gene having the mutation could be effective. For example, where a BRAF V600E mutation is present, the patient might be treated with a BRAF inhibitor such as vemurafenib, sorafenib or dabrafenib. In some embodiments, the patient has been previously tested and a mutation determined, and the subsequent tests are to evaluate the progression of the disease and\/or the effectiveness of treatment. In some cases, the detecting may identify the non-responsiveness to a treatment or therapy, and the selecting and\/or applying comprises a different treatment or therapy. In other cases, the detecting may identify the responsiveness to a treatment or therapy, and the selecting and\/or applying comprises continuation of the same treatment or therapy. In additional embodiments, the monitoring is a surveillance of patients, e.g., treated patients deemed \u201cdisease free\u201d where there is a chance of recurrence. Thus, these methods may be used to confirm the maintenance of a disclosed treatment or therapy against various diseases including cancer; or to change the treatment or therapy against the disease. In that context, a method of selecting and\/or applying treatment or therapy for a subject is also provided herein. The method comprises monitoring a gene mutation by the above method, and selecting and\/or applying a treatment or therapy based on the detecting. In some embodiments of these methods, the method identifies low responsiveness or non-responsiveness to a treatment or therapy, and the selecting and\/or applying comprises a different treatment or therapy. In other embodiments, the method identifies effective treatment or therapy, and the selecting and\/or applying comprises continuing the same treatment or therapy. In additional embodiments, the method identifies elimination of the mutation and the selecting and\/or applying comprises discontinuing treatment. Within the scope of changing treatment or therapy, the disclosure includes increasing the treatment or therapy; reducing the treatment or therapy, optionally to the point of terminating the treatment or therapy; terminating the treatment or therapy with the start of another treatment or therapy; and adjusting the treatment or therapy as non-limiting examples. Non-limiting examples of adjusting the treatment or therapy include reducing or increasing the therapy, optionally in combination with one or more additional treatments or therapies; or maintaining the treatment or therapy while adding one or more additional treatments or therapies. In some cases, the observation of cell-free (cf) nucleic acids identifies an increase in the levels of cf nucleic acids containing the mutation following the start of a treatment or therapy. Following the increase, the observation may reach an inflection point, where the levels decrease, or continue to increase. The presence of an inflection point may be used to determine responsiveness to the treatment or therapy, which may be maintained or reduced. A continuing decrease in the levels to be the same as, or lower than, the levels before the start of treatment of therapy is a further confirmation of responsiveness. The absence of an inflection point indicates resistance to the treatment or therapy and so may be followed by terminating administration of the treatment or therapy, or administering at least one additional treatment or therapy against the disease or disorder to the patient, reducing the treatment of the subject with the treatment or therapy and administering at least one additional treatment or therapy against the disease or disorder to the subject. In other cases, and following an inflection point and a decrease in levels, an additional inflection point may be observed. This may indicate the development of resistance to the treatment or therapy and be followed by terminating administration of the treatment or therapy, or administering at least one additional treatment or therapy against the disease or disorder to the subject, or reducing the treatment of the subject with the therapy and administering at least one additional therapy against the disease or disorder to the subject. In some aspects, the method is accompanied by a conventional determination of the tumor burden, e.g., by radiography, computed tomography (CT) scanning, positron emission tomography (PET), or PET\/CT scanning, and comparing the determined amount of mutation to the tumor burden. This is useful to determine whether, or confirm that, the mutation being monitored is actually the driver of the tumor. In other aspects, the determined amount of mutation is not compared to tumor burden, either at one, more than one, or all the mutation monitoring times. Given the reliability of the mutation monitoring procedures described herein, a tumor burden assessment need not be made at each time point, thus saving the patient a tumor burden assessment. In additional aspects, the monitoring comprises evaluating a mutation that is associated with a time-to-failure parameter (i.e., the treatment directed to the mutation is known to fail after a certain period of effectiveness). In these aspects, the monitoring can assist in more accurately predicting when failure will occur, for example when the concentration of the mutation increases over a previous assessment. Treatments and therapies of the disclosure include all modalities of cancer therapy. Non-limiting examples of these modalities include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, and surgery. Non-limiting examples of radiation therapy include external beam radiation therapy, such as with photons (gamma radiation), electrons, or protons; stereotactic radiation therapy, such as with a single high dose or multiple fractionated doses to a small target; brachytherapy; and systemic radioactive isotopes. Non-limiting examples of chemotherapy include cytotoxic drugs; antimetabolites, such as folate antagonists, purine antagonists, and pyrimidine antagonists; biological response modifiers, such as interferons; DNA damaging agents, such as bleomycin; DNA alkylating and cross-linking agents, such as nitrosourea and bendamustine; enzymatic activities, such as asparaginase; hormone antagonists, such as fulvestrant and tamoxifen; aromatase inhibitors; monoclonal antibodies; antibiotics such as mitomycin; platinum complexes such as cisplatin and carboplatin; proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib; spindle poison such as taxanes or vincas or derivatives of either; topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, such as anthracyclines, camptothecins, and podophyllotoxins; tyrosine kinase inhibitors; anti-angiogenesis drugs; and signal transduction inhibitors. Non-limiting examples of hormonal therapy include hormone antagonist therapy, hormone ablation, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, tamoxifen, letrozole, abiraterone, prednisone, or other glucocorticosteroid. Non-limiting examples of immunotherapy include anti-cancer vaccines and modified lymphocytes. In some cases, the maintenance of, or change in, treatment or therapy is within one of these modalities. In other cases, the maintenance of, or change in, treatment or therapy is between two or more of these modalities. Of course a skilled clinician is aware of the recognized and approved treatments and therapies for a given disorder or disease, such as a particular cancer or tumor type, and so the maintenance of, or change in, treatment or therapy may be within those known for the disease or disorder. The present disclosure also provides, in part, a kit for performing the disclosed methods. The kit may include a specific binding agent that selectively binds to a BRAF mutation, and instructions for carrying out the method as described herein. One skilled in the art may refer to general reference texts for detailed descriptions of known techniques discussed herein or equivalent techniques. These texts include Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. (2005); Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (3rd edition), Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.

These texts can, of course, also be referred to in making or using an aspect of the disclosure. Preferred embodiments are described in the following examples. Other embodiments within the scope of the claims herein will be apparent to one skilled in the art from consideration of the specification or practice of the invention as disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification, together with the examples, be considered exemplary only, with the scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the claims, which follow the examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 Materials and Methods The following methods were utilized in the examples that follow. Patient Urine Samples A total of 27 patients with metastasized cancers, whose tumor samples were previously tested for mutations in BRAF (20 patients) and KRAS (7 patients) by a CLIA-certified laboratory, were prospectively enrolled. Single or multiple sequential urine samples (90-110 ml or 24 hour urine collection) for cfDNA mutation analysis were obtained at baseline and during therapy and post-therapy. Two-Step Assay Design A two-step assay design was developed for a 28-30 basepair footprint in the target mutant gene sequence. This assay design (and other assays known in the art) is useful for amplifying any size sequence in various tissues or bodily fluids, for example less than 400, less than 300, less than 200, less than 150 bp, less than 100 bp, less than 50 bp, less than 40 bp, less than 35 bp, or less than 30 bp. FIG. 1 summarizes the assay design, which includes a first pre-amplification step to increase the number of copies of a target mutant gene sequence relative to wild-type gene sequences that are present in the sample. The pre-amplification is conducted in the presence of a wild-type (non-mutant) suppressing \u201cWT blocker\u201d oligonucleotide that is complementary to the wild-type sequence (but not the mutant sequence) to decrease amplification of wild-type DNA. The pre-amplification is performed with primers that include adapters (or \u201ctags\u201d) at the 5\u2032 end to facilitate amplification in the second step. The second step is additional amplification with primers complementary to the tags on the ends of the primers used in the first step and a TaqMan (reporter) probe oligonucleotide complementary to the mutant sequence for quantitative, digital droplet PCR. Assay Development Cell lines with respective mutations (BRAF V600E, KRAS G12D, or KRAS G12V) were used as positive controls. Cell lines confirmed as wildtype BRAF and KRAS were used as negative controls. See FIG. 2. Thresholds for mutation detection were determined by assessing data from 50 healthy controls and 39 patient samples using a classification tree. Minimizing the percentage of false negatives was given a higher importance than minimizing false positives. A set of non-limiting thresholds for BRAF V600E were defined: <0.05% as no detection or wild-type; the range of 0.05% to 0.107% as \u201cborderline\u201d, and >0.107% as detected mutation. A count of KRAS G12 mutations per sample was used as a non-limiting means to confirm CLIA-identified G12 healthy (wild-type) and G12 mutation samples: <234 mutant fragments as wild-type; and 489-2825 mutant fragments as detected mutation. Example 2 BRAF V600E Mutations in cfDNA The sensitivity of the two-step assay was first assessed in urine samples from 19 patients with cancers identified as having a BRAF V600E mutation by a CLIA laboratory. The agreement rate of CLIA V600E to urinary cfDNA V600E mutation and \u201cborderline\u201d was 95% as shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Urinary cfDNA BRAF Tumor type and patient no.

Further concordance of the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation in tissue (by a CLIA laboratory) to urinary cfDNA V600E mutation was observed with both baseline urine samples (before treatment) and any assessed point of urine sample. Those results are provided in Table 2 and 3. TABLE 2 Concordance of BRAF V600E Tissue (CLIA) to Baseline Urine cfDNA Tested (N = 33) BRAF Mutation Urine BRAF Wild Type Urine BRAF Mutation CLIA 25 7 BRAF Wild Type CLIA 0 0 Observed Agreements 25 (76%) TABLE 3 Concordance of BRAF V600E Tissue (CLIA) to Any Assessed Point of Urine cfDNA BRAF BRAF Wild Tested (N-33) Mutation Urine Type Urine BRAF Mutation CLIA 31 2 BRAF Wild Type CLIA 0 0 Observed Agreements 31 (94%) Additionally, cfDNA with the BRAF V600E mutation correlates with its presence in tissue samples from advanced cancer patients, as shown in Table 4. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in the urine of patients with colorectal, NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer), ovarian, melanoma, papillary thyroid cancers and other cancers. The disclosed V600E assay demonstrated high concordance in comparison to tissue biopsies (88% detected in urine at any time point tested; 29 of 33 subjects).

The results are shown in FIG. 8, which illustrates the high concordance between all three sample types. Example 4 Longitudinal Assessment of cfDNA Mutations In three patients a series of multiple urine samples obtained over time was assayed as described above. The patients were afflicted with metastatic melanoma (treated with a BRAF inhibitor and chemotherapy), metastatic colorectal cancer (treated with a BRAF inhibitor and an anti-EGFR antibody), and appendiceal cancer (treated with a BRAF inhibitor and a kinase inhibitor). The results for the melanoma patient are shown in FIG. 3. A signal of 37.9% was observed in the patient's initial sample, followed by the start of therapy. The subsequent four samples had values of 0.08%, 0.83%, 0.17%, and 0.04%. After termination of treatment, the observed levels of the BRAF V600E mutation in urinary cfDNA remained low. The results for the colorectal cancer patient are shown in FIG. 4. A signal of 1.49% was observed in the patient's initial sample, followed by the start of therapy. The subsequent four samples had values of 0.09%, 0.00%, 0.00%, and 0.00%. After termination of treatment, the observed levels of the BRAF V600E mutation in urinary cfDNA remained low and then began to increase. The results for the appendiceal patient are shown in FIG. 5. A signal of 3.43% was observed in the patient's initial sample which was concurrent with therapy. The subsequent two samples had values of 0.45% and 0.02%. In a fourth and fifth patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, resistance to a BRAF inhibitor was observed during treatment of one patient (FIG. 6). The increase in BRAF V600E mutation in urinary cfDNA urinary was similar to that of an untreated patient (FIG. 7). In total, longitudinal analysis of BRAF V600E in 17 of 32 metastatic cancer patients was performed by testing serially collected urine. The dynamics of urinary cell-free BRAF V600E correlated with responsiveness (or lack of response) to therapy in 13 of 17 advanced cancer patients (76%). Example 5 Monitoring Presence of BRAF V600E Mutation Vs. Treatment Response In 15 of 17 metastatic cancer patients that were positive for BRAF V600E cfDNA in urine, the BRAF V600E cfDNA (or ctDNA, circulating tumor DNA) in urine was evaluated over time to monitor disease progression and\/or responsiveness to therapy. As shown in FIG. 9, the monitoring has clinical utility for tracking the therapeutic efficacy of targeted therapy in metastatic cancer patients with detectable BRAF V600E cfDNA or ctDNA. Example 6 Monitoring ctDNA KRAS for Response to Chemotherapy Example Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Despite advances in early detection, each year more than 50,000 patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease. Combination chemotherapy, targeted drugs, and surgical interventions have revolutionized the treatment landscape and improved survival of these patients. Clonal evolution is considered a major cause of drug resistance and non-invasive strategies to detect new and evolving mutations can impact the delivery of personalized treatment. Moreover, non-invasive techniques have the potential to transform the standard of response assessment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and reduce the need for imaging in the management of CRC. Study Design This example provides an interim analysis of 4 metastatic CRC patients with positive KRAS tissue status. Three of the patients had metastases in the liver, the fourth patient had metastases in the lung. The patients were monitored for KRAS ctDNA during chemotherapy. All four patients were on FOLFOX treatment; two had surgical intervention. Urine was collected every two weeks on treatment (x6), and with each radiologic scan (at 6-8 weeks). Urinary ctDNA was extracted using a Trovagene platform that preferentially isolates small fragmented DNA. Highly sensitive, quantitative mutation enrichment PCR-NGS (MiSeq) assay was used for the detection of KRAS codon 12\/13 mutations in the highly fragmented ctDNA. For greater sensitivity in fragmented ctDNA, the assay utilizes a 31 bp footprint. A selective enrichment step for mutated DNA fragments suppresses wild-type (WT) sequence amplification with a blocker. Barcoded adaptor primers are added for compatibility with next generation sequencing (MiSeq). Results The dynamics of urinary ctDNA KRAS G12\/13 mutational load correlated with clinical course in mCRC patients. A decrease in urine ctDNA KRAS G12\/13 mutation levels after 2 weeks of chemotherapy detected the molecular response in advance of radiographic response. In one patient (Patient 1), radiographic progression was detected 3 months after rising ctDNA KRAS mutation was observed in urine. Conclusions Based on the above results, it is clear that the ctDNA KRAS G12\/13 assay can be used to guide treatment decisions in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Example 7 Monitoring KRAS in Pancreatic Cancer Background The overall survival (OS) time of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer (PC) varies widely. Diagnostic tools are presently lacking to predict patient outcome. The vast majority of pancreatic tumors harbor KRAS mutations, which can be detected in circulating tumor (ct)DNA. Study Aim The aim of this prospective study with retrospectively analyzed samples was to evaluate the utility of baseline and serial measurements of KRAS mutation load in ctDNA, alone or in combination with CA-19-9, as an outcome predictive marker in locally advanced and metastatic PC patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy. Clinical Study Design A prospective study of archived samples from 182 patients with non-resectable, locally advanced or metastatic PC undergoing treatment with chemotherapy (Danish BIOPAC study) was performed. FIG. 10 is a graphic of the study design. Patient demographics: 84 females and 92 males, median age 68, range 45-89 years. Locally advanced (n=50) or metastatic (n=132) pancreatic cancer. Palliative treatment was with gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX. Methodology Highly sensitive, quantitative mutation enrichment PCR-NGS (MiSeq) assay was used for the detection of KRAS codon 12\/13 mutations in highly fragmented plasma ctDNA. The Lower Limit of Detection (LLoD) of ctDNA KRAS G12\/13 assay is 0.002% mutant alleles in a background of wild-type DNA. Results Table 6 shows the results from this study.

Stage was not significant in this analysis. The hazard ratio (HR) of death for patients with \u22675.5 KRAS copies\/105 genome equivalents (GE or geq) is 2.4 times as high (95% CI: 2.0 to 4.9) as those with KRAS G12\/13 copies <5. 5\/105 GE. FIG. 11 shows estimated Kaplan-Meier survival plots for males, age <65, receiving gemcitabine, with baseline KRAS counts above and below 5.5 copies\/105 geq. Similar results were obtained for female and older patients. Combination of ctDNA KRAS G12\/14 and CA 19-9 Antigen Levels A combination of pre-treatment levels of ctDNA KRAS G12\/13 and CA 19-9 allows for a better fit of the model and a stronger association with OS. R2=23.9%, as compared 19.7% for the model with KRAS alone. Results are shown in Table 7. TABLE 7 KRAS copies\/105 geq CA 19-9 U\/mL N HR (95% CI) \u22665.5 <315 29 1.0 \u22675.5 \u2267315 30 1.6 (0.94 to 2.8) p = 0.08 >5.5 <315 29 2.5 (1.4 to 2.8) p = 0.002 >5.5 \u2267315 85 4.1 (2.5-6.8) p < 0.0001 The HR of death for patients with \u22675.5 KRAS copies\/105 GE and \u2267315 U\/mL CA 19-9 is 4.1 times as high as those with low KRAS and CA 19-9. FIG. 12 shows the estimated Kaplan-Meier survival plots for males, age <65, receiving gemcitabine, with baseline CA 19-9 counts above and below 315 and baseline KRAS counts of \u22665.5 cps\/105 geq and >5.5 cps\/105 geq. Similar results obtained for female and older patients. Monitoring ctDNA KRAS G12\/13 Mutations Longitudinally Post-Treatment is Associated with Outcomes in Patients with Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer Monitoring ctDNA KRAS levels on therapy may reflect tumor dynamics and better correlate with patient outcomes. In order to account for the effect of therapy, a time-dependent model was built that allows adjustment of estimated patient survival based on the combination of pre-treatment ctDNA KRAS levels and KRAS levels after 2 weeks on first line chemotherapy. Table 8 shows patient characteristics and baseline KRAS pre-treatment levels. TABLE 8 Patients with Decreases in ctDNA KRAS G12\/13 within First 2 Weeks of Chemotherapy Achieve Survival Benefit Baseline KRAS Week 2 KRAS Median 95% CI for Pre-treatment End of Cycle 1 Overall Median Overall (cps\/105 geq) (cps\/105 geq) N Survival Survival Gemcitabine >5.5 Examining 103 148 days 127-180 days baseline only >5.5 <100% decrease 78 134 days 104-159 days from baseline >5.5 100% decrease 20 224 days 189-325 days from baseline FOLFIRINOX >5.5 Examining 13 210 days 185-N.E.* days baseline only >5.5 <75% decrease from 6 194 days 94-N.E. days baseline >5.5 \u226775% decrease from 4 309 days 209-N.E. days baseline FIG. 13 provides plots of KRAS G12\/13 counts over time and hazard ratios relative to a patient with \u22665.5 cps\/105 geq KRAS G12\/13 at baseline (FIG. 13A) and a patient with >5.5 cps\/105 at baseline (FIG. 13B). Estimated and actual patient survival is shown. When taking into account ctDNA KRAS levels after 2 weeks on treatment, an estimated median survival more accurately reflects actual survival of individual patients (as compared to the median survival estimated based on pre-treatment ctDNA KRAS levels only). Conclusions In a study of 182 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, a statistically significant negative association was found between baseline ctDNA KRAS counts and OS (p<0.0001). A combination of ctDNA KRAS and CA 19-9 was a more powerful predictor of OS than either marker alone and allowed identification of a group of patients (17%) with significantly greater overall survival. Use of the time-dependent model for monitoring patients beyond baseline allows more accurate assessment of responsiveness to therapy and associated increase or decrease of predicted survival.

The same reference numerals refer to the same parts throughout the various Figures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, or uses. The terms such as inner, outer, middle, upper, lower, left, right, smaller, larger, longer, shorter, are used herein for reference purposes only and are not meant to be limiting. Referring to FIGS. 1-2, the disclosed invention may be an exoskeleton (100) system comprising at least one garment including a vest (110), pants (120), an upper arm sleeve (130), a lower arm sleeve (140), a thigh sleeve (150), and\/or a leg sleeve (160), wherein the garment may be a multilayer construct (e.g., as shown in FIG. 12) that comprises an inner layer (201) of nylon material and an outer layer (203) made of plush material, and an article (300) with attached hook and loop fasteners (301) to be mounted onto the garment by securing the hook and loop fasteners (301) onto any spots or locations of the outer layer (203). In one embodiment, the complete set of the exoskeleton (100) may be divided into eight different garments to cover different body segments of the wearer. In another embodiment, the complete set of the exoskeleton (100) may be only constituted of 2 different garment pieces, where all of the sleeves may be extended out from the vest and\/or pants, respectively. The garments disclosed in the present invention cover almost all of the major muscles parts of the body, namely, the back and rear torso, hip and groin, left and right thigh, left and right leg, left and right upper arm, as well as left and right lower arm. The materials for fabricating the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof are one of the key factors to deliver the advantages of the present invention. The inner layer (201) of the garments of the present invention may be directly in contact with the wearer's skin. Thus, it should be made of materials that are non-irritating and bio-compatible with human skin to reduce the likelihood of an allergic reaction in the wearer, while the material should also demonstrate good abrasion resistance, good durability, and high resilience, as well. In one embodiment, nylon, or a similar material, may be employed as the material to fabricate the inner layer (201). As the inner layer (201) of the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof is frequently stretched and subjected to friction with human skin, nylon material with the desired properties ensures durability of the disclosed invention for long term utilization. Further, the outer layer (203) of the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof may be derived from a plush material serving as a loop for anchorage of the articles with the hook and loop fasteners, more specifically the hook fasteners like VELCRO\u2122. However, the plush material described herein is not referred to as the loop fasteners of VELCRO\u2122, as VELCRO\u2122 is neither elastic nor stretchable, both of these properties being required in the present invention. With the plush fabric or material as the outer layer (203), the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof not only supports attachments of the articles but also renders the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof to feel smooth and silky. Moreover, the plush material used in the present invention may be non-irritating fabric to further avoid skin irritation. In accordance with one embodiment, a middle layer (202) made of neoprene or polyurethane may be disposed in between the outer layer (203) and the inner layer (201), e.g., as shown in FIG. 12. It should be appreciated that for the purposes of illustration, the right side of the multilayer construct has been \u201copened up\u201d to more clearly show the individual layers thereof. More preferably, the outer layer (203) and the inner layer (201) may be joined by the middle layer (202) to form a multilayer structure. The middle layer (202) may be made of a highly pliable, yet mechanically strong, material such as neoprene, polyurethane and\/or the like to give the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof the necessary structural integrity. Preferably, the three different layers are stitched together at the peripheral edges or laminated using adhesive, heat, pressure or any combination thereof. Without the middle layer (202), the wearer may find the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof, especially the sleeves, slides up or down or even folds due to the body's movement. The middle layer (202) may also guard the wearer from abrasive injuries and reinforces the body parts. Therapeutic compressive force may be evenly applied to the body parts via the middle layer (202) as well. Having the outer and inner layers covering the middle layer (202), neoprene induced skin irritation may be avoided. The nylon layer deposited in between the skin and the middle layer (202) makes the skin breathable. It is important to note that the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof can be worn in a complete set or a single piece depending upon the wearer's preference. For snug fitting, the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof may be slightly stretched or poised in a contracting state when the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof are worn. Thus, the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof may be compressive to the soft tissues on the body of the wearer upon wearing. As the term \u201ccompressive\u201d is used herein, it is meant to refer to the therapeutic compressive force being applied onto the body of the wearer while wearing the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof. It should also be appreciated that the compressive force will exert a pressure in the range of 4-40 mm Hg, depending on the body part and location, onto the body of the wearer while the subject is still wearing the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof. Referring to FIG. 3, different embodiments of the vest\/shirt design (110) are shown. FIG. 3a shows a sleeveless vest design, FIG. 3b shows a short sleeve shirt design, and FIG. 3c reveals a long sleeve shirt design that may eliminate the need of using an upper arm sleeve. Through the outer plush layer (203), articles can be removably attached anywhere on the front torso, back torso, side torso and the shoulder areas of the wearer onto the vest\/shirt of the exoskeleton. Preferably, the vest\/shirt may be made to be a seamless single piece for snug fitting. Embodiments can be adapted by the pants (120) as illustrated in FIGS. 4a and 4b. Shorts shown in FIG. 4a may cover the hip, groin and parts of the thigh of the wearer. The pants shown in FIG. 4b may extend down to the leg portion covering the whole thigh and leg area such that no thigh sleeve (150) and\/or leg sleeve (160) is needed. Further, as illustrated in FIG. 5, is one embodiment of the sleeve (180) where a similar design is generally applied for fabricating different sleeves of various bodies segments, namely, a thigh sleeve (150), a leg sleeve (160), an upper arm sleeve (130) and\/or a lower arm sleeve (140). These sleeves may be almost identical to one another besides being different in terms of dimension. Preferably, the sleeve (180) may be fabricated as a single seamless piece. For example, the sleeve (180) may be tubular and having two ends, namely, a first end (181) and a second end (182). The first end (181) may be tapered towards the second end (182) such that the second end (182) is smaller in diameter. For putting on the exoskeleton (100) and\/or garments thereof, the sleeve (180) may be orientated in such a way that the first end (181) is wrapped around a proximal end of the limb segment while the second end (182) is located at a distal end of the limb segment. The sleeve of a single limb segment may be produced in various sizes and lengths, e.g., as shown in FIG. 6, to be used by the wearer for different purposes. To suit the wearer's need, a strap may be fabricated adjacent the second end (182) and\/or first end (181) of the sleeve (180) to further tighten the sleeve and avoid slippage of the sleeve on the particular body part. More specifically, the sleeve may have at least one circumferential end to be adjustable in diameter by a strap attached thereon. The strap may run parallel or substantially parallel to a rim of the second end (182) and\/or first end (181) when it is pulled. Preferably, the strap may have a free end reaching out from a fixed end connecting the sleeve. A hook fastener or VELCRO\u2122 may be found at the back of the free end to be removably fixed onto the outer surface of the sleeve. Through wrapping and securing the free end around the sleeve, a loose space that occurred in between the skin and the first end or the second end can be tightened up. Other embodiments preferably have the fixed end slightly expanded to connect a larger surface area of the sleeve at length or in a direction perpendicular to the rim of the sleeve. Thus, pulling the strap in this embodiment actually tightens a larger area of the sleeve. In accordance with another embodiment, the sleeve (190) may be fabricated using the multilayer construct shown in FIG. 12 as a single piece (190) with one of its short edges equipped with hook fasteners (193) or VELCRO\u2122 at the inner layer (201). Preferably, the short edge may be divided into two different straps (195) (e.g., as illustrated in FIG. 7) such that each strap has a base connected to the sheet and a free end equipped with the hook fasteners (193) or VELCRO\u2122. The sheet wraps around the limb forming a sleeve of the exoskeleton and\/or garments thereof. Further, the wearer may pull the straps to tighten the sleeve and anchor the strap onto the outer plush surface. More preferably, the straps (195) may have an expanded base portion connecting the larger surface area of the sheet to effectively fasten the formed sleeve onto the limb upon pulling. According to another embodiment, the garments of the exoskeleton may be perforated. More specifically, a plurality of through holes may be punctured through the laminated layers. The presence of the through holes may promote air ventilation to the wrapped skin. Each of the through holes may be in the range of 1 to 4 mm in diameter and spaced apart in a predetermined distance in the range of 3 to 10 mm. The through holes may be fabricated smaller in size and stretched to the desired dimension upon wearing. One embodiment may have the whole exoskeleton perforated, yet there are embodiments wherein only a portion of the exoskeleton may be perforated to render the garment more aesthetically attractive. The perforations may make the multi-layer material breathable and comfortable so as to be used in warmer climates. However, in colder climates where heat retention is important, a non-perforated version may be applied where the multi-layered garments help to improve heat retention, allowing warming-up of the muscles and preserving the peripheral\/core body temperature of the wearer. As shown in FIG. 9, one embodiment of the article includes one or more exogenous weight loads. The exogenous weight load, in one embodiment, may be a solid bar produced by juxtaposing a plurality of substantially rectangular metal pieces and joining the juxtaposed metal pieces side by side via any known methods, e.g., through welding. Each of the metal pieces may weigh about 1 g to 10 g, depending on its material and fabricated dimensions. Consequently, each solid bar may weigh from 25 g to 200 g. Preferably, the solid bar may have a relatively slim cross-sectional profile so to be able to be attached closely to the wearer's body. The slim design may also reduce possible slippage of the exogenous weight caused by gravitational forces or by being accidentally scratched off by the wearer during vigorous body movement. More preferably, the solid bar may be bendable to allow it to twist or bend ergonomically without hindering body movement. For example, the joint sides of the metal pieces may be indented to render the solid bar bendable. The metal pieces may be comprised of lead, steel, iron or any other alloy materials. Coatings or covers may be applied to fully shield the weight load, followed by having the VELCRO\u2122 or hook fasteners fixed at the back or front of the coating. The coating or cover may be slightly elastic and may be made of any suitable thermosetting polymer, thermoplastic polymers, natural rubber or any combination thereof. Adhesives or any other known means can be used to fix the hook fastener or VELCRO\u2122 fastener onto the back and\/or front surfaces of the solid bar or coating. Nevertheless, the exogenous weight load may be embodied in the form of liquid-filled capsules, gel-filled capsules, solid granules such that the exogenous weight load of these forms are preferably coated or packed. Besides weight loads, the same anchorage mechanism may be applicable to other devices which the VELCRO\u2122 or hook fastener adheres onto the devices directly or a coating shields the device followed by having the VELCRO\u2122 attached on the coating. The devices may include, but are not limited to, stopwatches, timers, heart rate monitors, pedometers, motion sensors, force sensors, inertia sensors, acceleration sensors, GPS tracking devices, light reflector strips, hard or soft protective shells or liners, MP3 players or other audio listening devices, cameras or video cameras, phones, wallets and\/or the like. It should be noted that some of the devices such as a heart rate sensor may have to be in direct contact with the skin of the wearer. To accommodate such devices, the exoskeleton and\/or garments thereof may have a void area made at specific locations on the garments to permit the necessary contact or the device may be attached along the edge of the garment or even underneath. It is also plausible that the perforations may allow external devices to monitor physiological\/physical activity in partial contact with the skin through these perforations. In another embodiment, the external device may be two-pieced, with the anchor attached to the plush surface and a sensory device attached underneath the exoskeleton and\/or garments thereof in direct contact with the skin. This could then be linked either through telemetry to the device, sending feedback to it, or directly to the device through magnets and a direct connection link through the perforations or void areas. Nonetheless, the wearer may still position the devices at the preferred locations. In another embodiment, the article may be a pocket (300a) of any size as long it can be firmly and neatly attached onto the plush outer surface of the exoskeleton and\/or garments thereof. FIGS. 11a-11b show one embodiment of the pocket (300a). The pocket (300a) may be comprised of a hollow body (313) having a top opening, and a flap (312) extended out from one of the side surfaces of the hollow body (313) such that the flap (312) may be folded to cover the top opening. Devices to be held by the pocket (300a) may be inserted through the top opening, while the flap (312) may cover the top opening. One skilled in the art should appreciate the fact that the opening may not be necessary fabricated on top, but at one of the side surfaces with corresponding flaps. To secure the flap (312) when the pocket is in use, the flap may have a VELCRO\u2122 hook\/loop (311) at its inner surface to be attached on the VELCRO\u2122 loop\/hook (314) pre-disposed on the outer side surface opposite to the side surface where the flap reached out. Further, hook fasteners (315) may be located at one of the external side surfaces as shown in FIG. 11b to anchor the pocket (300a) onto the exoskeleton. Devices mentioned herein refer to exogenous weight loads, stopwatches, timers, heart rate monitors, pedometers, motion sensors, force sensors, inertia sensors, acceleration sensors, GPS tracking devices, light reflector strips, hard or soft protective shells or liners, MP3 players or other audio listening devices, cameras or video cameras, phones, wallets and\/or the like. These devices may be inserted into the pocket (300a) to be anchored onto the outer surface of the exoskeleton, thus eliminating the need, which can be occasionally impractical, to fix the hook fastener or VELCRO\u2122 onto the device, especially the surface of the devices is not favorable for attachment of the VELCRO\u2122. For example, a GPS tracking device may be put into the pocket and attached to a soccer player to allow analysis to be conducted on how the player positioned himself in a game. The exoskeleton of such an embodiment may be aesthetically enhanced too by having various stylish designed pockets. To tightly secure the exoskeleton and\/or garments onto the body, openings on the garments for the wearer to slide in may be preferably slightly narrower in diameter compared to the other parts of the garments to avoid slipping down or up of the worn garments. Preferably, the narrower openings may be achieved by pleating the edges of the opening to form a narrower opening thereto. Possibly, edges of the garments may be seamed to form ducts to provide a firmer grip onto the body to avoid garments slipping. Further embodiment may have an elastic band attached at the edges of the opening to attain the same effect as the pleats mentioned above. In yet another embodiment, the garment of the exoskeleton may be provided with a posture support (170), as shown in FIG. 13-16. The posture support (170) may include postural straps (172) capable of providing adjustable support to the wearer's trunk and abdomen. Particularly, the straps (172) may provide functional compression support to the core and lumbar region of the wearer. It should also be appreciated that the posture support (170) indicated herein may be capable of providing a functional increase in intra-abdominal pressure during exercise without the same level of restriction on movement and breathing, unlike conventional belts or restrictive back supports that are commercially available. This may be achieved through the novel anatomical shape of the posture supports (170) that follows the body's natural myofascial support system. Specifically, the tapered shape of the strap supports (172) may start at the upper-mid back thus drawing material tension from the thoracic-cervical spine right down to the lumbar-sacral region of the wearer. They (172) may wrap around the side of the torso across the oblique-transverse abdominal region, coming to a focal point over a partial area of the rectus abdominus at the front of the torso at or near the umbilical region. This unique shape and resulting compression that may be applied and adjusted on an individual basis by the wearer, provides the mechanical functional support needed to increase intra-abdominal pressure, while leaving key movement areas of the torso and abdominals uncovered and unrestricted. This allows the user more freedom of movement through the rotational torso region with less mechanical restriction on the main respiratory muscles of the abdominals. Correspondingly, the presence of such adjustable posture support (170) on the garment may be beneficial, especially to athletes or wearers with chronic low back pain or a recent back injury. The posture support (170), in one embodiment, may be an individual component removably attachable to the garment, particularly to the outer plush layer (203) of the garment, by means of a hook fastener (e.g., VELCRO\u2122). Alternatively, it (170) may be joined to the garment by stitching. In order to provide compression support to the wearer's body, the posture support (170), as depicted herein, may be fashioned from breathable elastic materials, including the multilayer construct as previously described, with or without modifications. In the case where the multilayer construct is used to fabricate the posture support (170), it should be appreciated that the hook fastener (e.g., VELCRO\u2122) may be attached on the outer surface of the nylon layer, instead of the outer plush layer. Accordingly, the hook fastener (e.g., VELCRO\u2122) on the nylon layer allows the posture support (170) to be attached to the garment. While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes can be made and equivalents can be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications can be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.","cpc_label":"A41D310016","ipc_label":"A41D3100","filing_date":"20160102","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20160428","examiner_id":"78443.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: The present invention relates to garments to be worn by a wearer that the garments serve as an exoskeleton., in the context of the novelty:  An exoskeleton (100) system comprises at least one garment selected from the group .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following description includes the best mode presently contemplated for practicing the described implementations. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but rather is made merely for the purpose of describing general principles of various implementations. The scope of invention should be ascertained with reference to issued claims. As an example, a system may include a display in a display housing that cooperates with a keyboard in a keyboard housing, which may, for example, allow for input of information via the display in addition to, or as an alternative to, input of information via the keyboard. In such an example, the keyboard housing and the display housing may connect via a hinge assembly (e.g., or hinge assemblies) that, for example, allows for pivoting of the housings, for example, to achieve a folded orientation of the keyboard housing and the display housing. As an example, where a display faces outwardly in a folded orientation, the display of the system may be used as a tablet (e.g., consider a scenario where the display is a touchscreen display). As an example, a system can include multiple housings where at least one of the housings is a display housing. As an example, a system can include two display housings coupled via one or more hinge assemblies where the display housings may be pivotable to a planar orientation and pivotable to a folded orientation, which may be one of a back-to-back, a front-to-back or a front-to-front orientation. As an example, a system can include a plurality of housings where one or more of the housings may be display housings and, for example, where one or more of the housings may be input component housings such as, for example, keyboard housings, touchscreen display housings, etc. In such an example, hinge assemblies can be included, which may optionally allow for decoupling and recoupling of one or more of the housings. FIG. 1 shows an example of a system 100 that includes a keyboard housing 120 and a display housing 140 that are pivotable with respect to each other via movement about one or more hinges 132-1 and 132-2 (e.g., hinge assemblies). FIG. 1 also shows an example of a system 180 that includes a first housing 182 and a second housing 184 that are pivotable with respect to each other via movement about one or more hinges 183 and an example of a system 190 that includes a first housing 192, a second housing 194 and a third housing 196 that may be pivotable with respect to each other via movement about hinges. As an example, the system 100, the system 180 and\/or the system 190 may include one or more processors 112, memory 114 (e.g., one or more memory devices), one or more network interfaces 116, and one or more power cells 118. Such components may be, for example, housed with the keyboard housing 120, the display housing 140, the keyboard housing 120 and the display housing 140, the housing 182, the housing 184, the housing 182 and the housing 184, one or more of the housings 192, 194 and 196, etc. As shown in the example of FIG. 1, the keyboard housing 120 includes a keyboard 124 with keys 125 and the display housing 140 includes a display 144. In such an example, the keyboard 124 is defined in a first Cartesian coordinate system as having a width along an x-axis (x1), a length along a y-axis (y1) and a height along a z-axis (z1) that extends in a direction outwardly away from touch surfaces of keys 125 of the keyboard 124 and the display 144 is defined in a second Cartesian coordinate system as having a width along an x-axis (x2), a length along a y-axis (y2) and a height along a z-axis (z2) that extends in a direction outwardly away from a viewing surface of the display 144. As shown in the example of FIG. 1, the one or more hinges 132-1 and 132-2 pivotably connect the keyboard housing 120 and the display housing 140 for orienting the display housing 140 with respect to the keyboard housing 120. For example, orientations may include orientations definable with respect to an axis (e.g., or axes) such as the axis and an angle \u03a6 about that axis. FIG. 1 shows some examples of orientations 101, 103, 105, 107 and 109. The orientation 101 may be a notebook orientation where the angle \u03a6 is about 90 degrees or more (e.g., or optionally somewhat less than about 90 degrees depending on position of a user, etc.). As shown, for the orientation 101, a user may use a finger or fingers of one or both hands to depress keys 125 of the keyboard 124 (e.g., touch typing), for example, while viewing information being rendered to the display 144 of the display housing 140 (e.g., using the one or more processors 112, the memory 114, etc. that may be included in the keyboard housing 120, the display housing 140 or both). As an example, the keyboard housing 120 may include a frontal surface 122 and may include a touch input surface 123 (e.g., of a touch input device such as a touchpad). As an example, the keyboard 124 may include one or more other input devices (e.g., a control stick, etc.). As to the orientation 103, it may correspond to a display orientation for viewing the display 144 where the keyboard 124 faces downward and the system 100 is supported by the keyboard housing 120 (e.g., by a rim about the keyboard 124, the frontal surface 122, etc.). As to the orientation 105, it may correspond to a \u201ctent\u201d orientation where the display 144 faces outwardly for viewing on one side of the tent and the keyboard 124 of the keyboard housing 120 faces outwardly on the other side of the tent. The orientation 107 may be a tablet orientation where the angle \u03a6 is about 360 degrees such that a normal outward vector N1 of the keyboard 124 of the keyboard housing 120 and a normal outward vector N2 of the display 144 of the display housing 140 are oriented in oppositely pointing directions, pointing away from each other; whereas, in contrast, for a closed orientation of the system 100 (e.g., where the angle \u03a6 is about 0 degrees), the vectors N1 and N2 would be pointing toward each other. The orientation 109 may be a planar orientation where the angle \u03a6 is about 180 degrees such that a normal outward vector N1 of the keyboard 124 of the keyboard housing 120 and a normal outward vector N2 of the display 144 of the display housing 140 are oriented in approximately the same pointing directions. As shown in FIG. 1, the system 180 can include a folded orientation 187 and a planar orientation 189. As an example, one or both of the housings 182 and 184 may include a display. As shown in FIG. 1, the system 190 can include various orientations, including, for example, a planar orientation of the three housings, a partially folded orientation and a folded orientation. As an example, a three housing system may be configurable in more than one folded orientation with respect to a \u201cmiddle\u201d housing. For example, the housings 192 and 196 may be folded with respect to the housing 194 with the housing 192 on the top side or bottom side or with the housing 196 on the top side or bottom side. FIG. 2 shows an example of a system 200 and an example of a method 250. As shown, the system 200 includes two housings 220 and 240 operatively coupled via a hinge assembly 230. As shown in the example of FIG. 2, a latch portion of the hinge assembly 230 may be substantially centered along an axial lengthwise dimension such that it can function in a plurality of orientations of a housing or housings. In the example of FIG. 2, the housing 220 includes a keyboard 224 that defines a keyboard side of the housing 220 and the housing 240 includes a display 244 that defines a display side of the housing 240. The hinge assembly 230 allows for decoupling of the housing 240 (e.g., from a first orientation) and recoupling of the housing 240 such that a back side 246 can face the keyboard side of the housing 220 (e.g., to a second orientation). In such an example, the housing 240 may be rotated in a clamshell manner such that the back side 246 covers the keyboard 224. In such an example, a back side of the housing 220, which may not include a keyboard 224 (e.g., may be a relatively smooth, substantially planar surface, etc.), may form a back side of a tablet orientation of the system 200 where the display 244 may be an outwardly visible display of the tablet orientation. As an example, the display 224 may be a touchscreen display and\/or a stylus sensitive display. In the example orientations of FIG. 2 (e.g., top orientation and bottom orientation), the housings 220 and 240 can substantially align at their side edges. As mentioned, a latch portion of the hinge assembly 230 can be substantially centered along an axial lengthwise dimension, which may correspond to an edge dimension of the housing 220 and an edge dimension of the housing 240. For example, the housing 240 can include a single receptacle that can receive the latch portion of the hinge assembly 230 in multiple orientations of the housing 240 with respect to the housing 220. As an example, the housing 220 can include a single receptacle that can receive another latch portion of the hinge assembly 230. As an example, the hinge assembly 230 may be oriented in various orientations and receive via one latch portion one housing and receive via another latch portion, another housing. As an example, a hinge assembly may include multiple latch portions. For example, consider a two axle hinge assembly with two latch portions or a three axle hinge assembly with three latch portions where, for example, in the two foregoing examples, at least one housing may be operatively coupled to a latch portion. As an example, a housing may include a receptacle along one edge and an receptacle along another edge. In such an example, the housing may be oriented such that either receptacle can receive a latch portion of a hinge assembly. As to the method 250, it includes an operation block 252 for operating a coupled system in a first orientation, a decouple block 254 for decoupling a housing of the system from another housing of the system and an operation block 256 for operating the system in a second orientation that differs from the first orientation. For example, the method 250 may be performed with respect to the system 200 where the system 200 can be operated in two different orientations, which may be a notebook orientation and a tablet orientation. FIG. 3 shows the system 200 with an enlarged view of an example of the hinge assembly 230. As an example, the system 200 may be an apparatus that includes a processor; memory accessible by the processor; the housing 240 as a first housing that includes a front side and a back side; the housing 220 as a second housing that includes a front side and a back side; and the hinge assembly 230 operatively coupled to the second housing 220 where the hinge assembly 230 includes a set of axles 232, a set of gears 234 and a latch 236 pivotable via meshed rotation of the gears 234 about an axis defined by one of the axles 232 where, in a latched state, the latch operatively couples the first housing 240 to the hinge assembly 230. As an example, the hinge assembly 230 can include one or more components 270, which may be covered at least in part by a cover 280. As an example, the cover 280 may be at least in part translatable to cover the one or more components 270. In the example of FIG. 3, the one or more components 270 are illustrated as being two components with substantially cylindrical shapes. As an example, a component or components may be of or include a different type of shape. As an example, a component may be characterized by a length and a width where the length may be greater than the width such that the component has an aspect ratio where its length is at least several times greater than its width. As an example, a component may be a battery cell (e.g., a lithium ion cell, etc.), a stylus, a heat pipe, an antenna, a cooling vent, etc. As an example, a system may allow for interchangeable components. For example, a system may include two slots where the two slots can receive a same type of component or can receive different types of components. As an example, a system can include two slots where one or both slots can receive a battery, where one or both slots can receive a stylus, where one or both slots can receive a heat pipe, where one or both slots can receive an antenna, where one or both slots can receive a cooling vent, etc. As an example, the cover 280 may cover at least a set of gears. For example, a hinge assembly can include two sets of gears where one set of gears may be covered by one cover and where the other set of gears may be covered by another cover. In such an example, one or both of the covers may be removable. As an example, a system may include one or more slots that extend axially away from one set of gears (e.g., in a first direction) and may include one or more slots that extend axially away from another set of gears (e.g., in a second, opposing direction). As an example, such slots may be empty or occupied by one or more components. As an example, fewer than all slots may be occupied by a component or components. As an example, a component may be an accessory. As an example, a component may be electrically coupled to circuitry in a housing or housings. As an example, an accessory may be passive. For example, consider a cooling vent that is shaped to direct flow of air into and\/or out of one or more housings (e.g., as may be driven by a fan or fans, etc.). FIG. 4 shows an example of a portion of the system 200 in a configuration 401 where the housing 220 is replaced with a different housing 420, which may be a stand, which may optionally include circuitry and\/or one or more other components (e.g., passive and\/or active). In such an example, the housing 220 may be decoupled from the hinge assembly 230 and the housing 420 coupled to the hinge assembly 230. As an example, the housing 420 may house one or more electronic components such as, for example, a battery or batteries. As an example, the housing 420 may be shaped to function as a hand grip, which may be suitable for gripping via a user's left hand and\/or a user's right hand. As an example, the housing 420 may be a stand that is shaped to rest and\/or couple to a dashboard, a table, etc. As an example, the housing 420 may be a dock and may include one or more ports (e.g., power, USB, video and\/or audio, network, etc.). FIG. 4 also shows an example of a configuration 402 where two housings 240-1 and 240-2 are operatively coupled via a hinge assembly 230-1 and where the housing 240-2 is operatively coupled via a hinge assembly 230-2 to the housing 220. In such an example, the housings 240-1 and 240-2 may be oriented such that two people can view displays (see, e.g., tented orientation in the lower left view of FIG. 4). As an example, another housing such as the housing 220 may be operatively coupled to the housing 240-1 such that two people can interact with a system that includes, for example, four housing operatively coupled via three hinge assemblies. FIG. 5 shows an example of a hinge assembly 500 that includes axles 520-1 and 520-2, gears 540-1, 540-2, 540-3 and 540-4, a mechanism 550, and latches 560-1 and 560-2. As shown in the example of FIG. 5, the latch 560-1 includes a release button 561-1 and the latch 560-2 includes a release button 561-2. The release buttons 561-1 and 561-2 may be actuatable to release a housing from a respective one of the latches 560-1 and 560-2. As an example, each of the axles 520-1 and 520-2 can define a respective axis about while a housing coupled to a respective, corresponding one of the latches 560-1 and 560-2 may pivot. As an example, the release buttons 561-1 and 561-2 can be accessible to a user when a housing is operatively coupled to a respective, corresponding one of the latches 560-1 and 560-2. As an example, the release buttons 561-1 and 561-2 may be oriented such that they can face each other in a first orientation and face away from each other in a second orientation. As an example, a hinge assembly can include release buttons on more than one side. For example, consider a hinge assembly with two release buttons such as the release button 561-1 and another release button being positioned on an opposing side of the latch 560-1. FIG. 6 shows a side view of the hinge assembly 500 and components 570-1 and 570-2, which may be covered by a hinge assembly housing or cover 580. FIG. 6 also shows examples of features that may be included in a hinge assembly, associated components, a housing, etc. As an example, circuitry may be included to operatively couple one or more components associated with a hinge assembly to one or more components of a housing or housings. For example, wires or other types of conductors may run along or through the axle 520-1 and extend to a portion of the latch 560-1 with one or more contacts 563-1 and a housing 620 (e.g., with a keyboard, etc.) or a housing 640 (e.g., with a display, etc.) can include an edge 622 with a receptacle 660 where one or more contacts 663 may mate with the one or more contacts 563-1. As an example, the contacts 663 may be located symmetrically and\/or asymmetrically with respect to a housing. For example, as the housing may be oriented to two or more orientations, pairs of asymmetric contacts may be included and\/or symmetric contacts may be included where symmetric contacts can make connections in a plurality of orientations of a housing. As an example, one or more edges of a housing may include a receptacle that can receive a latch of a hinge assembly (see, e.g., the configuration 402 of FIG. 4). FIG. 6 also shows example features such as connectors 573-1, 575-1, 673-1 and 675-1. Such connectors may be for electrical connections and\/or air flow connections. As an example, a component such as the component 570-1 may include an air mover such as a fan where power for the fan (e.g., and optionally control commands, etc.) may be available by coupling of the connectors 573-1 and 673-1 and air may be moved in one or more directions via operation of the fan via coupling of the connectors 575-1 and 675-1. In such an example, the component 570-1 may be a cooling accessory that includes one or more air movers and that can direct air into and\/or air out of a housing or housings. FIG. 7 shows a perspective view of a hinge assembly 700 that includes axles 720-1 and 720-2, gears 740-1, 740-2 and 740-3, latches 760-1 and 760-2 and a cover 780. As shown in the example of FIG. 7, the latch 760-1 includes a release button 761-1 and the latch 760-2 includes a release button 761-2. The release buttons 761-1 and 761-2 may be actuatable to release a housing from a respective one of the latches 760-1 and 760-2. In the example of FIG. 7, the gears 740-1 and 740-2 are shown as having axes that are substantially parallel and the gear 740-3 has an axis that is oriented orthogonally to the axes of the gears 740-1 and 740-2. In the assembly 700, the gear 740-3 may be a space gear that acts to couple the gears 740-1 and 740-2, for example, to accommodate a difference in space between the axles 720-1 and 720-2 (e.g., for two housings operatively coupled to the latches 760-1 and 760-2). As an example, an assembly can include an intermediate gear or intermediate gears. For example, the gear 740-3 may be considered to be an intermediate gear. As an example, a hinge assembly may include one or more intermediate gears that may be sized with respect to a pair of gears, for example, to minimize size of the hinge assembly, for example, by offsetting of one or more intermediate gear(s) from a centered position, it is possible to achieve a result that shortens a distance between centers of the two main gears. In such an example, an intermediate gear or intermediate gears allows for assemblies of different thicknesses of housings to possibly implement a standard pair of main gears (e.g., where adjustments occur via sizing, positioning, etc. of one or more intermediate gears). As an example, a three gear set may include an intermediate gear offset from centers of the other two gears. FIG. 8 shows an example of a latch 800 that includes a hinge base 802 for operatively coupling the latch 800 to an axle (e.g., coupled to one or more gears, etc.) and an extension 820 that extends outwardly from the hinge base 802. In the example of FIG. 8, the hinge base 802 includes a first slot 804 as an opening on one side and a second slot 806 as a recess on an opposing side. As shown, a slider 810 includes a raised portion 815 that is received by the first slot 804 while the slider 810 is at least partially received by the second slot 806. As shown, a cap 830 operatively couples to the extension 820 whereby posts 823 of the extension 820 can be received by openings 833 of the cap 830. Further shown in the example of FIG. 8 is an axle 821 that is received by an opening 831 of the cap 830. The axle 821 is part of a mechanism housed by the extension 820 and the cap 830 that is operatively coupled to the slider 810 such that translation of the slider 810 in the slots 804 and 806 causes rotation of a rotational component that is operatively coupled to prongs 850-1 and 850-2 that provide for latching and unlatching a housing or other component. FIG. 9 shows views of the latch 800 including an underside view of the cap 830, an underside view of the cap 830 with the slider 810, a rotational component 855, springs 845-1 and 845-2 that are received at least in part via recesses 835-1 and 835-2 of the cap 830 and the prongs 850-1 and 850-2 where the springs 845-1 and 845-2 bias the prongs 850-1 and 850-2 outwardly in a configuration that corresponds to a latched state. Arrows indicate that translation of the slider 810 to the right causes the rotational component 855 to rotate clockwise, which, in turn, causes the prongs 850-1 and 850-2 to retract inwardly. In such a manner, a housing or other component may be released from the latch 800. As an example, a housing can include a slot that receives the latch 800 and include recesses that receive the prongs 850-1 and 850-2 such that the latch 800 is operatively coupled to the housing. To release the latch for decoupling of the housing from the latch 800, a user may apply force to the raised portion 815 of the slider 810 to translate the slider 810 where the applied force is sufficient to overcome friction and force of the springs 845-1 and 845-2 such that the prongs 850-1 and 850-2 are drawn inwardly, each a respective distance, to release the latch 800 from a housing. FIG. 9 shows the extension 820 as including the posts 823 and the slider 810 as including a peg 817 that is received by a fork 857 of the rotational component 855. As the peg 817 is translated in the recess 806, the fork 817 moves in a manner that rotates the rotational component 855 about the axle 821. As shown, the prongs 850-1 and 850-2 are coupled to axles 859-1 and 859-2 of the rotational component 855, for example, the prongs 850-1 and 850-2 can include apertures 851-1 and 851-2 that receive the axles 859-1 and 859-2, respectively. FIG. 10 shows an example of a system 1000 that includes a first housing 1040 and a second housing 1020 operatively coupled via a hinge assembly 1030 where the system 1000 can include one or more components 1080-1 and 1080-2. As an example, the one or more components 1080-1 and 1080-2 can optionally be removable, insertable, replaceable, etc. during operation of circuitry of the system 1000. As an example, the housing 1020 and\/or the housing 1040 can include an interface or interfaces that can operatively couple to a component, which may include circuitry. For example, an interface may be a contact interface where electrical contact or contacts are made. As shown in FIG. 10, the components can include one or more of a battery 1081, a stylus 1082, a heat pipe 1083, a cooling vent 1084, memory 1085, a processor 1086, an antenna 1087 and one or more other components. FIG. 11 shows the system 1000 as including a keyboard 1024 and a display 1044 where a graphical user interface 1110 may be rendered to the display 1044, for example, to display information associated with one or more components, which may be hinge assembly slot components. For example, consider an arrangement of components that include a first stylus, a second stylus, memory and a graphics processing unit (GPU). In such an example, the slots may include components for a graphics application that may execute using one or more processors. As an example, the GPU may include a plurality of cores where the memory may be accessible by one or more of the plurality of cores. As an example, the GPU may include circuitry for parallel processing of information and, for example, for rendering graphics to the display 1044. As an example, where a hinge assembly is operatively coupled to a plurality of display housings, such an approach may provide for rendering graphics to a plurality of displays. FIG. 12 shows an example of an assembly 1200 that includes housing connectors 1202 and 1204 (e.g., latches) that are operatively coupled to axles 1225 and 1245 of a first gear 1220 and a second gear 1240 where the gears 1220 and 1240 are lobed gears. In such an example, a housing may include one or more latching features that can cooperate with features of one or both of the housing connectors 1202 and 1204. For example, a housing may include a receptacle with one or more prongs, etc. that may couple via openings and\/or other features of the housing connectors 1202 and 1204. As shown in the example of FIG. 12, the assembly can include a coupler 1270 that can include a pair of components 1272 and 1274 that are spaced by a spacer 1275 where the components 1272 and 1274 can receive the axles 1225 and 1245. Between the components 1272 and 1274, the axles 1225 and 1245 may be fit with one or more springs 1282 and 1284. For example, spring washers such as Belleville washers may be fit between the components 1272 and 1274 (e.g., coned-disc springs, conical spring washers, disc springs, cupped spring washer, etc.). A washer may include a frusto-conical shape that imparts a spring characteristic. As an example, coupler 1270 can include one or more compression mechanisms that can apply force, for example, to one or more springs (e.g., to the spring 1282 and 1284). For example, consider the bolt or screw 1276 and the nuts 1277 and 1278. As an example, the springs 1282 and 1284 may bias respective cam components 1283 and 1285 that may interact with features of the component 1272 or one or more of the gears 1220 and 1240. FIG. 13 shows a portion of the assembly 1200 without the housing connectors 1202 and 1204. As shown, the gears 1220 and 1240 may include recesses that can receive components 1222 and 1242, respectively. As shown in the example of FIG. 13, a gear may be defined by a dimension such as, for example, \u0394y (e.g., a gear length). As shown in the example of FIG. 13, a gear may be defined by dimensions such as a peak radius rp and a valley radius rv. In such an example, these radii may be lobe dimensions and define an angle therebetween (e.g., for a half a lobe). As an example, a hinge assembly can include one or more sets of gears such as, for example, the gears 1220 and 1240. FIG. 14 shows the gears 1220 and 1240 in a perspective view, a hollow cutaway view and in a cross-sectional view along with components 1243 and 1244 received by recesses of the gears 1220 and 1240, respectively. As shown in FIG. 15, each of the gears 1220 and 1240 include three helical lobes. The gears 1220 and 1240 may mesh akin to helical lobed rotor, for example, of a fluid pump. FIG. 15 shows the assembly 1200 and the cam components 1283 and 1285 as including features that cooperate with features of the component 1274 (see, e.g., dashed line). For example, the features may provide for locking at one or more angles of rotation of a first housing with respect to a second housing. As an example, one component may include a ridge and another component may include a valley that can receive the ridge upon rotation of one of the components with respect to the other one of the components. As an example, a component may include one or more ridges and\/or one or more valleys. In the example assembly 1200, the gears 1220 and 1240 include helical lobes that are different handed. In such an example, the gears 1220 and 1240 rotate in different directions. For example, where the gear 1220 rotates in a clockwise direction, the gear 1240 rotates in a counter-clockwise direction and vice versa. Thus, given a clamshell arrangement of two housing coupled via the assembly 1200, the gears 1220 and 1240 may rotate to orient the housings in a front side to front side orientation and in a back side to back side orientation. As an example, the assembly 1200 may be included as part of a hinge assembly of a system. As an example, a gear may include an involute profile or a non-involute profile. An involute profile can include teeth that are involutes, for example, of a circle or an ellipse. The involute of a circle may be defined by a spiraling curve traced by the end of an imaginary taut string unwinding itself from that stationary circle called the base circle. As an example, a hinge assembly can include two elliptical gears, one that may be operatively coupled to a first housing (e.g., a base) and one that may be operatively coupled to a second housing (e.g., top). In such an example, the major axis of the ellipse can be equal in length to the thickness of the first housing while the minor axis of the ellipse can be equal to the second housing thickness, for example, where the first housing may be thicker than the second housing. In such an assembly, a link can connect the gears (e.g., via axles, etc.) where the gears maintain a constant distance (e.g., equal to the sum of the lengths of the major semi-axis and minor semi-axis). In such an example, the hinge assembly can help to ensure smooth rolling and engagement without separation. As an example, gears may be of an elliptical or other shape (e.g., with two dimensions that correspond to two housing thicknesses) and assembled orthogonal to each other (e.g., as defined by the two dimensions). In such an example, coordinated motion may be achieved as one housing is rotated relative to another housing. Such motion may be synchronous motion. As an example, motion may be about 360 degrees, for example, for a back side to back side orientation and a front side to front side orientation of two housings. FIG. 16 shows thicknesses \u0394z1 and \u0394z2 as well as dimensions \u0394z and \u0394y, which may be gear region dimensions. FIG. 16 shows a first gear 1620, which may be operatively coupled to a first housing, and a second gear 1640, which may be operatively coupled to a second housing. In such an example, the first and second gears 1620 and 1640 mesh, for example, to orient the first and second housings, for example, in a front side to front side orientation and in a back side to back side orientation. As an example, the gears 1620 and 1640 may be configured to be detached and reattached to one or more housings. As an example, latches may be included in a hinge assembly with gears such as the gears 1620 and 1640. As an example, the gears 1620 and 1640 can rotate about respective axles 1625 and 1645 that may be coupled via a coupler (e.g., as part of a hinge assembly, etc.). The gears 1620 and 1640 may be elliptical or circular and include teeth. In the example of FIG. 16, sets of plates 1652 and 1654 are disposed adjacent to the gear 1620 and sets of plates 1656 and 1658 are disposed adjacent to the gear 1640. Such plates may mesh, for example, with interference fits therebetween to add friction or with clearances therebetween. Such plates may act as guards that hinder objects from getting caught in the gears 1620 and 1640 as they mesh (e.g., during rotation of at least one of the gears). As an example, an assembly can include spur gears with spacer and\/or side plates. Such an approach may act to reduce risk of finger pinch as the plates, which may be on either side of a spur gear can help prevent a finger from entering a gear contact region. In such an example, an outer perimeter of a plate may match that of a gear teeth outer perimeter, for example, so sliding an assembly, on a delicate desk surface, may be smooth rather than risking a spur gear gouging\/marring the surface (e.g., in absence of the plates). FIG. 16 shows a view of the gears 1620 and 1640, the axles 1625 and 1645 and the sets of plates 1652, 1654, 1656 and 1658. As shown, the sets of plates 1652, 1654, 1656 and 1658 may include extensions or tongue portions and head portions. For example, an extension may be received by a housing to support the head portion of a set of plates. As an example, each of the gears 1620 and 1640 can include a gear head portion and an extension or a tongue where such an extension may be received by a housing to support the gear head portion. Various examples of dimensions are shown in FIG. 16, including an axis to tongue end dimension \u0394x, thickness dimensions \u0394z1 and \u0394z2 and dimensions \u0394ya, \u0394yb and \u0394yc, which correspond to dimensions of the set of plates 1652, the gear 1620 and the set of plates 1654; noting that dimensions may be specified that correspond to the set of plates 1656, the gear 1640 and the set of plates 1658. As shown in FIG. 16, shapes may be elliptical and defined by a major axis (a) and a minor axis (b), which intersect at a center. As mentioned, a gear may rotate about an axle where the axle may be at the center of the gear. As an example, one gear may rotate with respect to another gear or gears may rotate in unison (e.g., synchronously). As illustrated in FIG. 16, the gear 1620 may be aligned along a major axis and the gear 1640 may be aligned along a minor axis. FIG. 17 shows an example of an assembly 1700 that includes a first housing 1702 that includes a front side and a back side and a thickness therebetween, a second housing 1704 that includes a front side and a back side and a thickness, a first set of gears 1730-1 and a second set of gears 1730-2. In the example of FIG. 17, thickness dimensions \u0394z1 and \u0394z2 are shown for the housings 1702 and 1704, respectively. As an example, the sets of gears 1730-1 and 1730-2 may be included in a hinge assembly or hinge assemblies, which may include one or more latches where, for example, a housing may be decoupled, reoriented and recoupled. As shown in FIG. 17, a first gear 1720 is operatively coupled to the first housing 1702 and a second gear 1740 is operatively coupled to the second housing 1704. In such an example, the first and second gears 1720 and 1740 mesh to orient the first and second housings 1702 and 1704, for example, in a front side-to-front side orientation and in a back side-to-back side orientation. In the assembly 1700, the gears 1720 and 1740 rotate about respective axles 1725 and 1745 that are coupled via a coupler 1770 (e.g., as part of a hinge assembly, etc.). For example, the coupler 1770 may be disposed at an end of the gears 1720 and 1740 and receive the axles 1725 and 1745 such that the axles 1725 and 1745 remain a certain distance apart and such that the housings 1702 and 1704 remain coupled during rotation. As an example, a coupler may be proximate to a region through which one or more cables may pass, for example, from one housing to another housing. As an example, an assembly may include more than one coupler. For example, the assembly 1700 may include the coupler 1770 on one side of the gears 1720 and 1740 and another coupler on another side of the gears 1720 and 1740. As an example, a coupler may be positioned between gears, for example, as a spacer between portions of a gear of a first housing and between portions of a gear of a second housing. As an example, the gears 1720 and 1740 may be elliptical, circular or of another shape and include teeth. For example, as shown in FIG. 17, the \u201cteeth\u201d are shaped as helical ridges where adjacent helical ridges are separated by a helical groove (e.g., define a helical groove). In the example of FIG. 17, the gears 1720 and 1740 may be referred to as worm gears. As shown in an enlarged view, a gear may be defined with respect to a reference frame. For example, using the visible end of the housings 1702 and 1704 as a reference, the gear 1720 includes two portions, one including a counter-clockwise helix (CCW) and the other including a clockwise helix (CW) while the gear 1740 includes two portions, one including a clockwise helix (CW) and the other including a counter-clockwise helix (CCW). Thus, as illustrated in the example of FIG. 17, a CCW portion of the gear 1720 meshes with a CW portion of the gear 1740 and a CW portion of the gear 1720 meshes with a CCW portion of the gear 1740. As an example, a gear or gears may include multiple portions with helix orientations that may differ (e.g., or be the same). As shown, a corresponding gear or gears may include multiple portions with helix orientations that can mesh with such a gear or gears. As an example, gears may include portions that act to \u201cbalance\u201d various forces (e.g., torque, etc.). In such an example, smoother movement may be achieved for movement of a housing with respect to another housing or simultaneous movement of two housings. As an example, a gear with a clockwise portion and a counter-clockwise portion that meshes with another gear with a clockwise portion and a counter-clockwise portion may act to provide for a no-slip condition. As an example, a hinge assembly can include worm gears. As an example, a worm gear may be perceived, aesthetically, as being different than a spur gear. For example, helical teeth of a worm gear may be perceived as being smoother than the teeth of a spur gear. As an example, a worm gear may be fashion in a more \u201cstreamlined\u201d manner. As an example, a worm gear may, when compared to a spur gear, have a less of an industrial look to a user. FIG. 18 shows the gears 1720 and 1740 and the axles 1725 and 1745. As illustrated in FIG. 18, the gears 1720 and 1740 can be helical elliptical gears. In such an example, helical grooves defined by helical teeth. Various examples of dimensions are shown in FIG. 18, including an axis to tongue end dimension \u0394x; thickness dimensions \u0394z1 and \u0394z2; dimensions \u0394ya, \u0394yb and \u0394yc, which correspond to dimensions of a gear or gear portion, a spacer and another gear or gear portion; and dimensions \u0394yg and \u0394yt, which correspond to a groove dimension and a tooth or ridge dimension. As an example, teeth on a helical gear can be cut at an angle to a gear face. As an example, a helix may include multiple turns (e.g., consider two turns, three turns, etc.). As an example, a gear may be defined at least in part by a pitch (e.g., a pitch of a helix being a dimension of a helix turn as measured in a direction parallel to an axis of the helix). As an example, a gear may be described as being right-handed or left-handed or, for example, clockwise or counter-clockwise. For example, with an observer's line of sight along a helix axis, if a clockwise screwing motion moves the helix away from the observer, then it may be defined as a right-handed helix; if towards the observer, then it may be defined as left-handed helix; or, for example, a stationary helix may be viewed as spiraling away from an observer in a clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) manner. The extent of engagement may make helical gears operate more smoothly (e.g., and quietly) than spur gears. As shown in FIG. 18, the teeth (e.g., ridges) span an arc angle about a substantially elliptical head portion from which a tongue portion extends. For example, the gear 1720 includes a counter-clockwise portion with approximately four teeth segments (e.g., making about three turns) that define grooves therebetween (e.g., between adjacent segments) and the gear 1720 includes a clockwise portion with approximately four teeth segments (e.g., making about three turns) that define grooves therebetween (e.g., between adjacent segments). The gear 1740 includes a clockwise portion with approximately four teeth segments (e.g., making about three turns) that define grooves therebetween (e.g., between adjacent segments) and the gear 1740 includes a counter-clockwise portion with approximately four teeth segments (e.g., making about three turns) that define grooves therebetween (e.g., between adjacent segments). As illustrated, a segment may differ from another segment. For example, an end segment may include an arc angle less than an intermediate segment. In the example of FIG. 18, the helixes of the gear 1720 terminate at or near the tongue portion, which is aligned with the major axis of the substantially elliptically shaped head portion while the helixes of the gear 1740 terminate at or near the tongue portion, which is aligned with the minor axis of the substantially elliptically shaped head portion. As an example, with respect to the head portions, in the views of FIG. 18, the gear 1720 may be considered an upward facing while the gear 1740 may be considered forward facing. As an example, where the gear 1740 is stationary, the gear 1720 may rotate about the gear 1740, for example, to achieve an arrangement where the gear 1720 is below the gear 1740 (see, e.g., uppermost view where the gear 1720 is above the gear 1740). In such an example, a \u201cmidway\u201d point may be achieved where the tongue portions of the gears 1720 and 1740 extend away from each other, which may be referred to as a planar orientation of the gears 1720 and 1740. As an example, an assembly may include a portion of the gear 1720 and a portion of the gear 1740. For example, consider a clockwise portion of the gear 1720 and a counter-clockwise portion of the gear 1740 or vice versa. As an example, a gap may exist between portions of a gear. As an example, a gear may include multiple clockwise portions and\/or multiple counter-clockwise portions. For example, consider a gear such as the gear 1720 with multiple clockwise portions or with multiple counter-clockwise portions or, for example, the gear 1740 with multiple clockwise portions or with multiple counter-clockwise portions. As to a gap, the example of FIG. 18 shows a gap that is less than an axial length (e.g., along an axle axis) of a portion of a gear (e.g., a clockwise portion or a counter-clockwise portion). As an example, a gap may be of another dimension, which may be defined, for example, with respect to an axial length (e.g., along an axle axis) of a portion of a gear. For example, a gap may be greater than a length of a gear or a portion of a gear. As mentioned, portions of a gear can include a clockwise portion and a counter-clockwise portion, a clockwise portion and a clockwise portion and\/or a counter-clockwise portion and a counter-clockwise portion. As an example, each portion may be of approximately the same axial length (e.g., along an axle axis). As an example, axial lengths of portions may differ. As an example, number of teeth or segments may differ. As an example, number of grooves may differ. As an example, an assembly may include more than one type of gear. As an example, an assembly can include spacers and worm, face gear \u201cparadoxical\u201d gears with elliptical shapes. In such an example, the assembly may include a first housing and a second housing with different thicknesses. In such an example, worm gears may mesh (e.g., optionally via synchronized motion). As an example, worm gears may include relatively smooth profiles, which may, for example, reduce risk of finger pinch, marring\/gouging a surface (e.g., a desk surface), catching clothing (e.g., grabbing a stocking from device placed on a leg or legs), etc. As an example, a left hand elliptic worm with an adjacent right hand elliptical worm in combination (e.g., optionally with a spacer between) may allow for synchronous opening\/closing and enforcement of a no-slip condition. As an example, multiple gearing pairs may act to balance (e.g., share) torque load during movement of one housing with respect to another or movement of housings (e.g., synchronously). As an example, a hinge assembly may include gears whereby the gears provide for synchronous movement of latches (e.g., latch portions). In such an example, where housings are operatively coupled to the latches, the housings may be moved synchronously. As an example, an apparatus can include a processor; memory accessible by the processor; a first housing that includes a front side and a back side; a second housing that includes a front side and a back side; and a hinge assembly operatively coupled to the second housing where the hinge assembly includes a set of axles, a set of gears and a latch pivotable via meshed rotation of the gears about an axis defined by one of the axles where, in a latched state, the latch operatively couples the first housing to the hinge assembly. In such an example, the apparatus can include a hinge assembly housing that covers at least a portion of the set of gears. As an example, such an apparatus can include a battery where, for example, the hinge assembly housing covers at least a portion of the battery where the battery can be shaped such that it includes a longitudinal axis that is substantially parallel to the axis defined by one of the axles. As an example, a hinge assembly may define an intermediate space between two housings. For example, consider an edge of a first housing that includes a receptacle for receipt of a first latch of a hinge assembly and an edge of a second housing that includes a receptacle for receipt of a second latch of the hinge assembly. In such an example, the edges may be spaced apart by a distance determined at least in part by two axles of the hinge assembly. As an example, an intermediate space or intermediate spaces may provide for inclusion of one or more components. As an example, a component may be a passive component and\/or an active component. For example, a passive component may direct flow of air to and\/or from an air mover such as a fan; or, for example, a passive component may be a heat sink, optionally with fins or other structural features that can help to dissipate heat energy generated by circuitry operating in a first and\/or a second housing that can pivot about a hinge assembly. As an example, an active component may include circuitry that can be operatively coupled to circuitry in a first and\/or a second housing that can pivot about a hinge assembly. As an example, an active component may be a battery, memory, a processor, a speaker, a port, an antenna, etc. In such an example, a first and\/or a second housing can include one or more interfaces. As an example, a housing can include symmetric interfaces that allow for mounting the housing to a latch of a hinge assembly in one of two orientations. As an example, a battery can be a component that includes a longitudinal axis that is substantially parallel to an axis defined by one of a plurality of axles of a hinge assembly. In such an example, the battery can include a length along the longitudinal axis that is greater than a cross-sectional dimension of the battery in a plane where the longitudinal axis is substantially normal to the plane. As an example, an apparatus can include a first housing that includes a display or displays (e.g., multiple displays on a single side and\/or displays on opposing sides). As an example, a latched state may be a first latched state where a first housing includes a display that is a front side display that is pivotable about an axle of a hinge assembly to face a front side of a second housing. As an example, a latched state may be a second latched state where first housing includes a display that is a front side display that is pivotable about an axle of a hinge assembly to face a back side of a second housing. As an example, a hinge assembly can include a first set of gears and a second set of gears and, for example, optionally one or more additional set of gears. As an example, a hinge assembly can include a first set of axles and a second set of axles and, for example, optionally one or more additional set of axles. As an example, a hinge assembly can include a set of axles that is a first set of axles and a set of gears that is a first set of gears and, for example, a second set of axles and a second set of gears. As an example, a latch can include a rotating hub operatively coupled to translating prongs, for example, where a first housing includes a socket (e.g., a receptacle) that receives portions of the translating prongs. As an example, a hinge assembly can include a first latch that, in a latched state, operatively couples a first housing to the hinge assembly, and a second latch that, in a latched state, operatively couples a second housing to the hinge assembly. In such an example, the hinge assembly can be separable from the first and second housings via the first latch being in an unlatched state and the second latch being in an unlatched state. As an example, a first housing can include a display and a second housing can include a keyboard. As an example, a hinge assembly can include gears that include teeth. As an example, a hinge assembly can include gears that include helical gears, for example, where the helical gears can include a clockwise helix gear and a counter-clockwise helix gear. As an example, a hinge assembly can include gears that include lobes. As an example, an apparatus can include a tablet housing and a base housing where a hinge assembly allows for snap\/detach\/reattach in one or more angular orientations. As an example, when attached, synchronization may exist between circuitry of the tablet housing and circuitry of the base housing. As an example, a positive snap-action may be utilized to attach and\/or detach with positive retention force. As an example, a hinge assembly can include latch portions that include relatively small prongs (e.g., protrusions, ears, etc.), which may not detract substantially from appearance (e.g., aesthetics). As some examples, consider that two housing, a housing and a hinge assembly, more than two housings, a combination of housings and hinge assemblies, etc. may be operatively coupled. In such examples, coupling may be electronically via wire and\/or wirelessly. In such example, coupling may be for purposes of air flow. As an example, at least a portion of hinge assembly may be covered, for example, by a hinge assembly housing, a cover, etc. As an example, a hinge assembly can include one or more components that may be covered by a cover that also covers at least a portion of one or more gears. As an example, a housing may be a stand, include one or more batteries, include one or more storage devices, include a charger, include a heat spreader plate, etc. As an example, a hinge assembly may provide for inclusion of one or more components that can provide one or more functions as to operation of circuitry of a housing or housings. As an example, an apparatus may be a two-in-one (e.g., ultra portable, convertible) apparatus. As an example, an apparatus can include a hinge assembly that allows for a multi-mode laptop, for example, to provide for a clamshell (e.g., with approximately 360 degree rotation) and, for example, stand, tent and tablet modes. As an example, an apparatus may offer a laptop mode and a detachable tablet (e.g., and\/or keyboard) mode. As an example, an apparatus can include a hinge assembly that can utilize a plurality of housings in various modes, which may correspond, at least in part, to orientations of one or more housings with respect to one or more hinge assemblies. The term \u201ccircuit\u201d or \u201ccircuitry\u201d is used in the summary, description, and\/or claims. As is well known in the art, the term \u201ccircuitry\u201d includes all levels of available integration, e.g., from discrete logic circuits to the highest level of circuit integration such as VLSI, and includes programmable logic components programmed to perform the functions of an embodiment as well as general-purpose or special-purpose processors programmed with instructions to perform those functions. Such circuitry may optionally rely on one or more computer-readable media that includes computer-executable instructions. As described herein, a computer-readable medium may be a storage device (e.g., a memory chip, a memory card, a storage disk, etc.) and referred to as a computer-readable storage medium. While various examples of circuits or circuitry have been discussed, FIG. 19 depicts a block diagram of an illustrative computer system 1900. The system 1900 may be a desktop computer system, such as one of the ThinkCentre\u00ae or ThinkPad\u00ae series of personal computers sold by Lenovo (US) Inc. of Morrisville, N.C., or a workstation computer, such as the ThinkStation\u00ae, which are sold by Lenovo (US) Inc. of Morrisville, N.C.; however, as apparent from the description herein, a satellite, a base, a server or other machine may include other features or only some of the features of the system 1900. As an example, a system such as the system 100 of FIG. 1 may include at least some of the features of the system 1900. As shown in FIG. 19, the system 1900 includes a so-called chipset 1910. A chipset refers to a group of integrated circuits, or chips, that are designed (e.g., configured) to work together. Chipsets are usually marketed as a single product (e.g., consider chipsets marketed under the brands INTEL\u00ae, AMD\u00ae, etc.). In the example of FIG. 19, the chipset 1910 has a particular architecture, which may vary to some extent depending on brand or manufacturer. The architecture of the chipset 1910 includes a core and memory control group 1920 and an I\/O controller hub 1950 that exchange information (e.g., data, signals, commands, etc.) via, for example, a direct management interface or direct media interface (DMI) 1942 or a link controller 1944. In the example of FIG. 19, the DMI 1942 is a chip-to-chip interface (sometimes referred to as being a link between a \u201cnorthbridge\u201d and a \u201csouthbridge\u201d). The core and memory control group 1920 include one or more processors 1922 (e.g., single core or multi-core) and a memory controller hub 1926 that exchange information via a front side bus (FSB) 1924. As described herein, various components of the core and memory control group 1920 may be integrated onto a single processor die, for example, to make a chip that supplants the conventional \u201cnorthbridge\u201d style architecture. The memory controller hub 1926 interfaces with memory 1940. For example, the memory controller hub 1926 may provide support for DDR SDRAM memory (e.g., DDR, DDR2, DDR3, etc.). In general, the memory 1940 is a type of random-access memory (RAM). It is often referred to as \u201csystem memory\u201d. The memory controller hub 1926 further includes a low-voltage differential signaling interface (LVDS) 1932. The LVDS 1932 may be a so-called LVDS Display Interface (LDI) for support of a display device 1992 (e.g., a CRT, a flat panel, a projector, etc.). A block 1938 includes some examples of technologies that may be supported via the LVDS interface 1932 (e.g., serial digital video, HDMI\/DVI, display port). The memory controller hub 1926 also includes one or more PCI-express interfaces (PCI-E) 1934, for example, for support of discrete graphics 1936. Discrete graphics using a PCI-E interface has become an alternative approach to an accelerated graphics port (AGP). For example, the memory controller hub 1926 may include a 16-lane (x16) PCI-E port for an external PCI-E-based graphics card. A system may include AGP or PCI-E for support of graphics. As described herein, a display may be a sensor display (e.g., configured for receipt of input using a stylus, a finger, etc.). As described herein, a sensor display may rely on resistive sensing, optical sensing, or other type of sensing. The I\/O hub controller 1950 includes a variety of interfaces. The example of FIG. 19 includes a SATA interface 1951, one or more PCI-E interfaces 1952 (optionally one or more legacy PCI interfaces), one or more USB interfaces 1953, a LAN interface 1954 (more generally a network interface), a general purpose I\/O interface (GPIO) 1955, a low-pin count (LPC) interface 1970, a power management interface 1961, a clock generator interface 1962, an audio interface 1963 (e.g., for speakers 1994), a total cost of operation (TCO) interface 1964, a system management bus interface (e.g., a multi-master serial computer bus interface) 1965, and a serial peripheral flash memory\/controller interface (SPI Flash) 1966, which, in the example of FIG. 19, includes BIOS 1968 and boot code 1990. With respect to network connections, the I\/O hub controller 1950 may include integrated gigabit Ethernet controller lines multiplexed with a PCI-E interface port. Other network features may operate independent of a PCI-E interface. The interfaces of the I\/O hub controller 1950 provide for communication with various devices, networks, etc. For example, the SATA interface 1951 provides for reading, writing or reading and writing information on one or more drives 1980 such as HDDs, SDDs or a combination thereof. The I\/O hub controller 1950 may also include an advanced host controller interface (AHCI) to support one or more drives 1980. The PCI-E interface 1952 allows for wireless connections 1982 to devices, networks, etc. The USB interface 1953 provides for input devices 1984 such as keyboards (KB), one or more optical sensors, mice and various other devices (e.g., microphones, cameras, phones, storage, media players, etc.). On or more other types of sensors may optionally rely on the USB interface 1953 or another interface (e.g., I2C, etc.). As to microphones, the system 1900 of FIG. 19 may include hardware (e.g., audio card) appropriately configured for receipt of sound (e.g., user voice, ambient sound, etc.). In the example of FIG. 19, the LPC interface 1970 provides for use of one or more ASICs 1971, a trusted platform module (TPM) 1972, a super I\/O 1973, a firmware hub 1974, BIOS support 1975 as well as various types of memory 1976 such as ROM 1977, Flash 1978, and non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) 1979. With respect to the TPM 1972, this module may be in the form of a chip that can be used to authenticate software and hardware devices. For example, a TPM may be capable of performing platform authentication and may be used to verify that a system seeking access is the expected system. The system 1900, upon power on, may be configured to execute boot code 1990 for the BIOS 1968, as stored within the SPI Flash 1966, and thereafter processes data under the control of one or more operating systems and application software (e.g., stored in system memory 1940). An operating system may be stored in any of a variety of locations and accessed, for example, according to instructions of the BIOS 1968. Again, as described herein, a satellite, a base, a server or other machine may include fewer or more features than shown in the system 1900 of FIG. 19. Further, the system 1900 of FIG. 19 is shown as optionally include cell phone circuitry 1995, which may include GSM, CDMA, etc., types of circuitry configured for coordinated operation with one or more of the other features of the system 1900. Also shown in FIG. 19 is battery circuitry 1997, which may provide one or more battery, power, etc., associated features (e.g., optionally to instruct one or more other components of the system 1900). As an example, a SMBus may be operable via a LPC (see, e.g., the LPC interface 1970), via an I2C interface (see, e.g., the SM\/I2C interface 1965), etc. Although examples of methods, devices, systems, etc., have been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather, the specific features and acts are disclosed as examples of forms of implementing the claimed methods, devices, systems, etc.","cpc_label":"G06F11681","ipc_label":"G06F116","filing_date":"20160102","patent_issue_date":"","date_published":"20170706","examiner_id":"67191.0","input_text":"<s>[INST] Given the following patent invention description: , in the context of the novelty:  An apparatus can include a processor; memory accessible by the processor; a second housing that includes a front side and a back side; a hinge assembly operatively coupled to the second housing .

Online systems, such as social networking systems, allow users to connect to and to communicate with other users of the online system. Users may create profiles on an online system that are tied to their identities and include information about the users, such as interests and demographic information. The users may be individuals or entities such as corporations or charities. Online systems allow users to easily communicate and to share content with other online system users by providing content to an online system for presentation to other users. Content provided to an online system by a user may be declarative information provided by a user, status updates, check-ins to locations, images, photographs, videos, text data, or any other information a user wishes to share with additional users of the online system. An online system may also generate content for presentation to a user, such as content describing actions taken by other users on the online system. Additionally, many online systems commonly allow users (e.g., businesses) to sponsor presentation of content on an online system to gain public attention for a user's products or services or to persuade other users to take an action regarding the user's products or services. Content for which the online system receives compensation in exchange for presenting to users is referred to as \u201csponsored content.\u201d Many online systems receive compensation from a user for presenting online system users with certain types of sponsored content provided by the user. Frequently, online systems charge a user for each presentation of sponsored content to an online system user or for each interaction with sponsored content by an online system user. For example, an online system receives compensation from an entity each time a content item provided by the user is displayed to another user on the online system or each time another user is presented with a content item on the online system and interacts with the content item (e.g., selects a link included in the content item), or each time another user performs another action after being presented with the content item. As a relatively limited number of users of an online system may frequently interact with sponsored content provided by the online system, competition for presenting sponsored content to those users may result in larger amounts of compensation to the online system, which limits the number of users capable of providing the amounts of compensation. However, other online system users may view sponsored content for long amounts of time, which increases likelihoods of the users subsequently recalling the sponsored content and taking an action. For example, a user may make a purchase from a business identified by sponsored content the user views for greater than a particular amount of time even if the user does not interact with the sponsored content while it is presented. While users sponsoring content presented by an online system may obtain benefits from sponsored content presented by the online system but with which online system users do not interact, conventional online systems select sponsored content for presentation to users based on likelihoods of interaction with sponsored content. This may limit the sponsored content presented by an online system.","summary":"<SOH> SUMMARY <EOH>An online system receives advertisement requests (\u201cad requests\u201d) that each include an advertisement for presentation to one or more users of the online system and a bid amount specifying an amount of compensation a user associated with an ad request provides the online system for presenting the advertisement from the ad request to another user. An ad request may also include targeting criteria specifying characteristics of users eligible to be presented with the advertisement included in the ad request. When the online system identifies an opportunity to present an advertisement from an ad request to a viewing user, the online system identifies ad requests eligible for presentation to the viewing user (i.e., ad requests including at least a threshold number of targeting criteria satisfied by characteristics of the viewing user) and selects an ad request from the identified ad requests. The online system then presents an advertisement from the selected ad request. For example, the online system includes the advertisement from the selected ad request in a feed of content selected for the viewing user by the online system. In various embodiments, the online system maintains information identifying advertisements presented to the viewing user along with amounts of time that at least a threshold amount of the advertisements were presented to the viewing user via a client device. For example, the online system receives information from an application associated with the online system and executing on a client device specifying a time when a portion of an advertisement (e.g., a top boundary of the advertisement) is presented on a display of the client device and a time when a portion of an additional content item (e.g., a top boundary of the additional content item) stops being presented by the client device or when a portion of the advertisement stops being presented by the client device. In a specific example, the online system receives an identifier associated with a user and an identifier associated with an advertisement and a time when the top boundary of the advertisement is presented by the client device and subsequently receives a time when a top boundary of a content item presented in a lower position than the advertisement is no longer presented by the client device. The online system determines a difference between the time of presentation of the portion of the advertisement by the client device and the time the portion of the additional content item stops being presented as the duration the advertisement was presented to the user and stores the duration in association with the user and with the advertisement. As another example, the online system receives the identifier associated with the advertisement and the time when the top boundary of the advertisement is presented by the client device and subsequently receives a time when a lower boundary of the advertisement is no longer presented by the client device. The online system determines a difference between the time when the top boundary of the advertisement is presented and the time the bottom boundary of the advertisement as the duration the advertisement was presented to the user and stores the duration in association with the advertisement and with the user. Based on durations of advertisements previously presented to the viewing user or other users having at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of characteristics matching characteristics of the viewing user, the online system determines a likelihood of the viewing user viewing an advertisement for an amount of time within a specific range. The specific range includes amounts of time resulting in at least a threshold likelihood of the viewing user subsequently recalling the advertisement, which may increase the likelihood of the viewing user subsequently performing one or more actions associated with the advertisement (e.g., purchasing a product or service identified by the advertisement, accessing content identified by the advertisement, etc.). In various embodiments, the online system determines the specific range based on amounts of time that other users have viewed various advertisements. In some embodiments, the other users have at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of characteristics (e.g., an age range, a location, a gender, etc.) matching characteristics of the user. For example, the specific range is includes amounts of time the other users have viewed the one or more advertisements between an upper boundary and a lower boundary in a ranking of the amounts of time the other users have viewed the one or more advertisements (e.g., amounts of time within the 75 th and 95 th percentile of amounts of times) the other users have viewed various advertisements. As a particular example, the specific range is between the 75 th and 95 th percentile of amounts of times that other users associated with a location matching a location of the viewing user have viewed the advertisement. In some embodiments, the online system determines the specific range based on amounts of times the other users viewed advertisements having one or more particular characteristics. In various embodiments, the online system maintains a model associated with the viewing user that determines a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement in an ad request. The model associated with the viewing user determines a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement based on characteristics of the advertisement, amounts of time the user or other users viewed previously presented advertisements, and characteristics of the viewing user. For example, the model determines a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement based on amounts of times other users viewed previously presented advertisements having characteristics matching characteristics of the advertisement. Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the model determines a likelihood of a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement being within the specific range. When the online system identifies an opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user, the online system identifies ad requests eligible for presentation to the user and determines predicted amounts of time the user will view advertisements in various identified ad requests. The online system selects an ad request including an advertisement for presentation to the user based in part on the predicted amounts of time the user will view advertisements in various identified ad requests. In various embodiments, the online system determines a score for the ad request including the advertisement based on a bid amount included in the ad request and a likelihood of the viewing user interacting with the advertisement and increases the score if the predicted amount of time the viewing user will view the advertisement is within the specific range. The online system similarly determines scores for other ad requests eligible for presentation to the viewing user and selects an ad request including an advertisement for presentation to the user based on the scores. When an advertisement from the selected ad request is presented to the viewing user, the online system receives information identifying an amount of time the advertisement from the selected ad request was viewed by the user. The online system modifies the model associated with the user based on characteristics of the advertisement from the selected ad request and the amount of time the advertisement from the selected ad request was viewed by the viewing user. Additionally, the online system modifies the specific range of amounts of time for users having at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of characteristics matching characteristics of the viewing user to view the advertisement from the selected ad request based on the amount of time the viewing user views the advertisement from the selected ad request.","description":"BACKGROUND This disclosure relates generally to online systems, and more specifically to selecting content to online system users to increase likelihood of users later recalling the content.

The online system determines a difference between the time when the top boundary of the advertisement is presented and the time the bottom boundary of the advertisement as the duration the advertisement was presented to the user and stores the duration in association with the advertisement and with the user. Based on durations of advertisements previously presented to the viewing user or other users having at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of characteristics matching characteristics of the viewing user, the online system determines a likelihood of the viewing user viewing an advertisement for an amount of time within a specific range. The specific range includes amounts of time resulting in at least a threshold likelihood of the viewing user subsequently recalling the advertisement, which may increase the likelihood of the viewing user subsequently performing one or more actions associated with the advertisement (e.g., purchasing a product or service identified by the advertisement, accessing content identified by the advertisement, etc.). In various embodiments, the online system determines the specific range based on amounts of time that other users have viewed various advertisements. In some embodiments, the other users have at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of characteristics (e.g., an age range, a location, a gender, etc.) matching characteristics of the user. For example, the specific range is includes amounts of time the other users have viewed the one or more advertisements between an upper boundary and a lower boundary in a ranking of the amounts of time the other users have viewed the one or more advertisements (e.g., amounts of time within the 75th and 95th percentile of amounts of times) the other users have viewed various advertisements. As a particular example, the specific range is between the 75th and 95th percentile of amounts of times that other users associated with a location matching a location of the viewing user have viewed the advertisement. In some embodiments, the online system determines the specific range based on amounts of times the other users viewed advertisements having one or more particular characteristics. In various embodiments, the online system maintains a model associated with the viewing user that determines a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement in an ad request. The model associated with the viewing user determines a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement based on characteristics of the advertisement, amounts of time the user or other users viewed previously presented advertisements, and characteristics of the viewing user. For example, the model determines a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement based on amounts of times other users viewed previously presented advertisements having characteristics matching characteristics of the advertisement. Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the model determines a likelihood of a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement being within the specific range. When the online system identifies an opportunity to present one or more advertisements to the user, the online system identifies ad requests eligible for presentation to the user and determines predicted amounts of time the user will view advertisements in various identified ad requests. The online system selects an ad request including an advertisement for presentation to the user based in part on the predicted amounts of time the user will view advertisements in various identified ad requests. In various embodiments, the online system determines a score for the ad request including the advertisement based on a bid amount included in the ad request and a likelihood of the viewing user interacting with the advertisement and increases the score if the predicted amount of time the viewing user will view the advertisement is within the specific range. The online system similarly determines scores for other ad requests eligible for presentation to the viewing user and selects an ad request including an advertisement for presentation to the user based on the scores. When an advertisement from the selected ad request is presented to the viewing user, the online system receives information identifying an amount of time the advertisement from the selected ad request was viewed by the user. The online system modifies the model associated with the user based on characteristics of the advertisement from the selected ad request and the amount of time the advertisement from the selected ad request was viewed by the viewing user. Additionally, the online system modifies the specific range of amounts of time for users having at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of characteristics matching characteristics of the viewing user to view the advertisement from the selected ad request based on the amount of time the viewing user views the advertisement from the selected ad request.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION System Architecture FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system environment 100 for an online system 140. The system environment 100 shown by FIG. 1 comprises one or more client devices 110, a network 120, one or more third-party systems 130, and the online system 140. In alternative configurations, different and\/or additional components may be included in the system environment 100. The online system 140 may be a social networking system, a content sharing networks, or other system providing content to users. The client devices 110 are one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and\/or receiving data via the network 120. In one embodiment, a client device 110 is a conventional computer system, such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Alternatively, a client device 110 may be a device having computer functionality, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a smartphone, a smartwatch, or another suitable device. A client device 110 is configured to communicate via the network 120. In one embodiment, a client device 110 executes an application allowing a user of the client device 110 to interact with the online system 140. For example, a client device 110 executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device 110 and the online system 140 via the network 120. In another embodiment, a client device 110 interacts with the online system 140 through an application programming interface (API) running on a native operating system of the client device 110, such as IOS\u00ae or ANDROID\u2122. The client devices 110 are configured to communicate via the network 120, which may comprise any combination of local area and\/or wide area networks, using both wired and\/or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment, the network 120 uses standard communications technologies and\/or protocols. For example, the network 120 includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet, 802.11, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), 3G, 4G, code division multiple access (CDMA), digital subscriber line (DSL), etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network 120 include multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP), hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and file transfer protocol (FTP). Data exchanged over the network 120 may be represented using any suitable format, such as hypertext markup language (HTML) or extensible markup language (XML). In some embodiments, all or some of the communication links of the network 120 may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques. One or more third party systems 130 may be coupled to the network 120 for communicating with the online system 140, which is further described below in conjunction with FIG. 2. In one embodiment, a third party system 130 is an application provider communicating information describing applications for execution by a client device 110 or communicating data to client devices 110 for use by an application executing on the client device 110. In other embodiments, a third party system 130 provides content or other information for presentation via a client device 110. A third party system 130 may also communicate information to the online system 140, such as advertisements, content, or information about an application provided by the third party system 130. In some embodiments, one or more of the third party systems 130 provide content to the online system 140 for presentation to users of the online system 140 and provide compensation to the online system 140 in exchange for presenting the content. For example, a third party system 130 provides advertisement requests, which are further described below in conjunction with FIG. 2, including advertisements for presentation and amounts of compensation provided by the third party system 130 to the online system 140 in exchange presenting the advertisements to the online system 140. Content presented by the online system 140 for which the online system 140 receives compensation in exchange for presenting is referred to herein as \u201csponsored content,\u201d \u201csponsored content items,\u201d or \u201cadvertisements.\u201d Sponsored content from a third party system 130 may be associated with the third party system 130 or with another entity on whose behalf the third party system 130 operates. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an architecture of the online system 140. The online system 140 shown in FIG. 2 includes a user profile store 205, a content store 210, an action logger 215, an action log 220, an edge store 225, an advertisement (\u201cad\u201d) request store 230, a content selection module 235, and a web server 240. In other embodiments, the online system 140 may include additional, fewer, or different components for various applications. Conventional components such as network interfaces, security functions, load balancers, failover servers, management and network operations consoles, and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system architecture. Each user of the online system 140 is associated with a user profile, which is stored in the user profile store 205. A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the online system 140. In one embodiment, a user profile includes multiple data fields, each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding online system user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic, demographic, and other types of descriptive information, such as work experience, educational history, gender, hobbies or preferences, location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user, for example, images or videos. In certain embodiments, images of users may be tagged with information identifying the online system users displayed in an image, with information identifying the images in which a user is tagged stored in the user profile of the user. A user profile in the user profile store 205 may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store 210 and stored in the action log 220. While user profiles in the user profile store 205 are frequently associated with individuals, allowing individuals to interact with each other via the online system 140, user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the online system 140 for connecting and exchanging content with other online system users. The entity may post information about itself, about its products or provide other information to users of the online system 140 using a brand page associated with the entity's user profile. Other users of the online system 140 may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself, providing users with background or informational data about the entity. In some embodiments, the brand page associated with the entity's user profile may retrieve information from one or more user profiles associated with users who have interacted with the brand page or with other content associated with the entity, allowing the brand page to include information personalized to a user when presented to the user. The content store 210 stores objects that each represents various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post, a status update, a photograph, a video, a link, a shared content item, a gaming application achievement, a check-in event at a local business, a brand page, or any other type of content. Online system users may create objects stored by the content store 210, such as status updates, photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the online system 140, events, groups or applications. In some embodiments, objects are received from third-party applications or third-party applications separate from the online system 140. In one embodiment, objects in the content store 210 represent single pieces of content, or content \u201citems.\u201d Hence, online system users are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media to the online system 140 through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the online system 140. The action logger 215 receives communications about user actions internal to and\/or external to the online system 140, populating the action log 220 with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user, sending a message to another user, uploading an image, reading a message from another user, viewing content associated with another user, and attending an event posted by another user. In addition, a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users, so these actions are associated with the particular users as well and stored in the action log 220. In various embodiments, the action logger 215 receives information from an application associated with the online system 140 executing on various client devices 110 identifying times when content items were presented to users of the online system 140 by the client devices 110. For example, the action logger 215 receives a time when a portion of a content item was presented to a user by a client device 110 and a time when an additional portion of the content item stopped being presented to the user by the client device 110. In a specific example, the action logger 215 receives a time when a top boundary of a content item was presented by the client device 110 and a time when a lower boundary of the content item stopped being presented by the client device 110. Alternatively, the action logger 215 receives times when a portion of a content item was presented to a user by a client device 110 and when the portion of the content item stopped being presented to the user by the client device 110. For example, the action logger 215 receives times when top boundary of a content item was presented to a user by a client device 110 and when the top boundary of the content item stopped being presented to the user by the client device 110. Based on the received information, the action logger 215 determines an amount of time a user viewed a content item and stores the amount of time in the action log 220 in association with an identifier of the content item and an identifier of the user. If the action logger 215 receives times when a portion of a content item was presented to a user by a client device 110 and a time when an additional portion of the content item stopped being presented to the user by the client device 110, the action logger 215 determines the amount of time the user viewed the content item as a difference between the time when the additional portion of the content item stopped being presented and the time when the portion of the content item was presented. For example, the amount of time the user viewed a content item is a difference between a time when a lower boundary of the content item stopped being presented by a client device 110 and a time when a top boundary of the content item was presented by the client device 110. If the action logger 215 receives times when a portion of a content item was presented to a user by a client device 110 and when the portion of the content item stopped being presented to the user by the client device 110, the action logger 215 determines an amount of time the user viewed the content item as a difference between a time when the portion of a content item having a lower position than the content item in a feed of content stopped being presented and a time when the portion of the content item was presented. For example, the amount of time the user views a content item is a difference between a time a client device 110 stopped presenting a top boundary of another content item having a position in the feed of content below a position of the content item (e.g., an adjacent position to the position of the content item in the feed) and a time the client device 110 presented the top boundary of the content item. The action log 220 may be used by the online system 140 to track user actions on the online system 140, as well as actions on third party systems 130 that communicate information to the online system 140. Users may interact with various objects on the online system 140, and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log 220. Examples of interactions with objects include: commenting on posts, sharing links, checking-in to physical locations via a client device 110, accessing content items, and any other suitable interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the online system 140 that are included in the action log 220 include: commenting on a photo album, communicating with a user, establishing a connection with an object, joining an event, joining a group, creating an event, authorizing an application, using an application, expressing a preference for an object (\u201cliking\u201d the object), engaging in a transaction, viewing an object (e.g., a content item), and sharing an object (e.g., a content item) with another user. Additionally, the action log 220 may record a user's interactions with advertisements on the online system 140 as well as with other applications operating on the online system 140. In some embodiments, data from the action log 220 is used to infer interests or preferences of a user, augmenting the interests included in the user's user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences. The action log 220 may also store user actions taken on a third party system 130, such as an external website, and communicated to the online system 140. For example, an e-commerce website may recognize a user of an online system 140 through a social plug-in enabling the e-commerce website to identify the user of the online system 140. Because users of the online system 140 are uniquely identifiable, e-commerce websites, such as in the preceding example, may communicate information about a user's actions outside of the online system 140 to the online system 140 for association with the user. Hence, the action log 220 may record information about actions users perform on a third party system 130, including webpage viewing histories, advertisements that were engaged, purchases made, and other patterns from shopping and buying. Additionally, actions a user performs via an application associated with a third party system 130 and executing on a client device 110 may be communicated to the action logger 215 by the application for recordation and association with the user in the action log 220. In one embodiment, the edge store 225 stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the online system 140 as edges. Some edges may be defined by users, allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example, users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users' real-life relationships, such as friends, co-workers, partners, and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the online system 140, such as expressing interest in a page on the online system 140, sharing a link with other users of the online system 140, and commenting on posts made by other users of the online system 140. In one embodiment, an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users, interactions between users and objects, or interactions between objects. For example, features included in an edge describe a rate of interaction between two users, how recently two users have interacted with each other, a rate or an amount of information retrieved by one user about an object, or numbers and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or a particular user. For example, a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic, the rate at which the user logs into the online system 140, or information describing demographic information about the user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user, a target object or user, and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user, the target object or user, or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user; hence, an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions. The edge store 225 also stores information about edges, such as affinity scores for objects, interests, and other users. Affinity scores, or \u201caffinities,\u201d may be computed by the online system 140 over time to approximate a user's interest in an object or in another user in the online system 140 based on the actions performed by the user. A user's affinity may be computed by the online system 140 over time to approximate the user's interest in an object, in a topic, or in another user in the online system 140 based on actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/978,265, filed on Dec. 23, 2010, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/690,254, filed on Nov. 30, 2012, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/689,969, filed on Nov. 30, 2012, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/690,088, filed on Nov. 30, 2012, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store 225, in one embodiment. Alternatively, each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments, connections between users may be stored in the user profile store 205, or the user profile store 205 may access the edge store 225 to determine connections between users. One or more advertisement requests (\u201cad requests\u201d) are included in the ad request store 230. An ad request includes advertisement content, also referred to as an \u201cadvertisement,\u201d and a bid amount. The advertisement is text, image, audio, video, or any other suitable data presented to a user. In various embodiments, the advertisement also includes a landing page specifying a network address to which a user is directed when the advertisement content is accessed. The bid amount is associated with an ad request by an advertiser and is used to determine an expected value, such as monetary compensation, provided by the advertiser to the online system 140 if an advertisement in the ad request is presented to a user, if the advertisement in the ad request receives a user interaction when presented, or if any suitable condition is satisfied when the advertisement in the ad request is presented to a user. For example, the bid amount specifies a monetary amount that the online system 140 receives from the advertiser if an advertisement in an ad request is displayed. In some embodiments, the expected value to the online system 140 of presenting the advertisement may be determined by multiplying the bid amount by a probability of the advertisement being accessed by a user. Additionally, an ad request may include one or more targeting criteria specified by the advertiser. Targeting criteria included in an ad request specify one or more characteristics of users eligible to be presented with advertisement content in the ad request. For example, targeting criteria are used to identify users having user profile information, edges, or actions satisfying at least one of the targeting criteria. Hence, targeting criteria allow an advertiser to identify users having specific characteristics, simplifying subsequent distribution of content to different users. In one embodiment, targeting criteria may specify actions or types of connections between a user and another user or object of the online system 140. Targeting criteria may also specify interactions between a user and objects performed external to the online system 140, such as on a third party system 130. For example, targeting criteria identifies users who have taken a particular action, such as sent a message to another user, used an application, joined a group, left a group, joined an event, generated an event description, purchased or reviewed a product or service using an online marketplace, requested information from a third party system 130, installed an application, or performed any other suitable action. Including actions in targeting criteria allows advertisers to further refine users eligible to be presented with advertisement content from an ad request. As another example, targeting criteria identifies users having a connection to another user or object or having a particular type of connection to another user or object. The content selection module 235 selects one or more content items for communication to a client device 110 to be presented to a user. Content items eligible for presentation to the user are retrieved from the content store 210, from the ad request store 230, or from another source by the content selection module 235, which selects one or more of the content items for presentation to the user. A content item eligible for presentation to the user is a content item associated with at least a threshold number of targeting criteria satisfied by characteristics of the user or is a content item that is not associated with targeting criteria. In various embodiments, the content selection module 235 includes content items eligible for presentation to the user in one or more selection processes, which identify a set of content items for presentation to the user. For example, the content selection module 235 determines measures of relevance of various content items to the user based on characteristics associated with the user by the online system 140 and based on the user's affinity for different content items. Information associated with the user included in the user profile store 205, in the action log 220, and in the edge store 225 may be used to determine the measures of relevance. Based on the measures of relevance, the content selection module 235 selects content items for presentation to the user. As an additional example, the content selection module 235 selects content items having the highest measures of relevance or having at least a threshold measure of relevance for presentation to the user. Alternatively, the content selection module 235 ranks content items based on their associated measures of relevance and selects content items having the highest positions in the ranking or having at least a threshold position in the ranking for presentation to the user. Content items selected for presentation to the user may include advertisements from ad requests or other content items associated with bid amounts. The content selection module 235 uses the bid amounts associated with ad requests when selecting content for presentation to the viewing user. In various embodiments, the content selection module 235 determines an expected value associated with various ad requests (or other content items) based on their bid amounts and selects advertisements from ad requests associated with a maximum expected value or associated with at least a threshold expected value for presentation. An expected value associated with an ad request or with a content item represents an expected amount of compensation to the online system 140 for presenting an advertisement from the ad request or for presenting the content item. For example, the expected value associated with an ad request is a product of the ad request's bid amount and a likelihood of the user interacting with the ad content from the ad request. The content selection module 235 may rank ad requests based on their associated bid amounts and select advertisements from ad requests having at least a threshold position in the ranking for presentation to the user. In some embodiments, the content selection module 235 ranks both content items not associated with bid amounts and ad requests in a unified ranking based on bid amounts associated with ad requests and measures of relevance associated with content items and with ad requests. Based on the unified ranking, the content selection module 235 selects content for presentation to the user. Selecting ad requests and other content items through a unified ranking is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/545,266, filed on Jul. 10, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In various embodiments, the content selection module 235 maintains models associated with various users that determine predicted amounts of time users will view content items, such as advertisements. Hence, a model associated with a user predicts an amount of time the user will view a content item based on characteristics of the content item. The content selection module 235 determines a model associated with a user from amounts of times users having at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of characteristics matching characteristics of the user have viewed content items. Hence, the model associated with the user determines a predicted amount of time the user will view a content item based on amounts of times users having at least the threshold number or at least the threshold percentage previously viewed content items having characteristics matching characteristics of the content item. Additionally, the content selection module 235 determines specific ranges of times for various users to view a content item and subsequently recall the content item based on the amounts of times users viewed various content items from the action log 220. For example, a specific range includes amounts of time resulting in at least a threshold likelihood of a user subsequently recalling a content item after presentation of the content item, which may increase the likelihood of the user subsequently performing one or more actions associated with the content item (e.g., purchasing a product or service identified by the content item, accessing content identified by the content item, etc.). In some embodiments, the content selection module 235 determines a specific range of times for various groups of users, with each group having at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of common characteristics. In various embodiments, the online system 140 ranks the amounts of time multiple users, such as users having at least the threshold number or the threshold percentage of common characteristics, have viewed content items and determines the specific range based on the ranking. For example, the specific range includes amounts of times between a lower boundary position in the ranking and an upper boundary position in the ranking. In a specific example, the online system 140 determines the specific range as times between a 75th percentile and a 95th percentile of amounts of times various users viewed content items. When selecting advertisements, or other content items, for presentation to a user, the content selection module 235 accounts for a predicted amount of time the user will view various content items being within a specific range of times associated with the user. Presenting the user with a content item that the user is predicted to view for an amount of time sufficient for the user to subsequently recall the content item may increase the likelihood of the user subsequently performing an action associated with the content item. This increased likelihood of user interaction increases revenue provided to the online system 140 by users compensating the online system 140 for presenting content items. Selecting content items based at least in part on predicted amounts of time a user will view the content items is further described below in conjunction with FIG. 3. For example, the content selection module 235 receives a request to present a feed of content (also referred to as a \u201ccontent feed\u201d) to a user of the online system 140. The feed may include one or more advertisements as well as content items, such as stories describing actions associated with other online system users connected to the user. The content selection module 235 accesses one or more of the user profile store 205, the content store 210, the action log 220, and the edge store 225 to retrieve information about the user and selects content items based on the retrieved information. For example, information describing actions associated with other users connected to the user or other data associated with users connected to the user is retrieved and used to select content items describing actions associated with one or more of the other users. Additionally, one or more ad requests may be retrieved from the ad request store 230. The retrieved ad requests and other content items are analyzed by the content selection module 235 to identify candidate content items that are likely to be relevant to the user. For example, content items associated with users who not connected to the user or content items associated with users for whom the user has less than a threshold affinity are discarded as candidate content items. Based on various criteria, the content selection module 235 selects one or more of the candidate content items or ad requests identified as candidate content items for presentation to the user. The selected content items or advertisements from selected ad requests are included in a feed of content that is presented to the user. For example, the feed of content includes at least a threshold number of content items describing actions associated with users connected to the user via the online system 140. In various embodiments, the content selection module 235 presents content to a user through a feed including a plurality of content items selected for presentation to the user. One or more advertisements may also be included in the feed. The content selection module 235 may also determine an order in which selected content items or advertisements are presented via the feed. For example, the content selection module 235 orders content items or advertisements in the feed based on likelihoods of the user interacting with various content items or advertisements. When video data provided by a user to the online system 140 is presented to an additional user of the online system 140, the content selection module 235 may select one or more ad requests from the ad request store 230 that include advertisements for presentation via the video data at different positions. To include advertisements in video data provided by the user while minimizing disruption of interaction with the video data, the content selection module 235 receives information from the user providing the video data to the online system 140 indicating positions in the video data capable of presenting an advertisement. For example, the user communicates information to the content selection module 235 identifying a time in the video data during which an advertisement is capable of being presented or identifying a time in the video data and a duration after the identified time during which one or more advertisements are capable of being presented. Additionally, the information received from the user who provided the video data to the online system 140 may also include information for selecting an ad request including an advertisement for presentation via the video data at an identified time. For example, the received information includes an identifier of a specific ad request in association with an identified time in the video data to present an advertisement from the specific ad request at the identified time in the video data. Alternatively, the received information includes information describing a context of the video data at an identified time capable of presenting an advertisement. For example, the received information identifies one or more keywords associated with an identified time of the video data, so the content selection module 235 selects an ad request including at least a threshold amount of targeting criteria satisfied by the keywords for presentation at the identified time. Additionally, the content selection module 235 may select an ad request for presentation at the identified time based at least in part on characteristics of an additional user presented with the video data by identifying one or more ad requests including at least a threshold amount of targeting criteria satisfied by received information from the user and characteristics associated with the additional user maintained by the online system 140. Selection of advertisements for presentation via video data provided by a user to the online system 140 is further described below in conjunction with FIG. 3. The web server 240 links the online system 140 via the network 120 to the one or more client devices 110, as well as to the one or more third party systems 130. The web server 240 serves web pages, as well as other content, such as JAVA\u00ae, FLASH\u00ae, XML and so forth. The web server 240 may receive and route messages between the online system 140 and the client device 110, for example, instant messages, queued messages (e.g., email), text messages, short message service (SMS) messages, or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server 240 to upload information (e.g., images or videos) that are stored in the content store 210. Additionally, the web server 240 may provide application programming interface (API) functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems, such as IOS\u00ae, ANDROID\u2122, WEBOS\u00ae or BlackberryOS. Selecting Advertisements Based in Part on Predicted User Viewing Time FIG. 3 is a flowchart of one embodiment of a method for selecting advertisements for presentation to a viewing user based on a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view advertisements. In other embodiments, the method may include different and\/or additional steps than those shown in FIG. 3. Additionally, steps of the method may be performed in different orders than the order described in conjunction with FIG. 3 in various embodiments. An online system 140 receives 305 advertisement requests (\u201cad requests\u201d) from one or more users. As described above in conjunction with FIG. 2, each ad request includes an advertisement for presentation to one or more users of the online system 140 and a bid amount specifying an amount of compensation a user associated with an ad request provides the online system 140 in exchange presenting the advertisement from the ad request to another user or in exchange for another user interacting with the advertisement when it is presented. An ad request may also include targeting criteria specifying characteristics of users eligible to be presented with the advertisement included in the ad request, as described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. Additionally, the online system 140 receives 310 information from various client devices 110 presenting content from the online system 140 identifying times online system users viewed content items from the online system 140. In various embodiments, an application associated with the online system 140 executes on a client device 110 and presents content items from the online system 140 to a user via the client device 110. When the application associated with the online system 140 presents a portion of a content item, such as an advertisement, the application communicates an identifier associated with the user, an identifier associated with the content item, and a time when the portion of the content item was presented on a display device of the client device 110 by the application to the online system 140. For example, when a top boundary of an advertisement is presented to a user by the display device of the client device 110, the application associated with the online system 140 communicates information identifying the user, identifying the advertisement, and the time when the top boundary of the advertisement was presented to the online system 140. In some embodiments, the application also communicates a time when an additional portion of the content item stops being presented by the display device of the client device 110 along with the identifier associated with the user and the identifier associated with the content item. For example, the online system 140 receives 310 a time when a bottom boundary of the advertisement stops being presented by the display device of the client device 110. Alternatively, the application associated with the online system 140 communicates times when the he application also communicates a time when the portion of various content items stops being presented by the display device of the client device 110. For example, the application communicates times when a top boundary of each content item from the online system 140 stops being presented by the display device of the client device 110 along with identifiers associated with the content items and an identifier associated with the user. Based on the received information, the online system 140 determines 315 amounts of times various content items, such as advertisements, were presented to one or more users. When the online system 140 receives a time when a portion of a content item was presented to a user by a client device 110 and a time when an additional portion of the content item stopped being presented to the user by the client device 110, the online system 140 determines 315 an amount of time the content item was presented to the user as a difference between the time when the additional portion of the content item stopped being presented to the user and the time when the portion of the content item was presented to the viewing user. For example, the online system 140 determines 315 the amount of time an advertisement was presented to the user as a difference between a time when a bottom boundary of the advertisement stopped being presented to the user and a time when a top boundary of the advertisement was presented to the user. When the online system 140 receives a time when a portion of a content item was presented to the user by a client device 110 and a time when the portion of the content item stopped being presented to the user by the client device 110, the online system 140 determines 315 the amount of time a content item was presented to the user as a difference between a time when the portion of the content item was presented to the user and a time when the portion of an additional content item adjacent to the content item stopped being presented to the user. For example, the online system 140 determines 315 the amount of time an advertisement was presented to the user as a difference between a time when a top boundary of a content item adjacent to the advertisement stopped being presented to the user and a time when the top boundary of the advertisement was presented to the user. In various embodiments, the one or more users for whom the online system 140 determines the amounts of times various content items were presented to the users include a viewing user. For various content items, the online system 140 stores an identifier of a content item and an amount of time the content item was presented to the viewing user in association with the viewing user. The online system 140 maintains amounts of times different users have viewed different content items. In some embodiments, the online system 140 maintains amounts of times each user have viewed content items presented to the users within a threshold amount of time from a current time. Based on amounts of times various users have viewed different content items, the online system 140 determines 320 a specific range of times for the viewing user. In some embodiments, the online system 140 determines a specific range of time for a set of users having at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of characteristics matching characteristics of the viewing user. The specific range of times includes amounts of time for presenting a content item to the viewing user causing the viewing user to subsequently recall the content item and perform one or more actions. For example, the specific range includes amounts of time resulting in at least a threshold likelihood of the viewing user subsequently recalling the content item after presentation of the content item, which may increase the likelihood of the viewing user subsequently performing one or more actions associated with the content item (e.g., purchasing a product or service identified by the content item, accessing content identified by the content item, etc.). In various embodiments, the online system 140 ranks the amounts of time multiple users have viewed content items and determines 320 the specific range based on the ranking. For example, the specific range includes amounts of times between a lower boundary position in the ranking and an upper boundary position in the ranking. In a specific example, the online system 140 determines 320 the specific range as times between a 75th percentile and a 95th percentile of amounts of times various users viewed content items. The online system 140 may determine 320 the specific range based on amounts of time that users in a set viewed content items. In various embodiments, users in the set have at least a threshold number of characteristics matching characteristics of the viewing user. For example, users in the set each have a gender or a location matching a gender or a location of the viewing user, so the online system 140 determines 320 the specific range based on amounts of time that users having a common gender or a common location with the viewing user have viewed content items. Any suitable characteristic or combination of characteristics may be used by the online system 140 to identify the set of users. In some embodiments, the online system 140 determines a specific range for multiple sets of users, with each set including users having a different common characteristic or a different combination of common characteristics. The online system 140 stores the specific range in association with the users in the set or in association with an identifier of the set that is associated with identifiers of users included in the set. Additionally, the online system 140 generates 325 one or more models associated with the viewing user based on the amounts of times users have viewed different content items. A model associated with the viewing user determines an estimated amount of time the viewing user will view a content item, such as an advertisement, based on characteristics of the viewing user and characteristics of the content item. The online system 140 may generate 325 a model associated with the viewing user based on amounts of time other users having at least a threshold number or a threshold of percentage of characteristics matching characteristics of the viewing user and characteristics of content items viewed by the other users. The model may also account for amounts of time the viewing user has viewed content items and characteristics of the content items previously viewed by the viewing user. In some embodiments, the model determines predicted amounts of time the user will view specific types of content items, such as advertisements, based on amounts of time that the other users have viewed the specific types of content items, characteristics of the viewing user, and amounts of time the viewing user or other users have viewed previously presented content items, a model associated with the viewing user determines a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view the content item. The online system 140 stores the generated model in association with the viewing user. When the online system 140 identifies 330 an opportunity to present an advertisement from an ad request to the viewing user, the online system 140 identifies ad requests eligible for presentation to the viewing user (i.e., ad requests including at least a threshold number of targeting criteria satisfied by characteristics of the viewing user) and determines 335 a predicted amount of time the user will view advertisements from various identified ad requests. In various embodiments, the online system 140 determines 335 a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement from each identified ad request. For example, the online system 140 applies the one or more models associated with the viewing user to advertisements from each identified ad request to determine 335 the predicted amounts of time the viewing user will view each of the advertisements from the identified ad requests. The model determines 335 a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view an advertisement from an identified ad request based on amounts of times the other users or the viewing user have viewed advertisements having characteristics matching characteristics of the advertisement from the identified ad request. In various embodiments, the online system 140 determines scores for each identified ad request. A score for an identified is based on a bid amount included in the ad request, a likelihood of the viewing user interacting with the advertisement in the ad request, and the predicted amount of time the user will view the advertisement in the ad request. For example, the online system 140 determines a score for the ad request by combining the bid amount included in the ad request and increasing the score if the predicted amount of time the viewing user will view the advertisement from the ad request is within the specific range. Based on the scores for various identified ad requests, the online system 140 selects 340 an ad request including an advertisement for presentation to the viewing user based on the scores, such as described above in conjunction with FIG. 2. By increasing the scores for ad requests including advertisements the user is predicted to view for times within the specific range, the online system 140 increases a probability of the user being presented with an advertisement that the user will view for an amount of time that causes the user to subsequently recall the advertisement. Alternatively, the online system 140 generates a set of identified ad requests including advertisements predicted to be viewed by the user for amounts of time within the specific range and selects an and increases the score if the predicted amount of time the viewing user will view the advertisement is within the specific range. The online system 140 selects 340 an ad request from the set of ad requests based on their bid amounts. For example, the online system selects 340 an ad request form the set having at least a threshold bid amount or having a maximum bid amount; in another example, the online system 140 ranks ad requests in the set based on their bid amounts and selects 340 an ad request having at least a threshold position in the ranking. Hence, the online system 140 selects 340 an ad request including an advertisement for which a predicted amount of time the viewing user will view the advertisement in the selected ad request is within the specific range of times. In some embodiments, the one or more models associated with the viewing user determine a likelihood of the viewing user viewing a content item for an amount of time within the specific range. The online system 140 may determine scores for identified ad requests based on bid amounts included in the identified ad requests and likelihoods of the viewing user viewing advertisements in the identified ad requests for an amount of time within the specific range. For example, the online system 140 determines a score for an identified ad request as a product of a bid amount included in the identified ad request and a likelihood of the viewing user viewing an advertisement from the identified ad request for an amount of time within the specific range. The online system 140 then selects 340 an identified ad request based on the scores. For example, the online system 140 selects 340 an identified ad request having at least a threshold score. Alternatively, the online system 140 ranks the identified ad requests based on their scores and selects 340 an identified ad request having at least a threshold position in the ranking. The online system 140 presents 345 an advertisement from the selected ad request to the viewing user. For example, the online system 140 includes the advertisement from the selected ad request in a feed of content that is communicated by the online system 140 to a client device 110 associated with the viewing user, which presents the feed of content, including the advertisement, to the viewing user. When the advertisement from the selected ad request is presented to the viewing user, the online system 140 receives information from an application associated with the online system 140 executing on the client device 110 identifying an amount of time the advertisement was viewed by the user, as further described above. Based on the amount of time the viewing user viewed the advertisement, the online system 140 modifies the one or more models associated with the viewing user. Additionally, the online system 140 modifies the specific range of amounts of time for users having at least a threshold number or a threshold percentage of characteristics matching characteristics of the viewing user to view the advertisement from the selected ad request based on the amount of time the viewing user views the advertisement from the selected ad request.

FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a processor including two heterogeneous cores.

FIG. 6 illustrates core switch operations and overhead according to an embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS A heterogeneous computing strategy is to integrate a number of cores, wherein each core is efficient at executing certain code but inefficient at executing certain other code. The runtime software (SW) and hardware (HW) collaboratively partition the input program into code segments suitable for different cores, and execute each of them on the most appropriate core, while putting the other cores in low power state, to achieve high performance with low power and energy consumption. One example of such a system consists of at least one wide-in-order core and at least one narrow out-of-order core, and according to embodiments of the present invention, this heterogeneous system can achieve improved out-of-order core performance while consuming a fraction of energy and power. A major challenge for this type of computing system is to identify program behavior changes quickly and switch to the appropriate core efficiently at runtime. Embodiments of the present invention use runtime software and\/or hardware to automatically switch execution of different code segments in the same program to the most appropriate core, and significantly speed up performance of single threaded programs. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific types of processor cores, specific processor configurations, specific hot code region identification algorithms, specific structures for storing translated\/optimized code, specific division of tasks between hardware\/software, specific processor units\/logic, etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that these specific details need not be employed to practice the present invention. In other instances, well known components or methods, such as specific and alternative processor architecture, specific logic circuits\/code for described algorithms, specific code implementations, specific binary translation details, and other specific operational details of microprocessors haven't been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. In one embodiment, the method and apparatus described herein are for implementing a native core with a software-managed core to achieve maximum performance and power savings. Specifically, the collaboration between cores is discussed primarily in reference to an out-of-order core and an in-order, co-designed core. Yet, the apparatus' and methods described herein are not so limited, as they may be implemented in any distribution of code between heterogeneous cores. For example, the code distribution methods and apparatus' described herein may be utilized with two out-of-order cores that implement unique Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). Furthermore, the collaboration between such cores is often discussed as split between hardware mechanisms and code\/software. However, any blend or exclusive use of hardware, software, and\/or firmware may be utilized to implement the methods and apparatus' described below. Referring to FIG. 1, an embodiment of a processor including multiple cores is illustrated. Processor 100 includes any processor, such as a microprocessor, an embedded processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), a network processor, or other device to execute code. Processor 100, in one embodiment, includes at least two cores\u2014core 101 and 102\u2014of different types. However, processor 100 may include any number of processing elements. In one embodiment, a processing element refers to a thread unit, a thread slot, a process unit, a context, a logical processor, a hardware thread, a core, and\/or any other element, which is capable of holding a state for a processor, such as an execution state or architectural state. In other words, a processing element, in one embodiment, refers to any hardware capable of being independently associated with code, such as a software thread, operating system, application, or other code. A physical processor typically refers to an integrated circuit, which potentially includes any number of other processing elements, such as cores or hardware threads. A core often refers to logic located on an integrated circuit capable of maintaining an independent architectural state wherein each independently maintained architectural state is associated with at least some dedicated execution resources. In contrast to cores, a hardware thread typically refers to any logic located on an integrated circuit capable of maintaining an independent architectural state wherein the independently maintained architectural states share access to execution resources. As can be seen, when certain resources are shared and others are dedicated to an architectural state, the line between the nomenclature of a hardware thread and core overlaps. Yet often, a core and a hardware thread are viewed by an operating system as individual logical processors, where the operating system is able to individually schedule operations on each logical processor. Physical processor 100, as illustrated in FIG. 1, includes two cores, core 101 and 102. Here, core 101 and 102 are considered heterogeneous cores, i.e. cores with different configurations, functional units, and\/or logic. In one embodiment, core 101 includes an out-of-order processor core, while core 102 includes an in-order processor core. However, cores 101 and 102 may be individually selected from any type of core. Yet to further the discussion, the functional units illustrated in FIG. 1 are described in further detail below. As depicted, core 101 includes two hardware threads 101a and 101b, which may also be referred to as hardware thread slots 101a and 101b. In contrast, core 102 includes one hardware thread 102a. Therefore, software entities, such as an operating system, in one embodiment potentially view processor 100 as three separate processors, i.e. three logical processors or processing elements capable of executing three software threads concurrently. Alternatively, a software entity may only view processor 100 as having two separate processors\u2014thread slots 101a and 101b\u2014while the described code distribution mechanisms manage execution of code on core 102. A first thread is associated with architecture state registers 101a, a second thread is associated with architecture state registers 101b, and a third thread may be associated with architecture state registers 102a. As illustrated, architecture state registers 101a are replicated in architecture state registers 101b, so individual architecture states\/contexts are capable of being stored for logical processor 101a and logical processor 101b. Architecture state registers 102a may be the same as registers 101a, 101b. Or registers 102a may instead be unique to the architecture of core 102. In core 101, other smaller resources, such as instruction pointers and renaming logic in rename allocator logic 130 may also be replicated for threads 101a and 101b. Some resources, such as re-order buffers in reorder\/retirement unit 135, instruction-translation buffer (ITLB) 120, load\/store buffers, and queues may be shared through partitioning. Other resources, such as general purpose internal registers, page-table base register, low-level data-cache and data-TLB 150, execution unit(s) 140, and portions of out-of-order unit 135 are potentially fully shared. Processor 100 often includes other resources, which may be fully shared, shared through partitioning, or dedicated by\/to processing elements. In FIG. 1, an embodiment of a purely exemplary processor with illustrative logical units\/resources of a processor is illustrated. Note that a processor may include, or omit, any of these functional units, as well as include any other known functional units, logic, or firmware not depicted. As illustrated, core 101 is illustrated as a simplified out-of-order (OOO) processor core. The OOO core includes a branch target buffer (BTB) 120 to predict branches to be executed\/taken and an instruction-translation buffer (I-TLB) 120 to store address translation entries for instructions. Core 101 further includes decode module 125 coupled to fetch unit 120 to decode fetched elements. Fetch logic, in one embodiment, includes individual sequencers associated with thread slots 101a, 101b, respectively. Usually core 101 is associated with a first Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), which defines\/specifies instructions executable on processor 100. Here, often machine code instructions that are part of the first ISA include a portion of the instruction (referred to as an opcode), which references\/specifies an instruction or operation to be performed. Decode logic 125 includes circuitry that recognizes these instructions from their opcodes and passes the decoded instructions on in the pipeline for processing as defined by the first ISA. In one example, allocator and renamer block 130 includes an allocator to reserve resources, such as register files to store instruction processing results. However, threads 101a and 101b are potentially capable of out-of-order execution, where allocator and renamer block 130 also reserves other resources, such as reorder buffers to track instruction status. Unit 130 may also include a register renamer to rename program\/instruction reference registers to other registers internal to processor 100. Reorder\/retirement unit 135 includes components, such as the reorder buffers mentioned above, load buffers, and store buffers, to support out-of-order execution and later in-order retirement of instructions executed out-of-order. Scheduler and execution unit(s) block 140, in one embodiment, includes a scheduler unit to schedule instructions\/operation on execution units. For example, a floating point instruction is scheduled on a port of an execution unit that has an available floating point execution unit. Register files associated with the execution units are also included to store information instruction processing results. Exemplary execution units include a floating point execution unit, an integer execution unit, a jump execution unit, a load execution unit, a store execution unit, and other known execution units. Lower level data cache and data address translation lookup\/side buffer (D-TLB) 150 are coupled to execution unit(s) 140. The data cache is to store recently used\/operated on elements, such as data operands, which are potentially held in memory coherency states. The D-TLB is to store recent virtual\/linear to physical address translations. As a specific example, a processor may include a page table structure to break physical memory into a plurality of virtual pages. As stated above, in one embodiment, core 102 includes an in-order, co-designed core. As a result, FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified pipeline of an in-order core. This pipeline includes fetch unit 121, decode unit 126, execution unit(s) 141, and a lower-level data cache 151. These units may work in a similar manner to the corresponding units in core 101. Yet, in an in-order core, the instructions\/operations are executed in program order, instead of potential out-of-order execution as in core 101. In one example, out-of-order core 101 is referred to as the native core, while the in-order core 102 is referred to as a co-designed core. Alternatively, in-order core 102 is the native core and out-of-order core 101 is the co-designed core. Here, cores 101 and 102 share access to higher-level or further-out cache 110, which is to cache recently fetched elements. Note that higher-level or further-out refers to cache levels increasing or getting further way from the execution unit(s). In one embodiment, higher-level cache 110 is a last-level data cache\u2014last cache in the memory hierarchy on processor 100\u2014such as a second or third level data cache. However, higher level cache 110 is not so limited, as it may be associated with or include an instruction cache. A trace cache\u2014a type of instruction cache\u2014instead may be coupled after decoder 125 to store recently decoded traces. In the depicted configuration, processor 100 also includes link interface module 105 to communicate with devices external to processor 100, such as system memory 175, a chipset, a northbridge, or other integrated circuit (including single integrated circuit implementations such as a \u201csystem on a chip\u201d (SOC)). Memory 175 may be dedicated to processor 100 or shared with other devices in a system. Common examples of types of memory 175 include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static RAM (SRAM), non-volatile memory (NV memory), and other known storage devices. In one embodiment, code is distributed between core 101 and 102 based on maximizing performance and power. For example, code regions are identified to perform better on one of the two cores 101, 102. As a result, when one of such code regions is encountered\/detected, that code section is distributed to the appropriate core. Identification of such regions may be done statically (before execution of the code, such as through program profile analysis) or dynamically (during execution of the code) by hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In one illustrative example of a dynamic approach, one processor core, such as core 101, may be selected as a default core to execute code based on its performance, power-savings, native ISA, any other known processing consideration, or a combination thereof. Then, regions of the default code that execute poorly on core 101, or would execute better on core 102, are identified. Upon subsequently encountering those identified code sections, they are distributed to core 102 for execution. Note that execution of those regions on core 102 may include speculative, run-ahead execution to warm-up core 101, serial execution of those regions on core 102 with execution of other regions on core 101 that depend on results from those regions, or parallel, concurrent execution of those regions with execution of other code on core 102. In an example of a static approach, a compiler or user may identify sections of code, such as with instructions or demarcations, which execute better on one core or the other. Here, core 101 executes code until such an instruction is encountered. Either in response to monitoring from core 102 or by sole initiative (triggering) of core 102, the identified code section is then executed on core 102 based on the encountered instruction. Whether identification of code sections to run better on one core or another is done dynamically or statically, in some embodiments, native code is translated and\/or optimized to be run on another core. For example, assume core 101 includes decode logic 125 that recognizes a first ISA type, and core 102 includes decode logic 126 that recognizes a second ISA type. In this case, if a code region of the first ISA type is to be executed on core 102, then the code region is translated to the second ISA type to be executed on core 102. Note that translation between ISA types is purely illustrative. Instead, out-of-order optimized code to be executed on core 101 may be re-optimized for execution of in-order core 102. In this scenario, core 102 may include the same, or a subset of, the same ISA as core 101. Yet, optimizations are performed on the code to ensure it runs more efficiently on a simple, wide in-order core. The collaboration between core 101 and core 102 to distribute code efficiently may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. The example above regarding a dynamic approach to identifying code regions is further examined to illustrate exemplary embodiments of collaboration mechanisms. In the example, program code, in a native format, is optimized to execute on out-of-order core 101. During execution of a code region or the program code, monitor hardware associated with core 101 and\/or core 102 may be utilized to determine the performance associated with core 101's execution of the code region. Alternatively, code, such as software, OS code, micro-code, or other code, may be executed on core 102, to determine\/monitor the performance of core 101 in executing the code region. If it's determined that the code region would be better executed on core 102, then hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof may be utilized to translate and\/or optimize the code region to be executed on core 102. As a result, when core 101 encounters the code region again\u2014an instruction pointer references the code region, an identifier instruction to identify the code region is fetched or decoded, or another way of identifying a code region is detected\u2014then the translated\/optimized version of the code region is executed on core 102. In one embodiment, during execution of the code region on core 102, core 101 may concurrently execute other code regions to increase overall program execution performance Note that concurrent or parallel execution may include execution of separate software threads on cores 101, 102 as well. In contrast, threads may be pipelined on cores 101, 102. As an example of this scenario, assume each of the two software threads includes multiple stages of code (hot, cold, etc). Here, cold code from a first thread may be executed on core 101, and when a hot region is encountered, a translated hot region is executed on core 102. During execution of the translated hot region of code on core 102, cold code from the second thread may be executed on core 101. On core 102, when execution of the first translated hot code completes, execution of another hot region from the second software thread may then be started. As can be seen from this example, the stages of code may be interleaved on each core resulting in a pipelined type of execution. In another embodiment, code may be executed sequentially with respect to the two cores, such as a code region on core 101, the identified code region on core 102, and then subsequently another code region on core 101. In addition, even when a code region is initially identified for execution on core 102, the performance of that execution may also be monitored. The performance on both cores may then be taken into account in determining which core is best suited to execute the code region to achieve maximum performance and power savings. For example, if a code region is identified to be executed as translated code on core 102, but the performance on core 102 is below the performance on core 101 (or the performance gain on core 102 doesn't outweigh the power savings of execution on core 201), then the code may be re-distributed to core 101 upon subsequent encounters. FIG. 1 illustrates an abstracted, logical view of an exemplary processor with a representation of different modules, units, and\/or logic. However, note that a processor utilizing the methods and apparatus' described herein need not include the illustrated units. And, the processor may omit some or all of the units shown. Furthermore, a majority of the discussion above has been in reference to an out-of-order processor core and an in-order processor core. However, as aforementioned, the two processor cores may be any version of heterogeneous cores, such as a native core and a software managed core. In addition, FIG. 1 only depicts two cores; yet, a processor may include any number of cores, such as multiple cores of the same type, as well as more than two cores that each differ in type. FIG. 1 also illustrates an embodiment of processor that is coupled in a point-to-point fashion with an interface to an external memory controller (controller hub 170). However, many current processors have begun including an on-processor memory interface module\u2014an on-chip module\u2014with a ring configuration to interconnect multiple cores, as well as shared caches and other interfaces. Although not illustrated, processor 100, in one embodiment, includes a ring interconnect coupling core, cache, and memory controller components. Here, caching agents are utilized to manage a slice of a physically distributed cache. As an example, each cache component is to manage a slice of a cache for a collocated core\u2014a core the cache agent is associated with for purpose of managing the distributed slice of the cache. Much like cache agents handle traffic on a ring interconnect and interface with cache slices, core agents\/components are to handle traffic and interface with cores. Additionally, the ring interconnect may couple Memory Controller Interface Logic (MCIL) and\/or other controllers to interface with other modules, such memory and\/or a graphics processor. Referring to FIG. 2 an embodiment of a code distribution module to distribute code among two cores is illustrated. In one embodiment, cores 201, 202 are heterogeneous cores. For example, core 201 is an out-of-order (OOO) core adapted to execute code out of original program order, and core 202 is an in-order (or serial core) adapted to execute code in program order. A non-exhaustive exemplary list of other core types include: a native core, a non-native core, a software managed core, a native ISA core, a translated ISA core, a co-designed core, a speculative execution core, and a non-speculative execution core. In one embodiment, code distribution module 210 is to distribute code between core 201 and 202 based on maximizing performance and power savings. A module as used herein may refer to hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Additionally, a module, unit, or logic may be centralized in a core or processor, as well as distributed throughout. For example, code distribution module 210 may include distribution code, such as micro-code or software, held in storage associated with core 201, core 202, processor 200, or a system including processor 200. Here, the distribution code, when executed, is to perform the code distribution. In contrast, the code distribution process may be managed by hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, code distribution module 210 is to dynamically switch execution of program code from one core to another. Dynamically switching program code is discussed in more detail below in reference to FIG. 4 and FIG. 5. However, as an illustrative example for this section of discussion, program code may include any code to be executed with a processing element, such as binary or machine code. A hot portion of code may refer to a portion of code that is better suited to execute on one core over the other based on considerations, such as power, performance, heat, other known processor metric(s), or a combination thereof. Here, assuming core 201 is a default core for native execution of the program code, then identification of a hot portion of the program code includes determining a portion of code that is better suited to be executed on core 202. In the embodiment where core 201 is an OOO core and core 202 is an in-order core, then a hot portion of code may refer to a hot spot of the program code that is better suited to be executed on serial core 202, which potentially has more available resources for execution of a highly-recurrent section. As an example, a hot portion of code is identified by a recurrence pattern of the portion of code, or some other known metric, such as instruction count or cycle count. Often a section of code with a high-recurrence and predictable latency pattern may be optimized to be executed more efficiently on an in-order core. Essentially, in this example, cold code (low-recurrence) is distributed to native, OOO core 101, while hot code (high-recurrence) is distributed to software-managed, in-order core 102. A hot portion of code may be identified statically, dynamically, or a combination thereof. In the first case, a compiler or user may determine a section of program code is hot code. Here, a hot code identifier instruction(s) may demarcate a section of code as hot, i.e. to be executed on core 202 instead of on core 101. Decode logic in core 201, in one embodiment, is adapted to decode a hot code identifier instruction from the program code, which is to identify the hot portion of the program code. The fetch or decode of such an instruction may trigger translation and\/or execution of the hot section of code on core 202. In this example, the code distribution module 210 includes the decode logic to detect the hot code detection instruction. And module 210 may also include other hardware and\/or software to carry out the translation\/optimization, as well as the execution of the hot code on core 202. Alternatively, the hot-code section may be pre-optimized\/translated for execution on core 202. In another example, code distribution module 210 dynamically (during execution) identifies hot spots\/regions in program code. In one embodiment, hardware included in core 201 and\/or core 202 is utilized to profile execution of the program code on a core, such as core 201. Based on the characteristics of the profile\u2014power and\/or performance metrics associated with execution\u2014a region of the program code may be identified as hot code. Similar to the operation of hardware, monitoring code may be executed on one core, such as core 202, to perform the monitoring\/profiling of program code being executed on the other core, such as core 201. Note that such monitoring code may be code held in storage structures within the cores, within processor 200, or held in a system including processor 200. For example, the monitoring code may be microcode, or other code, held in storage structures of core 201, core 202, or processor 200. And, the monitoring code may be executed by traditional execution units, as well as other firmware or logic on processor 200. As yet another example, a static identification of hot code is made as a hint. But dynamic profiling of the program code execution is able to ignore the static identification of a region of code as hot; this type of static identification is often referred to as a compiler or user hint that dynamic profiling may take into account in determining which core is appropriate for code distribution. Moreover, as is the nature of dynamic profiling, identification of a region of code as hot doesn't restrict that section of code to always being identified as hot. For example, assume program code is being executed on an out-of-order core 201. Monitor code executing on core 202 monitors the performance level of core 201's execution of a section of the program code. Based on the implementation, if the performance on core 201 is determined to be enough lower than it would perform on core 202 and\/or a recurrence pattern of the code section on core 201 is high-enough to be predicted to hide core transition overhead; then the code section is identified as hot. After translation and\/or optimization, a translated version of the code section is executed on core 202. Similar to the monitoring of execution on core 201, the execution of the translated version of code may be monitored on core 202, such as through execution of the performance monitoring code. If the performance is lower on core 202 than on core 201, then the identification of the code section as hot may be dynamically reversed (the section of hot code may be relabeled as cold code). Once a section, spot, or region of codes is identified as hot, code distribution module 210, in one embodiment, optimizes and\/or translates the hot section of code to obtain optimized\/translated hot code. In one embodiment, translation and\/or optimization code, such as binary translation code, is held in storage logic of core 202. As an example, the binary translation code may be part of micro-code held in core 202. The translation\/optimization code, when executed, translates\/optimizes the code section for execution on core 202. In one embodiment, core 201, 202 may recognize the same ISA, or a subset thereof, where translation\/optimization is merely translating\/optimizing code to execute more efficiently on core 202. In another embodiment, core 201, 202 recognize different ISAs, where translation includes translating the code region from one ISA recognizable by core 201 to another ISA recognizable by core 202. Although translation\/optimization is discussed in reference to execution of translation\/optimization code, any known mechanism for translating\/optimizing code, even through exclusive hardware, may be utilized. In one embodiment, upon encountering an identified section of hot code with core 201, the hot code (a translated version thereof) is executed on core 202. Any known trigger for determining when a hot code region is encountered may be utilized. A few high-level examples include: encountering\/referencing an instruction address associated with the code region, fetching\/decoding\/scheduling\/executing an instruction identifying a code section as hot code, fetching\/decoding\/scheduling\/executing an instruction indicating a translated version of hot code is to be executed on another core, an external trigger from a monitor indicating a hot code region has been encountered, etc. As an illustrative example, code distribution module 210 includes a monitor module implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. When the monitor module identifies a hot region of code or translates the hot region to a translated region, the monitor module registers an instruction address associated with the hot region of code. This registration may include association of the instruction address with a location of the translated region of code. Then, when an instruction pointer (program counter) subsequently references the instruction address, its determined from the registered instruction address that a hot region of code has been encountered. Note that any form of detection may be used here, such as a synchronous or asynchronous interrupt style of handling the encounter event. Additionally, hardware, micro-code, and\/or firmware may be capable of directly handling the encounter of a hot code section without interrupt-like handling, i.e. the trigger event is not serviced by a handler. Note that core 101 and 102 may share certain hardware structures, such as a mapping structure, to identify addresses that are registered as hot code. In response to encountering a hot code section on core 201, a translated and\/or optimized version of the hot code section is executed on core 202. Despite how the hot code section is identified and encountered on core 201, any known method for enabling execution of code on another core may be utilized. In one embodiment, a collaboration module is utilized to enable such execution. For example, cores 201, 202 may share certain hardware structures and\/or include communication channels to share information. As one example, cores 101, 102 may share a data cache, so when execution is migrated from core 201 to 202, the data isn't physically moved, but rather is already resident in the shared cache. Similarly, a register file, such as a shadow register file, in one embodiment, is shared between cores 201 and 202, so register states (context) doesn't have to be migrated from one core to another. As an alternative, instead of sharing a register file, a high-speed interconnect may be used to physically migrate context, or a portion thereof, from one core to another. Additionally, with infrequent transfers software may be utilized to perform such transfers. As one example, input values into a hot code-section are transferred from core 201 to core 202 to support execution of the hot-code section on core 202. After execution, output values are then transferred back to core 201. In one embodiment, only identified input\/output values from code sections are transferred, i.e. a partial context switch. Note that such input values may be identified by the user (software\/compiler) and\/or by hardware\/firmware algorithms. Here, direct access hardware may be adapted to read input values from registers, buffers, or other structures in core 201 and write them to core 202. Inversely, the same or different hardware may be utilized to read values from core 202 and write them to core 201. However, where identifying such values becomes too cumbersome, an entire context switch, replication, or sharing may be performed to provide values between cores 201 and 202. Referring next to FIG. 3, an embodiment of a processor for distributing code among cores to achieve maximum performance and power savings is depicted. As above, processor 300 includes two processor cores; each of which is of a different core type. As one example, core 301 is a native, out-of-order (OOO) processor core, while core 302 is a software managed, in-order processor core. Core 301 and 302 may, but are not required to, recognize different ISA types. In fact, core 302 may recognize a subset of core 301's ISA. Or, core 302 may include a separate ISA that partially overlaps core 301's ISA. As described above, a core or processor is often associated with an ISA\u2014a definition of recognized instruction\u2014by decode hardware\/software in the core or processor. In one embodiment, monitor module 305 is to monitor execution of native program code 325 on native, OOO core 301; through this monitoring, module 305 is to identify a hot portion\/region 327 of the program code 325. Monitor module may be comprised of hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, monitor module 305 includes hardware to monitor execution. As one example, the hardware includes micro-architectural and\/or architectural hooks, such as retirement pushout tags\/counters to measure retirement pushouts, instruction counters to count numbers of instructions, overall trace execution measurement logic to measure overall execution length and\/or time, recurrence counters to count a number of times a code section was executed, etc., to determine performance\/power metrics during execution of code 325. This type of hardware may be located in any portion of an integrated circuit\/processor, such as within out-of-order core 301, within in-order core 302, and in a non-associated portion of the integrated circuit that is not included within either OOO processor core 301 or the in-order processor core 302. In another embodiment, monitor module 305 includes software, such as monitor code, which when executed, is to monitor execution of program code 325 and to identify a hot region 327 of the program code 325. As an illustrative example, processor 300 includes storage structures, such as Read Only Memory (ROM) structures, programmable logic, etc, to hold code, microcode, or machine code, when executed, causes the monitoring to occur. However, monitor code may be stored in any machine readable medium associated with cores 301, 302. Note that use of the term execution is not only limited to execution by traditional execution units, but instead may refer to execution by other hardware or programmable logic associated with processor 300, such as execution of microcode with firmware. Here, the executed monitor code may perform the same monitoring of recurrence, power, and performance metric that is measurable by hardware. As one example, the monitoring hardware and\/or code tracks\/determines recurrence patterns for code sections of the program code. As a simple example, a data structure associates a reference to a code section (code region 327), such as an instruction address, with a count of the number of times the instruction address\/code section has been executed on core 301. Note that the count may be associated with an absolute count (total count) or a temporal count (a count over an amount of time). In one embodiment, monitor module 305 is adapted to identify\/detect a hot portion 327 of program code 325. Monitor module 305, in one example, is to measure one or more performance metric(s) for the hot portion 327 of the program code 325 during execution on OOO processor core 301. And module 305 is to identify the hot portion 327 of program code 325 in response to the performance metric(s) on the OOO processor core being below a threshold. A non-exhaustive, illustrative list of examples of performance metrics include: instruction retirement pushout, a number of instructions executed, an amount of time to execute a code region, a number of times a code regions is encountered\/executed, an amount of power consumed during execution of a code region, an amount of time spent in different power states during execution of a code region, a thermal density during execution of a code segment, etc. Using one of the examples above, assume OOO core 301 is executing program code 325. Monitor code is being executed to determine a number of times regions of program code 325 are executed on core 301. When that count meets or exceeds a threshold, in one embodiment, monitor module 305 identifies\/determines that region 327 is hot code. If a threshold value of three is used, then when monitor code executing on core 302 detects hot region 327 being re-executed a third time on core 301, region 327 is identified as a hot region of code. The specific example of determining a recurrence pattern may be extrapolated to see that a similar process\u2014count, compare against a threshold, and identify\u2014may be employed for any measured performance metric. Furthermore, determining a performance metric is not limited to simple counts, but may include any known algorithm for determining execution or power savings performance in a core, processor, or computer system. However, identifying hot region 327 within program code 325 is not limited to dynamic performance monitoring. Instead, compiler or static program analysis may be utilized to determine code sections that are likely to be better suited for execution on in-order core 302. For example, assume program analysis reveals that hot region 327 is likely to be re-executed a number of times. In response to this discovery, a compiler or user may insert instructions or demarcations identifying a section of code as hot code. Therefore, when decoders of core 301 encounter such instructions, they recognize that region 327 is hot code that is to be executed on core 302. Note that in some embodiments, users may identify such regions of code based on their knowledge of a program without in-depth program analysis. In one embodiment, in response to identifying region 327 as hot, code 327 is optimized or translated by optimization\/translation module 310 to obtain optimized hot code 304. Similar to operation of monitor module 305, optimization module 310 may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. For example, translation and\/or optimization code may be stored in structures associated with core 302, core 301, or processor 300. To illustrate, binary translation code is stored in firmware associated with core 302. And the binary translation code is executed to translate hot region 327 from a native format for core 301 to a format for core 302. Note that translation may be between ISAs or other formats, while optimization may include any known method for optimizing code for execution, such as known techniques for optimizing code from parallel execution on OOO core 301 to serial execution on core 302, as well as the inverse. However, use of binary translation code in firmware is purely illustrative, as any translation code or optimization code may be held anywhere in a computer system, such as microcode in core 302 or regular program code in a system memory. And, the optimization code may be executed in any manner to translate or optimize hot region 327 to obtain optimized hot code 304. In fact, any known methods or apparatus' for translating or optimizing code for a core, such as the methods and apparatus' known for translating code in current software managed processors may be used. Whether software, firmware, hardware, or a combination is to be used, translation may be performed statically or dynamically. In fact, much like monitoring may be done dynamically during runtime or statically before execution, translation and optimization may similarly be performed. In the example where a compiler or user identifies hot region 327, the optimization and translation may take place at that point (before execution). Here, a hot code identifier instruction may be utilized to both identify hot code region 327 and specify the location of the optimized\/translated code 304. However, no matter if section 327 is identified as hot code before or during execution, the optimization and translation, in some embodiments, takes place dynamically (during runtime). In one embodiment, hot region 327 is optimized\/translated in parallel with other execution. In one example, core 302 begins executing optimization code in parallel with core 301's execution of region 327. Here, monitor module 305 detects execution of hot code region 327 on core 301, so optimization is initiated on core 302. While further instructions from hot region 327 are still being executed on core 301, core 302 begins optimization. As a result, core 302 is essentially optimizing hot code 327 in parallel with execution of hot code 327 on core 301. In another example, core 301 executes other sections of program code 325 or other mutually exclusive code in parallel to core 302's optimization of hot code 327. In another embodiment, optimization of hot region 327 is done serially. For example, core 301 executes hot region 327, and then subsequently core 301 or 302 optimizes hot code region 327. In one embodiment, code 327 is stored at its original memory location and translated on the fly by core 302. However, in most cases, its more efficient to translate\/optimize an entire code section before execution. As a result, after optimization\/translation module 310 optimizes code for a core, such as core 302, the optimized hot code 304 is stored elsewhere. The other location for optimized hot code 304 may be another location in memory, such as a home, system memory location. Yet, since hot code 327 is often associated with frequent execution, its potentially advantageous to hold optimized version 304 closer to core 302. Therefore, in the illustrated embodiment, core 303 includes a code cache 303 to hold the optimized hot code 304. Note that code cache 303 may be a separate cache structure in core 302; a shared cache structure, such as a shared instruction or data cache in core 302; or other general storage structure associated with core 302. Referring back to the discussion of monitor module 305, one embodiment of encountering hot code region 327 includes a program counter referencing an instruction address associated with a code section. As depicted, mapping module 315 is to hold a code region reference, such as the instruction address, associated with optimized hot code reference 317. Essentially, an entry of mapping module 315 associates hot code region 327 with an optimized version thereof (optimized hot code 304). As an illustrative example, reference 316 includes an address, such as the instruction address, associated with hot region 327. In this scenario, when core 301 encounters (a program counter points to) the instruction address held in field 316 of mapping module 315, then monitor module 305 indicates that hot region 327 has been encountered and is to be executed on core 302. Collaboration module 320, which is briefly described above and discussed in more detail below, then facilitates the movement of data and\/or context to core 302 for execution. Determining hot region 327 has been encountered and is to be executed on core 302, in the above example, is only on reference 316. The association of field 317 with field 316 may then be utilized to quickly determine where optimized hot code version 304 of region 327 is located. As a result, field 317 may include any reference to the location of optimized hot code 304. A few simple examples of such a reference include: an address of an entry in code cache 303 holding optimized code 304, an offset from the start of code cache 303 to entry 304 holding optimized hot code, and a physical or linear address associated with entry 304. Mapping module 315 is illustrated in a simple table structure, which may be implemented and\/or maintained in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Yet, any known method for associating one location with another location may be utilized for associating hot code 327 with an optimized version thereof. Although not specifically illustrated, portions of monitor module 305 in combination with mapping module 315 may form a trigger module for indicating optimized hot code 304 is to be executed on core 302, instead of native code 327 on core 301. As an example, when a program counter for core 301 is moved to a next instruction address, trigger hardware checks that address against references stored in mapping hardware table 315. Here, assume the program counter points the instruction address that references code region 327 held in field 316. Then, the trigger hardware, based on the entry in mapping table 315, indicates that an optimized code region 304 for code region 327 exists. As a result, execution of code region 327 on core 301 may be elided, since an optimized version already exists and is to be executed on core 302. In one embodiment, core 301 halts execution (stops or transitions into a low power state) until core 302 completes execution of the optimized code. However, this may not take full advantage of the processing capacity of processor 300. Therefore, in another embodiment, core 301 interleaves execution of another software thread (code other than program code 325), while optimized hot code 304 is executing on core 302. As yet another example, core 301 may execute other portions of program code 325 speculatively, which essentially performs a run-ahead helper thread of execution, or executes other portions of code 325 that don't depend from code region 327 out-of-order. Collaboration module 320, in one embodiment, provides collaboration functionality between cores 301, 302. As the simplest example, collaboration module 320 includes an interconnect between cores 301, 302 to transfer information. Yet, in another embodiment collaboration module includes other hardware, which may be exclusive to individual cores or shared between, to facilitate the aforementioned collaboration. For example, core 302 may share a shadow register file of core 301, such that a full context switch of register state from core 301 to core 302 does not have to be performed when optimized hot code 304 is executed on core 302. Instead, core 302 is able to directly access the shadow register file in that scenario. However, collaboration module is not only limited to shared structures and\/or an interconnect. In fact, collaboration module 320 may include hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof to provide direct read and\/or write access to registers, storage structures, and buffers in both cores 301, 302. As a result, collaboration module 320, in one embodiment, is capable of transferring data\/register values needed for execution of optimized hot code from core 301 to core 302. And, it is also capable of transferring results back from core 302 to core 301 to enable subsequent proper execution on core 301. Although monitor module 305 has primarily been discussed in reference to monitoring execution on native core 301, monitor module 305, in one embodiment, is also to monitor execution of optimized code on core 302. As a result, monitor module 305 is capable of comparing performance of code section 327 on core 301 with performance of an optimized version 304 on core 302. Furthermore, when performance on core 302 is lower than performance on core 301, or the performance gain is small on core 302 in comparison to an increase in power consumption, then the decision to identify region 327 as hot code may be reversed. As an example, the entry of mapping module 315 indicating such a decision is de-allocated or invalidated; such that the next time core 301 encounters hot code 327, monitor module 305 does not detect reference 316 and does not indicate an optimized hot code version of region 327 should be executed on core 302. Essentially, the reversal sends the previously identified region 327 back to out-of-order core 301. As a specific illustrative example to further demonstrate this performance comparison, assume code region 327 is identified as hot code based on a high-recurrence pattern and a high-instruction execution count. As a result, code 327 is optimized by binary translation code resident on core 302 to obtain optimized code 304. When optimized code 304 is stored in code cache 303, an entry in mapping table 315 is created to associate code region 327 with optimized version 304. When core 301 next encounters a reference that matches the reference in field 316, then execution of optimized code 304 is triggered on core 302, instead of executing code region 327 on core 301. Note that collaboration module through transfer, sharing, or context switching provides the proper values from core 301 to core 302. During core 302's execution of optimized hot code 304, the same performance metric\u2014instruction execution count\u2014is tracked by monitor module 305. If the instruction execution count is less than code region 327 was executed on core 301, then the status quo of region 327 being identified as hot code continues in the future. However, if the instruction execution count is longer on core 302 or a significant power increase is detected, then the identification of region 327 as hot code may be reversed, as described above. In addition to providing communication between cores 301 and 302, collaboration module 320 may also include other features to manage multiple cores of different types. As a first example, a power manager implements a power algorithm to ensure both core 301 and 302 don't operation at maximum power at the same time. However, this example is purely illustrative. And other power algorithms may allow such maximum operation. As another power consideration, core 302 may reside in a power state below maximum (a low-power state) during monitoring of execution on core 301. For example, when core 301 is associated with mechanisms to perform its own monitoring, then core 302 doesn't need to be fully powered up until there is an optimized version of code to be executed. As a result, power is potentially saved by turning off core 302 until it's needed for execution. Inversely, core 301 may be powered down (put in a power state below maximum, such as an ACPI low power state or sleep state), while core 302 is executing optimized hot code. Dynamically switching execution from core to core involves two challenges: 1) timely and accurately predict the most appropriate core for a given segment of code, and 2) efficiently migrate execution between cores. In one embodiment, program execution on a first core may be identified by runtime software and\/or hardware (e.g. based on analyzed ILP in the code region), and then performance metrics and\/or statistics of the current core may be continuously collected by Monitor Module 305 to predict when the execution of program code should switch to a second core. This approach is highlighted in FIG. 4. Since this approach uses data from a single core to predict the other core's performance, in one embodiment the approach is called a \u201csingle-core-prediction\u201d algorithm. Turning to FIG. 4, an embodiment of a flow diagram for a method 400 of distributing code among a first core of a first type (such as an out-of-order core) and a second core of a second type (such as an in-order core) to achieve maximum performance and power savings is illustrated. Although the flows of FIG. 4 are illustrated in a substantially serial fashion, the flows may be performed in a different order, as well as in parallel. Furthermore, each of the flows may be performed utilizing hardware, firmware, or through execution of program code. Execution of program code on an out-of-order (OOO) processor core in a processor is monitored. Reference to program code, in one embodiment, refers to (1) execution of a compiler program(s), either dynamically or statically, to compile other program code; (2) execution of a main program, such as an operating system, hypervisor, application code, or other software program; (3) execution of other program code, such as libraries, associated with the main program code, (4) execution of other program code, such as helper threads or other tasks, which may not be directly associated with main program; or (5) a combination thereof. A compiler often includes a program or set of programs to translate source text\/code into target text\/code. Usually, compilation of program\/application code with a compiler is done in multiple phases and passes to transform hi-level programming language code into low-level machine or assembly language code. Yet, single pass compilers may still be utilized for simple compilation. A compiler may utilize any known compilation techniques and perform any known compiler operations, such as lexical analysis, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, code transformation, and code optimization. Larger compilers often include multiple phases, but most often these phases are included within two general phases: (1) a front-end, i.e., generally where syntactic processing, semantic processing, and some transformation\/optimization may take place, and (2) a back-end, i.e., generally where analysis, transformations, optimizations, and code generation takes place. Some compilers refer to a middle end, which illustrates the blurring of delineation between a front-end and back end of a compiler. As a result, reference to insertion, association, generation, or other operation of a compiler may take place in any of the aforementioned phases or passes, as well as any other known phases or passes of a compiler. In one embodiment, monitoring execution of program code by monitor module 305 comprises tracking a number of times code segments\/regions within the program code are executed. Code regions may be determined in any known manner of grouping instructions\/code. As an example, each time an instruction address associated with a code section is referenced by a program counter of the OOO core, a recurrence count is incremented. If the recurrence count for the code section exceeds a threshold, in one embodiment, the code section is identified as hot code. Either in conjunction with determining recurrence patterns or separately, monitoring execution of program code may include determining\/tracking a performance metric associated with code sections. As disclosed above, exemplary performance metrics may include: instruction retirement pushout, a number of instructions executed, an amount of time to execute a code region, a number of times a code regions is encountered\/executed, an amount of power consumed during execution of a code region, an amount of time spent in different power states during execution of a code region, and a thermal density during execution of a code segment. Yet, any known metric, or combination of metrics, associated with processor execution may be monitored during execution of the program code. At block 402, program code may be executed on a first core. In an embodiment, the first core may be of a first type, such as a narrow out-of-order core. At block 404, performance of the first core may be monitored as the first core executes the program code. At block 406, statistics on the performance may be collected. In an embodiment, the statistics may include branch miss rate, cache miss rate, etc. In an embodiment, monitoring performance and collecting statistics may be performed by Monitor Module 305. At block 408, the performance of executing the program code on a second core may be predicted based at least in part on the performance and statistics of executing the program code on the first core. In an embodiment, the second code may be of a second type, such as a wide in-order core. Alternatively, the first type may be a wide in-order core and the second type may be a narrow out-of-order core. In an embodiment, the prediction may be implemented as a function called \u201cpredict_performance\u201d At block 410, if the predicted performance of the second core to execute the program code is better than the monitored performance of the first core executing the program code, then the following actions may be performed. At block 412, the second core may be powered up from a low power or \u201csleep\u201d state. During the power up, the first core continues execution of the program. At block 414, execution of the program code may be switched from the first core to the second core. At block 416, the first core may be powered down to a sleep state. If the predicted performance of the second core is not better than the first core, execution of the program code on the first core may continue. In a subsequent iteration of the method, positions of the first core and the second core in the method may be swapped (e.g., so that the second core is executed first, performance of the second core is monitored, statistics about the second core are collected, performance of the first core is predicted, and so on). In an embodiment, blocks 404 through 416 may be performed by Code Distribution Module 210. The function predict_performance (core number, performance_core1, statistics_core1) uses the current core execution performance and statistics, performance_core1 and statistics_core1, to predict the performance of the execution on the second core. If the predicted performance is higher than that on the current core, the execution is switched to the other core. This approach is based on the assumption that it is possible to predict the other core's performance using the current core's performance information. Intuitively, a program execution with excessive cache\/branch misses should perform better on the narrow out-of-order core due to its ability to hide the miss latency by executing the later instructions out-of-order. On the other hand, a program with high instruction level parallelism (ILP) and low cache\/branch misses should run more efficiently on the wide-in-order core due to its high execution bandwidth. In an embodiment, to define the function predict_performance, one may first run n pieces of code, c1, . . . , cn, on both the first core and the second core and collect their respective performance information (p11, p12, . . . , p1n), (p21, p22, . . . , p2n), and statistics (s11, s12, . . . , s1n), (s21, s22, . . . , s2n), on the two cores respectively. Then one may find the best fit function F such that (F(p11,s11), F(p12,s12), . . . , F(p1n,s1n))-(p21, p22, . . . , p2n) and (F(p21,s21), F(p22,s22), . . . , F(p2n,s2n))-(p11, p12, . . . , p1n) is minimized. If the standard error of the best fit is small, one may use F as the function predict_performance. If the standard error is high, however, one may need to find more performance parameters to enhance the prediction accuracy. One advantage of this single-core-prediction approach is that it uses only the current core execution statistics to predict the performance of the other core, without the performance and power overhead of involving the other core in making the decision. However, this approach assumes that the performance of the two cores is closely correlated. In some environments\/configurations, the performance of the two cores may be only loosely correlated and a good fit function may not exist. Therefore it may be desirable to have a more general approach. In another embodiment, a dual-core-prediction process uses the performance information observed on two cores in a short period to predict the core switch. Specifically, a \u201cprediction\u201d may be performed at regular intervals to sample and compare the performance on the two cores to decide whether or not to switch the execution to a different core. Note that each prediction may involve two core switches: the first switch takes place to get the performance information from the other core, and the second switch may happen when the performance on the other core is not as good as that on the first core so the execution should switch back to the first core. The first core switch involves powering up the other core and warming up its micro-architectural state for execution, and the second switch only involves a core power-down. To reduce core switch overhead, the prediction may be separated into two operations: a \u201cprediction for continuation\u201d (Pcont) operation and a \u201cprediction for switch\u201d (Pswit). The Pcont operation compares the performance information collected on the current core with the previous performance information of the two cores to decide whether or not the execution should continue on the current core. If the Pcont operation predicts that the execution should not continue on the current core, the Pswit operation activates the other core to run the other core for a short time period and compare the performance information on the two cores to decide whether or not the execution should be switched to the other core. To prevent Pcont from continuing execution on the same core for too long, the parameter K is introduced to dictate that the Pswit operation cannot be skipped for more than K times in a row. Also, each time a Pswit operation is skipped, the previous performance is inflated by an Inflation Factor so that the next Pcont period will find it harder to skip the Pswit operation. The dual-core prediction process 500 is shown in FIG. 5. In an embodiment, S is the sampling interval (e.g., number of cycles between predictions), M is the sample length (e.g., in number of cycles) to collect performance on each core, PU is a number of cycles for powering up the second core, IPC is the number of instructions per cycle, K is the maximum number of continuations (K being a natural number), N is the number of continuations (initially set to 0), and Prev_IPC is the previous IPC (which may be initially set to MAX_FLOAT). In an embodiment, S, M, PU, K, and the Inflation Factor may be set to appropriate values. At block 502, program code may be executed on the first core for a sampling interval of S cycles. In an embodiment, the first core may be of a first type, such as a narrow out-of-order core. At block 504, power up of the second core may be signaled PU cycles before the end of S+M cycles from the start of program code execution. In an embodiment, the second core may be of a second type, such as a wide in-order core. Alternatively, the first type may be a wide in-order core and the second type may be a narrow out-of-order core. At block 506, the number of instructions per cycle for the first core (IPC1) may be collected for M cycles. In an embodiment, monitoring performance and collecting statistics may be performed by one of Monitor Module 305 or Code Distribution Module 210. Next, prediction for continuing execution on the first core (Pcont) may be performed as follows. At block 508, if the number of continuations N is less than the maximum number of continuations K, and the number of instructions per cycle for the first core IPC1 is greater than a previous number of instructions per cycle (Prev_IPC, initially set to a maximum value), then blocks 510, 512, and 514 may be performed. In this case, a switch from the first core to the second core is not done. At block 510, power down of the second core may be signaled. At block 512, the previous number of instructions per cycle Prev_IPC may be set to Prev_IPC multiplied by the Inflation Factor. Processing continues with continued execution of the program code on the first core. If the number of continuations N is less than or equal to the maximum number of continuations K, or the number of instructions per cycle for the first core IPC1 is less than or equal to than a previous number of instructions per cycle Prev_IPC at block 508, then blocks 516, 518, and 520 may be performed. In this case, a switch from the first core to the second core may be done. Next, prediction for switching execution (Pswit) from the first core to the second core may be performed as follows. At block 516, counter N may be set to 0. At block 518, execution of the program code may be switched from the first core to the second core and the number of instructions per cycle for the second core (IPC2) may be collected. Next, a check is made to verify that the switch was worthwhile. At block 520, if the number of instructions per cycle on the second core (IPC2) is less than the number of instructions per cycle on the first core (IPC1), then execution of the program code may be switched from the second core back to the first core at block 522. Alternatively, if another performance metric is used other than number of instructions per cycle, then if performance on the second core is not better than performance on the first core, then execution of the program code may be switched from the second core back to the first core. Power down of the second core may then be signaled at block 524. However, if at block 520 the number of instructions per cycle on the second core (IPC2) is not less than the number of instructions per cycle on the first core (IPC1), then the switching of cores is worthwhile. Alternatively, if another performance metric is used other than number of instructions per cycle, then if performance on the second core is better than or equal to performance on the first core, then switching of cores is worthwhile. At block 528, power down of the first core may be signaled. In either case, processing continues in one embodiment at block 530 with a setting of the previous number of instructions per cycle (Prev_IPC) to the average of the IPC values (e.g., IPC1+IPC2\/2). Although we use arithmetic mean as the average here, we can also use geometric mean, harmonic mean, and any other means to present the average of the two IPC values. Processing is now performed on the second core with the first core being powered down. In a subsequent iteration of the method, positions of the first core and the second core in the method may be swapped (e.g., so the second core is executed first for S cycle, signal power up of the first core, performance of the second core is monitored for M cycles, statistics about the second core are collected, and so on). In an embodiment, at least blocks 504 through 530 may be performed by Code Distribution Module 210. Core switching involves several overheads: 1) activating the other core which may be in a low power state; 2) transferring x86 register states to the other core; 3) moving frequently accessed data into the other data cache; and 4) warming up instruction cache, branch predictor state, and other states on the other core. The latency to wake up (or power up) the other core depends on the low power state in which the other core is in. In some embodiments, if the core is in the low power C2 state, which consumes .about.30% of regular operating power, it may take .about.5000 cycles to power the core up to normal operating speed (CO state). If the core is in deeper power-down state (C6), which consumes<10% of operating power, it can take .about.200K cycles to wake up in one embodiment. Although the power-up takes time, it can be done in parallel with the execution on the other core. For example, in an embodiment before the first core enters the Pswit\/Pcont period, the first core (or other module) can send a signal to the second core to initiate power-up. At the end of the first core's prediction period, the second core may be already powered up and can continue execution of the program code. With this early power-up strategy, power-up latency should affect neither the core switch latency nor the performance, although it increases energy consumption. In an embodiment, data and instruction caches may take up to 10K cycles to warm-up, even if the level 2 (L2) cache is shared among the two cores. Also, modern hybrid branch predictors allow the branch predictor to be warmed up fairly quickly. Assume the core power up takes PU cycles and the branch predictor and L1 cache warm-up takes WU cycles. FIG. 6 illustrates the core switching action and overhead. The representations of time in FIG. 6 are merely illustrative and are not meant to convey any actual, specific timing relationships between the various stages. Before the first core 601 enters the Pcont period, the first core signals the second core 602 to power-up 603. After the first core finishes its Pcont operation and finds that a core switch may be needed, program code execution may be switched to the second core 604. At that time, the second core has already been powered up, and starts its warm-up for WU cycles 605. After the warm-up period, the second core runs for a short time (e.g., M cycles) to collect its performance data 606. Let's assume that at that time the second core's performance is better than the first core's performance, so the second core signals the first core to power down (PD) 607, and continues execution on the second core. Near the end of the next Pcont period, the second core signals to the first core to power-up 608. After the second core finishes its Pcont period and finds that the second core should continue execution, the second core signals the first core to power-down 609 and continues execution of the program code on the second core. As a result of coupling a native core with a different co-designed core, the best of power and execution benefits are potentially obtained even within a single application when using dynamic core selection techniques as discussed herein. For example, with an out-of-order core and a software managed, in-order core, code that is not efficient on the software-managed core is migrated to the out-of-order core. And inversely, the code that is not efficient on the out-of-order core is migrated to the software managed core. Through hardware, software, firmware, or a combination therefore parallel execution of native code, hot code detecting, and hot code optimization may be efficiently managed, while individual sections of multiple threads may be efficiently interleaved in a pipelined fashion between the out-of-order and in-order co-designed cores. As a result, maximum performance may be obtained, while achieving better power performance through different power efficiency techniques, such as placing the out-of-order core in a low power state during execution on the in-order core in some implementations. A module as used herein refers to any hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Often module boundaries that are illustrated as separate commonly vary and potentially overlap. For example, a first and a second module may share hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof, while potentially retaining some independent hardware, software, or firmware. In one embodiment, use of the term logic includes hardware, such as transistors, registers, or other hardware, such as programmable logic devices. However, in another embodiment, logic also includes software or code integrated with hardware, such as firmware or micro-code. A value, as used herein, includes any known representation of a number, a state, a logical state, or a binary logical state. Often, the use of logic levels, logic values, or logical values is also referred to as 1's and 0's, which simply represents binary logic states. For example, a 1 refers to a high logic level and 0 refers to a low logic level. In one embodiment, a storage cell, such as a transistor or flash cell, may be capable of holding a single logical value or multiple logical values. However, other representations of values in computer systems have been used. For example the decimal number ten may also be represented as a binary value of 1010 and a hexadecimal letter A. Therefore, a value includes any representation of information capable of being held in a computer system. Moreover, states may be represented by values or portions of values. As an example, a first value, such as a logical one, may represent a default or initial state, while a second value, such as a logical zero, may represent a non-default state. In addition, the terms reset and set, in one embodiment, refer to a default and an updated value or state, respectively. For example, a default value potentially includes a high logical value, i.e. reset, while an updated value potentially includes a low logical value, i.e. set. Note that any combination of values may be utilized to represent any number of states. The embodiments of methods, hardware, software, firmware or code set forth above may be implemented via instructions or code stored on a machine readable medium which are executable by a processing element. A machine-readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (i.e., stores and\/or transmits) information in a form readable by a machine, such as a computer or electronic system. For example, a machine-readable medium includes random-access memory (RAM), such as static RAM (SRAM) or dynamic RAM (DRAM); ROM; magnetic or optical storage medium; flash memory devices; electrical storage devices; optical storage devices; etc. Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention.

As a result, computer system configurations have evolved from a single or multiple integrated circuits in a system to multiple cores, multiple hardware threads, and multiple logical processors present on individual integrated circuits.

FIG. 6 illustrates core switch operations and overhead according to an embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS A heterogeneous computing strategy is to integrate a number of cores, wherein each core is efficient at executing certain code but inefficient at executing certain other code. The runtime software (SW) and hardware (HW) collaboratively partition the input program into code segments suitable for different cores, and execute each of them on the most appropriate core, while putting the other cores in low power state, to achieve high performance with low power and energy consumption. One example of such a system consists of at least one wide-in-order core and at least one narrow out-of-order core, and according to embodiments of the present invention, this heterogeneous system can achieve improved out-of-order core performance while consuming a fraction of energy and power. A major challenge for this type of computing system is to identify program behavior changes quickly and switch to the appropriate core efficiently at runtime. Embodiments of the present invention use runtime software and\/or hardware to automatically switch execution of different code segments in the same program to the most appropriate core, and significantly speed up performance of single threaded programs. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific types of processor cores, specific processor configurations, specific hot code region identification algorithms, specific structures for storing translated\/optimized code, specific division of tasks between hardware\/software, specific processor units\/logic, etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that these specific details need not be employed to practice the present invention. In other instances, well known components or methods, such as specific and alternative processor architecture, specific logic circuits\/code for described algorithms, specific code implementations, specific binary translation details, and other specific operational details of microprocessors haven't been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. In one embodiment, the method and apparatus described herein are for implementing a native core with a software-managed core to achieve maximum performance and power savings. Specifically, the collaboration between cores is discussed primarily in reference to an out-of-order core and an in-order, co-designed core. Yet, the apparatus' and methods described herein are not so limited, as they may be implemented in any distribution of code between heterogeneous cores. For example, the code distribution methods and apparatus' described herein may be utilized with two out-of-order cores that implement unique Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). Furthermore, the collaboration between such cores is often discussed as split between hardware mechanisms and code\/software. However, any blend or exclusive use of hardware, software, and\/or firmware may be utilized to implement the methods and apparatus' described below. Referring to FIG. 1, an embodiment of a processor including multiple cores is illustrated. Processor 100 includes any processor, such as a microprocessor, an embedded processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), a network processor, or other device to execute code. Processor 100, in one embodiment, includes at least two cores\u2014core 101 and 102\u2014of different types. However, processor 100 may include any number of processing elements. In one embodiment, a processing element refers to a thread unit, a thread slot, a process unit, a context, a logical processor, a hardware thread, a core, and\/or any other element, which is capable of holding a state for a processor, such as an execution state or architectural state. In other words, a processing element, in one embodiment, refers to any hardware capable of being independently associated with code, such as a software thread, operating system, application, or other code. A physical processor typically refers to an integrated circuit, which potentially includes any number of other processing elements, such as cores or hardware threads. A core often refers to logic located on an integrated circuit capable of maintaining an independent architectural state wherein each independently maintained architectural state is associated with at least some dedicated execution resources. In contrast to cores, a hardware thread typically refers to any logic located on an integrated circuit capable of maintaining an independent architectural state wherein the independently maintained architectural states share access to execution resources. As can be seen, when certain resources are shared and others are dedicated to an architectural state, the line between the nomenclature of a hardware thread and core overlaps. Yet often, a core and a hardware thread are viewed by an operating system as individual logical processors, where the operating system is able to individually schedule operations on each logical processor. Physical processor 100, as illustrated in FIG. 1, includes two cores, core 101 and 102. Here, core 101 and 102 are considered heterogeneous cores, i.e. cores with different configurations, functional units, and\/or logic. In one embodiment, core 101 includes an out-of-order processor core, while core 102 includes an in-order processor core. However, cores 101 and 102 may be individually selected from any type of core. Yet to further the discussion, the functional units illustrated in FIG. 1 are described in further detail below. As depicted, core 101 includes two hardware threads 101a and 101b, which may also be referred to as hardware thread slots 101a and 101b. In contrast, core 102 includes one hardware thread 102a. Therefore, software entities, such as an operating system, in one embodiment potentially view processor 100 as three separate processors, i.e. three logical processors or processing elements capable of executing three software threads concurrently. Alternatively, a software entity may only view processor 100 as having two separate processors\u2014thread slots 101a and 101b\u2014while the described code distribution mechanisms manage execution of code on core 102. A first thread is associated with architecture state registers 101a, a second thread is associated with architecture state registers 101b, and a third thread may be associated with architecture state registers 102a. As illustrated, architecture state registers 101a are replicated in architecture state registers 101b, so individual architecture states\/contexts are capable of being stored for logical processor 101a and logical processor 101b. Architecture state registers 102a may be the same as registers 101a, 101b. Or registers 102a may instead be unique to the architecture of core 102. In core 101, other smaller resources, such as instruction pointers and renaming logic in rename allocator logic 130 may also be replicated for threads 101a and 101b. Some resources, such as re-order buffers in reorder\/retirement unit 135, instruction-translation buffer (ITLB) 120, load\/store buffers, and queues may be shared through partitioning. Other resources, such as general purpose internal registers, page-table base register, low-level data-cache and data-TLB 150, execution unit(s) 140, and portions of out-of-order unit 135 are potentially fully shared. Processor 100 often includes other resources, which may be fully shared, shared through partitioning, or dedicated by\/to processing elements. In FIG. 1, an embodiment of a purely exemplary processor with illustrative logical units\/resources of a processor is illustrated. Note that a processor may include, or omit, any of these functional units, as well as include any other known functional units, logic, or firmware not depicted. As illustrated, core 101 is illustrated as a simplified out-of-order (OOO) processor core. The OOO core includes a branch target buffer (BTB) 120 to predict branches to be executed\/taken and an instruction-translation buffer (I-TLB) 120 to store address translation entries for instructions. Core 101 further includes decode module 125 coupled to fetch unit 120 to decode fetched elements. Fetch logic, in one embodiment, includes individual sequencers associated with thread slots 101a, 101b, respectively. Usually core 101 is associated with a first Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), which defines\/specifies instructions executable on processor 100. Here, often machine code instructions that are part of the first ISA include a portion of the instruction (referred to as an opcode), which references\/specifies an instruction or operation to be performed. Decode logic 125 includes circuitry that recognizes these instructions from their opcodes and passes the decoded instructions on in the pipeline for processing as defined by the first ISA. In one example, allocator and renamer block 130 includes an allocator to reserve resources, such as register files to store instruction processing results. However, threads 101a and 101b are potentially capable of out-of-order execution, where allocator and renamer block 130 also reserves other resources, such as reorder buffers to track instruction status. Unit 130 may also include a register renamer to rename program\/instruction reference registers to other registers internal to processor 100. Reorder\/retirement unit 135 includes components, such as the reorder buffers mentioned above, load buffers, and store buffers, to support out-of-order execution and later in-order retirement of instructions executed out-of-order. Scheduler and execution unit(s) block 140, in one embodiment, includes a scheduler unit to schedule instructions\/operation on execution units. For example, a floating point instruction is scheduled on a port of an execution unit that has an available floating point execution unit. Register files associated with the execution units are also included to store information instruction processing results. Exemplary execution units include a floating point execution unit, an integer execution unit, a jump execution unit, a load execution unit, a store execution unit, and other known execution units. Lower level data cache and data address translation lookup\/side buffer (D-TLB) 150 are coupled to execution unit(s) 140. The data cache is to store recently used\/operated on elements, such as data operands, which are potentially held in memory coherency states. The D-TLB is to store recent virtual\/linear to physical address translations. As a specific example, a processor may include a page table structure to break physical memory into a plurality of virtual pages. As stated above, in one embodiment, core 102 includes an in-order, co-designed core. As a result, FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified pipeline of an in-order core. This pipeline includes fetch unit 121, decode unit 126, execution unit(s) 141, and a lower-level data cache 151. These units may work in a similar manner to the corresponding units in core 101. Yet, in an in-order core, the instructions\/operations are executed in program order, instead of potential out-of-order execution as in core 101. In one example, out-of-order core 101 is referred to as the native core, while the in-order core 102 is referred to as a co-designed core. Alternatively, in-order core 102 is the native core and out-of-order core 101 is the co-designed core. Here, cores 101 and 102 share access to higher-level or further-out cache 110, which is to cache recently fetched elements. Note that higher-level or further-out refers to cache levels increasing or getting further way from the execution unit(s). In one embodiment, higher-level cache 110 is a last-level data cache\u2014last cache in the memory hierarchy on processor 100\u2014such as a second or third level data cache. However, higher level cache 110 is not so limited, as it may be associated with or include an instruction cache. A trace cache\u2014a type of instruction cache\u2014instead may be coupled after decoder 125 to store recently decoded traces. In the depicted configuration, processor 100 also includes link interface module 105 to communicate with devices external to processor 100, such as system memory 175, a chipset, a northbridge, or other integrated circuit (including single integrated circuit implementations such as a \u201csystem on a chip\u201d (SOC)). Memory 175 may be dedicated to processor 100 or shared with other devices in a system. Common examples of types of memory 175 include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static RAM (SRAM), non-volatile memory (NV memory), and other known storage devices. In one embodiment, code is distributed between core 101 and 102 based on maximizing performance and power. For example, code regions are identified to perform better on one of the two cores 101, 102. As a result, when one of such code regions is encountered\/detected, that code section is distributed to the appropriate core. Identification of such regions may be done statically (before execution of the code, such as through program profile analysis) or dynamically (during execution of the code) by hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In one illustrative example of a dynamic approach, one processor core, such as core 101, may be selected as a default core to execute code based on its performance, power-savings, native ISA, any other known processing consideration, or a combination thereof. Then, regions of the default code that execute poorly on core 101, or would execute better on core 102, are identified. Upon subsequently encountering those identified code sections, they are distributed to core 102 for execution. Note that execution of those regions on core 102 may include speculative, run-ahead execution to warm-up core 101, serial execution of those regions on core 102 with execution of other regions on core 101 that depend on results from those regions, or parallel, concurrent execution of those regions with execution of other code on core 102. In an example of a static approach, a compiler or user may identify sections of code, such as with instructions or demarcations, which execute better on one core or the other. Here, core 101 executes code until such an instruction is encountered. Either in response to monitoring from core 102 or by sole initiative (triggering) of core 102, the identified code section is then executed on core 102 based on the encountered instruction. Whether identification of code sections to run better on one core or another is done dynamically or statically, in some embodiments, native code is translated and\/or optimized to be run on another core. For example, assume core 101 includes decode logic 125 that recognizes a first ISA type, and core 102 includes decode logic 126 that recognizes a second ISA type. In this case, if a code region of the first ISA type is to be executed on core 102, then the code region is translated to the second ISA type to be executed on core 102. Note that translation between ISA types is purely illustrative. Instead, out-of-order optimized code to be executed on core 101 may be re-optimized for execution of in-order core 102. In this scenario, core 102 may include the same, or a subset of, the same ISA as core 101. Yet, optimizations are performed on the code to ensure it runs more efficiently on a simple, wide in-order core. The collaboration between core 101 and core 102 to distribute code efficiently may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. The example above regarding a dynamic approach to identifying code regions is further examined to illustrate exemplary embodiments of collaboration mechanisms. In the example, program code, in a native format, is optimized to execute on out-of-order core 101. During execution of a code region or the program code, monitor hardware associated with core 101 and\/or core 102 may be utilized to determine the performance associated with core 101's execution of the code region. Alternatively, code, such as software, OS code, micro-code, or other code, may be executed on core 102, to determine\/monitor the performance of core 101 in executing the code region. If it's determined that the code region would be better executed on core 102, then hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof may be utilized to translate and\/or optimize the code region to be executed on core 102. As a result, when core 101 encounters the code region again\u2014an instruction pointer references the code region, an identifier instruction to identify the code region is fetched or decoded, or another way of identifying a code region is detected\u2014then the translated\/optimized version of the code region is executed on core 102. In one embodiment, during execution of the code region on core 102, core 101 may concurrently execute other code regions to increase overall program execution performance Note that concurrent or parallel execution may include execution of separate software threads on cores 101, 102 as well. In contrast, threads may be pipelined on cores 101, 102. As an example of this scenario, assume each of the two software threads includes multiple stages of code (hot, cold, etc). Here, cold code from a first thread may be executed on core 101, and when a hot region is encountered, a translated hot region is executed on core 102. During execution of the translated hot region of code on core 102, cold code from the second thread may be executed on core 101. On core 102, when execution of the first translated hot code completes, execution of another hot region from the second software thread may then be started. As can be seen from this example, the stages of code may be interleaved on each core resulting in a pipelined type of execution. In another embodiment, code may be executed sequentially with respect to the two cores, such as a code region on core 101, the identified code region on core 102, and then subsequently another code region on core 101. In addition, even when a code region is initially identified for execution on core 102, the performance of that execution may also be monitored. The performance on both cores may then be taken into account in determining which core is best suited to execute the code region to achieve maximum performance and power savings. For example, if a code region is identified to be executed as translated code on core 102, but the performance on core 102 is below the performance on core 101 (or the performance gain on core 102 doesn't outweigh the power savings of execution on core 201), then the code may be re-distributed to core 101 upon subsequent encounters. FIG. 1 illustrates an abstracted, logical view of an exemplary processor with a representation of different modules, units, and\/or logic. However, note that a processor utilizing the methods and apparatus' described herein need not include the illustrated units. And, the processor may omit some or all of the units shown. Furthermore, a majority of the discussion above has been in reference to an out-of-order processor core and an in-order processor core. However, as aforementioned, the two processor cores may be any version of heterogeneous cores, such as a native core and a software managed core. In addition, FIG. 1 only depicts two cores; yet, a processor may include any number of cores, such as multiple cores of the same type, as well as more than two cores that each differ in type. FIG. 1 also illustrates an embodiment of processor that is coupled in a point-to-point fashion with an interface to an external memory controller (controller hub 170). However, many current processors have begun including an on-processor memory interface module\u2014an on-chip module\u2014with a ring configuration to interconnect multiple cores, as well as shared caches and other interfaces. Although not illustrated, processor 100, in one embodiment, includes a ring interconnect coupling core, cache, and memory controller components. Here, caching agents are utilized to manage a slice of a physically distributed cache. As an example, each cache component is to manage a slice of a cache for a collocated core\u2014a core the cache agent is associated with for purpose of managing the distributed slice of the cache. Much like cache agents handle traffic on a ring interconnect and interface with cache slices, core agents\/components are to handle traffic and interface with cores. Additionally, the ring interconnect may couple Memory Controller Interface Logic (MCIL) and\/or other controllers to interface with other modules, such memory and\/or a graphics processor. Referring to FIG. 2 an embodiment of a code distribution module to distribute code among two cores is illustrated. In one embodiment, cores 201, 202 are heterogeneous cores. For example, core 201 is an out-of-order (OOO) core adapted to execute code out of original program order, and core 202 is an in-order (or serial core) adapted to execute code in program order. A non-exhaustive exemplary list of other core types include: a native core, a non-native core, a software managed core, a native ISA core, a translated ISA core, a co-designed core, a speculative execution core, and a non-speculative execution core. In one embodiment, code distribution module 210 is to distribute code between core 201 and 202 based on maximizing performance and power savings. A module as used herein may refer to hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Additionally, a module, unit, or logic may be centralized in a core or processor, as well as distributed throughout. For example, code distribution module 210 may include distribution code, such as micro-code or software, held in storage associated with core 201, core 202, processor 200, or a system including processor 200. Here, the distribution code, when executed, is to perform the code distribution. In contrast, the code distribution process may be managed by hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, code distribution module 210 is to dynamically switch execution of program code from one core to another. Dynamically switching program code is discussed in more detail below in reference to FIG. 4 and FIG. 5. However, as an illustrative example for this section of discussion, program code may include any code to be executed with a processing element, such as binary or machine code. A hot portion of code may refer to a portion of code that is better suited to execute on one core over the other based on considerations, such as power, performance, heat, other known processor metric(s), or a combination thereof. Here, assuming core 201 is a default core for native execution of the program code, then identification of a hot portion of the program code includes determining a portion of code that is better suited to be executed on core 202. In the embodiment where core 201 is an OOO core and core 202 is an in-order core, then a hot portion of code may refer to a hot spot of the program code that is better suited to be executed on serial core 202, which potentially has more available resources for execution of a highly-recurrent section. As an example, a hot portion of code is identified by a recurrence pattern of the portion of code, or some other known metric, such as instruction count or cycle count. Often a section of code with a high-recurrence and predictable latency pattern may be optimized to be executed more efficiently on an in-order core. Essentially, in this example, cold code (low-recurrence) is distributed to native, OOO core 101, while hot code (high-recurrence) is distributed to software-managed, in-order core 102. A hot portion of code may be identified statically, dynamically, or a combination thereof. In the first case, a compiler or user may determine a section of program code is hot code. Here, a hot code identifier instruction(s) may demarcate a section of code as hot, i.e. to be executed on core 202 instead of on core 101. Decode logic in core 201, in one embodiment, is adapted to decode a hot code identifier instruction from the program code, which is to identify the hot portion of the program code. The fetch or decode of such an instruction may trigger translation and\/or execution of the hot section of code on core 202. In this example, the code distribution module 210 includes the decode logic to detect the hot code detection instruction. And module 210 may also include other hardware and\/or software to carry out the translation\/optimization, as well as the execution of the hot code on core 202. Alternatively, the hot-code section may be pre-optimized\/translated for execution on core 202. In another example, code distribution module 210 dynamically (during execution) identifies hot spots\/regions in program code. In one embodiment, hardware included in core 201 and\/or core 202 is utilized to profile execution of the program code on a core, such as core 201. Based on the characteristics of the profile\u2014power and\/or performance metrics associated with execution\u2014a region of the program code may be identified as hot code. Similar to the operation of hardware, monitoring code may be executed on one core, such as core 202, to perform the monitoring\/profiling of program code being executed on the other core, such as core 201. Note that such monitoring code may be code held in storage structures within the cores, within processor 200, or held in a system including processor 200. For example, the monitoring code may be microcode, or other code, held in storage structures of core 201, core 202, or processor 200. And, the monitoring code may be executed by traditional execution units, as well as other firmware or logic on processor 200. As yet another example, a static identification of hot code is made as a hint. But dynamic profiling of the program code execution is able to ignore the static identification of a region of code as hot; this type of static identification is often referred to as a compiler or user hint that dynamic profiling may take into account in determining which core is appropriate for code distribution. Moreover, as is the nature of dynamic profiling, identification of a region of code as hot doesn't restrict that section of code to always being identified as hot. For example, assume program code is being executed on an out-of-order core 201. Monitor code executing on core 202 monitors the performance level of core 201's execution of a section of the program code. Based on the implementation, if the performance on core 201 is determined to be enough lower than it would perform on core 202 and\/or a recurrence pattern of the code section on core 201 is high-enough to be predicted to hide core transition overhead; then the code section is identified as hot. After translation and\/or optimization, a translated version of the code section is executed on core 202. Similar to the monitoring of execution on core 201, the execution of the translated version of code may be monitored on core 202, such as through execution of the performance monitoring code. If the performance is lower on core 202 than on core 201, then the identification of the code section as hot may be dynamically reversed (the section of hot code may be relabeled as cold code). Once a section, spot, or region of codes is identified as hot, code distribution module 210, in one embodiment, optimizes and\/or translates the hot section of code to obtain optimized\/translated hot code. In one embodiment, translation and\/or optimization code, such as binary translation code, is held in storage logic of core 202. As an example, the binary translation code may be part of micro-code held in core 202. The translation\/optimization code, when executed, translates\/optimizes the code section for execution on core 202. In one embodiment, core 201, 202 may recognize the same ISA, or a subset thereof, where translation\/optimization is merely translating\/optimizing code to execute more efficiently on core 202. In another embodiment, core 201, 202 recognize different ISAs, where translation includes translating the code region from one ISA recognizable by core 201 to another ISA recognizable by core 202. Although translation\/optimization is discussed in reference to execution of translation\/optimization code, any known mechanism for translating\/optimizing code, even through exclusive hardware, may be utilized. In one embodiment, upon encountering an identified section of hot code with core 201, the hot code (a translated version thereof) is executed on core 202. Any known trigger for determining when a hot code region is encountered may be utilized. A few high-level examples include: encountering\/referencing an instruction address associated with the code region, fetching\/decoding\/scheduling\/executing an instruction identifying a code section as hot code, fetching\/decoding\/scheduling\/executing an instruction indicating a translated version of hot code is to be executed on another core, an external trigger from a monitor indicating a hot code region has been encountered, etc. As an illustrative example, code distribution module 210 includes a monitor module implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. When the monitor module identifies a hot region of code or translates the hot region to a translated region, the monitor module registers an instruction address associated with the hot region of code. This registration may include association of the instruction address with a location of the translated region of code. Then, when an instruction pointer (program counter) subsequently references the instruction address, its determined from the registered instruction address that a hot region of code has been encountered. Note that any form of detection may be used here, such as a synchronous or asynchronous interrupt style of handling the encounter event. Additionally, hardware, micro-code, and\/or firmware may be capable of directly handling the encounter of a hot code section without interrupt-like handling, i.e. the trigger event is not serviced by a handler. Note that core 101 and 102 may share certain hardware structures, such as a mapping structure, to identify addresses that are registered as hot code. In response to encountering a hot code section on core 201, a translated and\/or optimized version of the hot code section is executed on core 202. Despite how the hot code section is identified and encountered on core 201, any known method for enabling execution of code on another core may be utilized. In one embodiment, a collaboration module is utilized to enable such execution. For example, cores 201, 202 may share certain hardware structures and\/or include communication channels to share information. As one example, cores 101, 102 may share a data cache, so when execution is migrated from core 201 to 202, the data isn't physically moved, but rather is already resident in the shared cache. Similarly, a register file, such as a shadow register file, in one embodiment, is shared between cores 201 and 202, so register states (context) doesn't have to be migrated from one core to another. As an alternative, instead of sharing a register file, a high-speed interconnect may be used to physically migrate context, or a portion thereof, from one core to another. Additionally, with infrequent transfers software may be utilized to perform such transfers. As one example, input values into a hot code-section are transferred from core 201 to core 202 to support execution of the hot-code section on core 202. After execution, output values are then transferred back to core 201. In one embodiment, only identified input\/output values from code sections are transferred, i.e. a partial context switch. Note that such input values may be identified by the user (software\/compiler) and\/or by hardware\/firmware algorithms. Here, direct access hardware may be adapted to read input values from registers, buffers, or other structures in core 201 and write them to core 202. Inversely, the same or different hardware may be utilized to read values from core 202 and write them to core 201. However, where identifying such values becomes too cumbersome, an entire context switch, replication, or sharing may be performed to provide values between cores 201 and 202. Referring next to FIG. 3, an embodiment of a processor for distributing code among cores to achieve maximum performance and power savings is depicted. As above, processor 300 includes two processor cores; each of which is of a different core type. As one example, core 301 is a native, out-of-order (OOO) processor core, while core 302 is a software managed, in-order processor core. Core 301 and 302 may, but are not required to, recognize different ISA types. In fact, core 302 may recognize a subset of core 301's ISA. Or, core 302 may include a separate ISA that partially overlaps core 301's ISA. As described above, a core or processor is often associated with an ISA\u2014a definition of recognized instruction\u2014by decode hardware\/software in the core or processor. In one embodiment, monitor module 305 is to monitor execution of native program code 325 on native, OOO core 301; through this monitoring, module 305 is to identify a hot portion\/region 327 of the program code 325. Monitor module may be comprised of hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, monitor module 305 includes hardware to monitor execution. As one example, the hardware includes micro-architectural and\/or architectural hooks, such as retirement pushout tags\/counters to measure retirement pushouts, instruction counters to count numbers of instructions, overall trace execution measurement logic to measure overall execution length and\/or time, recurrence counters to count a number of times a code section was executed, etc., to determine performance\/power metrics during execution of code 325. This type of hardware may be located in any portion of an integrated circuit\/processor, such as within out-of-order core 301, within in-order core 302, and in a non-associated portion of the integrated circuit that is not included within either OOO processor core 301 or the in-order processor core 302. In another embodiment, monitor module 305 includes software, such as monitor code, which when executed, is to monitor execution of program code 325 and to identify a hot region 327 of the program code 325. As an illustrative example, processor 300 includes storage structures, such as Read Only Memory (ROM) structures, programmable logic, etc, to hold code, microcode, or machine code, when executed, causes the monitoring to occur. However, monitor code may be stored in any machine readable medium associated with cores 301, 302. Note that use of the term execution is not only limited to execution by traditional execution units, but instead may refer to execution by other hardware or programmable logic associated with processor 300, such as execution of microcode with firmware. Here, the executed monitor code may perform the same monitoring of recurrence, power, and performance metric that is measureable by hardware. As one example, the monitoring hardware and\/or code tracks\/determines recurrence patterns for code sections of the program code. As a simple example, a data structure associates a reference to a code section (code region 327), such as an instruction address, with a count of the number of times the instruction address\/code section has been executed on core 301. Note that the count may be associated with an absolute count (total count) or a temporal count (a count over an amount of time). In one embodiment, monitor module 305 is adapted to identify\/detect a hot portion 327 of program code 325. Monitor module 305, in one example, is to measure one or more performance metric(s) for the hot portion 327 of the program code 325 during execution on OOO processor core 301. And module 305 is to identify the hot portion 327 of program code 325 in response to the performance metric(s) on the OOO processor core being below a threshold. A non-exhaustive, illustrative list of examples of performance metrics include: instruction retirement pushout, a number of instructions executed, an amount of time to execute a code region, a number of times a code regions is encountered\/executed, an amount of power consumed during execution of a code region, an amount of time spent in different power states during execution of a code region, a thermal density during execution of a code segment, etc. Using one of the examples above, assume OOO core 301 is executing program code 325. Monitor code is being executed to determine a number of times regions of program code 325 are executed on core 301. When that count meets or exceeds a threshold, in one embodiment, monitor module 305 identifies\/determines that region 327 is hot code. If a threshold value of three is used, then when monitor code executing on core 302 detects hot region 327 being re-executed a third time on core 301, region 327 is identified as a hot region of code. The specific example of determining a recurrence pattern may be extrapolated to see that a similar process\u2014count, compare against a threshold, and identify\u2014may be employed for any measured performance metric. Furthermore, determining a performance metric is not limited to simple counts, but may include any known algorithm for determining execution or power savings performance in a core, processor, or computer system. However, identifying hot region 327 within program code 325 is not limited to dynamic performance monitoring. Instead, compiler or static program analysis may be utilized to determine code sections that are likely to be better suited for execution on in-order core 302. For example, assume program analysis reveals that hot region 327 is likely to be re-executed a number of times. In response to this discovery, a compiler or user may insert instructions or demarcations identifying a section of code as hot code. Therefore, when decoders of core 301 encounter such instructions, they recognize that region 327 is hot code that is to be executed on core 302. Note that in some embodiments, users may identify such regions of code based on their knowledge of a program without in-depth program analysis. In one embodiment, in response to identifying region 327 as hot, code 327 is optimized or translated by optimization\/translation module 310 to obtain optimized hot code 304. Similar to operation of monitor module 305, optimization module 310 may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. For example, translation and\/or optimization code may be stored in structures associated with core 302, core 301, or processor 300. To illustrate, binary translation code is stored in firmware associated with core 302. And the binary translation code is executed to translate hot region 327 from a native format for core 301 to a format for core 302. Note that translation may be between ISAs or other formats, while optimization may include any known method for optimizing code for execution, such as known techniques for optimizing code from parallel execution on OOO core 301 to serial execution on core 302, as well as the inverse. However, use of binary translation code in firmware is purely illustrative, as any translation code or optimization code may be held anywhere in a computer system, such as microcode in core 302 or regular program code in a system memory. And, the optimization code may be executed in any manner to translate or optimize hot region 327 to obtain optimized hot code 304. In fact, any known methods or apparatus' for translating or optimizing code for a core, such as the methods and apparatus' known for translating code in current software managed processors may be used. Whether software, firmware, hardware, or a combination is to be used, translation may be performed statically or dynamically. In fact, much like monitoring may be done dynamically during runtime or statically before execution, translation and optimization may similarly be performed. In the example where a compiler or user identifies hot region 327, the optimization and translation may take place at that point (before execution). Here, a hot code identifier instruction may be utilized to both identify hot code region 327 and specify the location of the optimized\/translated code 304. However, no matter if section 327 is identified as hot code before or during execution, the optimization and translation, in some embodiments, takes place dynamically (during runtime). In one embodiment, hot region 327 is optimized\/translated in parallel with other execution. In one example, core 302 begins executing optimization code in parallel with core 301's execution of region 327. Here, monitor module 305 detects execution of hot code region 327 on core 301, so optimization is initiated on core 302. While further instructions from hot region 327 are still being executed on core 301, core 302 begins optimization. As a result, core 302 is essentially optimizing hot code 327 in parallel with execution of hot code 327 on core 301. In another example, core 301 executes other sections of program code 325 or other mutually exclusive code in parallel to core 302's optimization of hot code 327. In another embodiment, optimization of hot region 327 is done serially. For example, core 301 executes hot region 327, and then subsequently core 301 or 302 optimizes hot code region 327. In one embodiment, code 327 is stored at its original memory location and translated on the fly by core 302. However, in most cases, its more efficient to translate\/optimize an entire code section before execution. As a result, after optimization\/translation module 310 optimizes code for a core, such as core 302, the optimized hot code 304 is stored elsewhere. The other location for optimized hot code 304 may be another location in memory, such as a home, system memory location. Yet, since hot code 327 is often associated with frequent execution, its potentially advantageous to hold optimized version 304 closer to core 302. Therefore, in the illustrated embodiment, core 303 includes a code cache 303 to hold the optimized hot code 304. Note that code cache 303 may be a separate cache structure in core 302; a shared cache structure, such as a shared instruction or data cache in core 302; or other general storage structure associated with core 302. Referring back to the discussion of monitor module 305, one embodiment of encountering hot code region 327 includes a program counter referencing an instruction address associated with a code section. As depicted, mapping module 315 is to hold a code region reference, such as the instruction address, associated with optimized hot code reference 317. Essentially, an entry of mapping module 315 associates hot code region 327 with an optimized version thereof (optimized hot code 304). As an illustrative example, reference 316 includes an address, such as the instruction address, associated with hot region 327. In this scenario, when core 301 encounters (a program counter points to) the instruction address held in field 316 of mapping module 315, then monitor module 305 indicates that hot region 327 has been encountered and is to be executed on core 302. Collaboration module 320, which is briefly described above and discussed in more detail below, then facilitates the movement of data and\/or context to core 302 for execution. Determining hot region 327 has been encountered and is to be executed on core 302, in the above example, is only on reference 316. The association of field 317 with field 316 may then be utilized to quickly determine where optimized hot code version 304 of region 327 is located. As a result, field 317 may include any reference to the location of optimized hot code 304. A few simple examples of such a reference include: an address of an entry in code cache 303 holding optimized code 304, an offset from the start of code cache 303 to entry 304 holding optimized hot code, and a physical or linear address associated with entry 304. Mapping module 315 is illustrated in a simple table structure, which may be implemented and\/or maintained in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Yet, any known method for associating one location with another location may be utilized for associating hot code 327 with an optimized version thereof. Although not specifically illustrated, portions of monitor module 305 in combination with mapping module 315 may form a trigger module for indicating optimized hot code 304 is to be executed on core 302, instead of native code 327 on core 301. As an example, when a program counter for core 301 is moved to a next instruction address, trigger hardware checks that address against references stored in mapping hardware table 315. Here, assume the program counter points the instruction address that references code region 327 held in field 316. Then, the trigger hardware, based on the entry in mapping table 315, indicates that an optimized code region 304 for code region 327 exists. As a result, execution of code region 327 on core 301 may be elided, since an optimized version already exists and is to be executed on core 302. In one embodiment, core 301 halts execution (stops or transitions into a low power state) until core 302 completes execution of the optimized code. However, this may not take full advantage of the processing capacity of processor 300. Therefore, in another embodiment, core 301 interleaves execution of another software thread (code other than program code 325), while optimized hot code 304 is executing on core 302. As yet another example, core 301 may execute other portions of program code 325 speculatively, which essentially performs a run-ahead helper thread of execution, or executes other portions of code 325 that don't depend from code region 327 out-of-order. Collaboration module 320, in one embodiment, provides collaboration functionality between cores 301, 302. As the simplest example, collaboration module 320 includes an interconnect between cores 301, 302 to transfer information. Yet, in another embodiment collaboration module includes other hardware, which may be exclusive to individual cores or shared between, to facilitate the aforementioned collaboration. For example, core 302 may share a shadow register file of core 301, such that a full context switch of register state from core 301 to core 302 does not have to be performed when optimized hot code 304 is executed on core 302. Instead, core 302 is able to directly access the shadow register file in that scenario. However, collaboration module is not only limited to shared structures and\/or an interconnect. In fact, collaboration module 320 may include hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof to provide direct read and\/or write access to registers, storage structures, and buffers in both cores 301, 302. As a result, collaboration module 320, in one embodiment, is capable of transferring data\/register values needed for execution of optimized hot code from core 301 to core 302. And, it is also capable of transferring results back from core 302 to core 301 to enable subsequent proper execution on core 301. Although monitor module 305 has primarily been discussed in reference to monitoring execution on native core 301, monitor module 305, in one embodiment, is also to monitor execution of optimized code on core 302. As a result, monitor module 305 is capable of comparing performance of code section 327 on core 301 with performance of an optimized version 304 on core 302. Furthermore, when performance on core 302 is lower than performance on core 301, or the performance gain is small on core 302 in comparison to an increase in power consumption, then the decision to identify region 327 as hot code may be reversed. As an example, the entry of mapping module 315 indicating such a decision is de-allocated or invalidated; such that the next time core 301 encounters hot code 327, monitor module 305 does not detect reference 316 and does not indicate an optimized hot code version of region 327 should be executed on core 302. Essentially, the reversal sends the previously identified region 327 back to out-of-order core 301. As a specific illustrative example to further demonstrate this performance comparison, assume code region 327 is identified as hot code based on a high-recurrence pattern and a high-instruction execution count. As a result, code 327 is optimized by binary translation code resident on core 302 to obtain optimized code 304. When optimized code 304 is stored in code cache 303, an entry in mapping table 315 is created to associate code region 327 with optimized version 304. When core 301 next encounters a reference that matches the reference in field 316, then execution of optimized code 304 is triggered on core 302, instead of executing code region 327 on core 301. Note that collaboration module through transfer, sharing, or context switching provides the proper values from core 301 to core 302. During core 302's execution of optimized hot code 304, the same performance metric\u2014instruction execution count\u2014is tracked by monitor module 305. If the instruction execution count is less than code region 327 was executed on core 301, then the status quo of region 327 being identified as hot code continues in the future. However, if the instruction execution count is longer on core 302 or a significant power increase is detected, then the identification of region 327 as hot code may be reversed, as described above. In addition to providing communication between cores 301 and 302, collaboration module 320 may also include other features to manage multiple cores of different types. As a first example, a power manager implements a power algorithm to ensure both core 301 and 302 don't operation at maximum power at the same time. However, this example is purely illustrative. And other power algorithms may allow such maximum operation. As another power consideration, core 302 may reside in a power state below maximum (a low-power state) during monitoring of execution on core 301. For example, when core 301 is associated with mechanisms to perform its own monitoring, then core 302 doesn't need to be fully powered up until there is an optimized version of code to be executed. As a result, power is potentially saved by turning off core 302 until it's needed for execution. Inversely, core 301 may be powered down (put in a power state below maximum, such as an ACPI low power state or sleep state), while core 302 is executing optimized hot code. Dynamically switching execution from core to core involves two challenges: 1) timely and accurately predict the most appropriate core for a given segment of code, and 2) efficiently migrate execution between cores. In one embodiment, program execution on a first core may be identified by runtime software and\/or hardware (e.g. based on analyzed ILP in the code region), and then performance metrics and\/or statistics of the current core may be continuously collected by Monitor Module 305 to predict when the execution of program code should switch to a second core. This approach is highlighted in FIG. 4. Since this approach uses data from a single core to predict the other core's performance, in one embodiment the approach is called a \u201csingle-core-prediction\u201d algorithm. Turning to FIG. 4, an embodiment of a flow diagram for a method 400 of distributing code among a first core of a first type (such as an out-of-order core) and a second core of a second type (such as an in-order core) to achieve maximum performance and power savings is illustrated. Although the flows of FIG. 4 are illustrated in a substantially serial fashion, the flows may be performed in a different order, as well as in parallel. Furthermore, each of the flows may be performed utilizing hardware, firmware, or through execution of program code. Execution of program code on an out-of-order (OOO) processor core in a processor is monitored. Reference to program code, in one embodiment, refers to (1) execution of a compiler program(s), either dynamically or statically, to compile other program code; (2) execution of a main program, such as an operating system, hypervisor, application code, or other software program; (3) execution of other program code, such as libraries, associated with the main program code, (4) execution of other program code, such as helper threads or other tasks, which may not be directly associated with main program; or (5) a combination thereof. A compiler often includes a program or set of programs to translate source text\/code into target text\/code. Usually, compilation of program\/application code with a compiler is done in multiple phases and passes to transform hi-level programming language code into low-level machine or assembly language code. Yet, single pass compilers may still be utilized for simple compilation. A compiler may utilize any known compilation techniques and perform any known compiler operations, such as lexical analysis, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, code transformation, and code optimization. Larger compilers often include multiple phases, but most often these phases are included within two general phases: (1) a front-end, i.e., generally where syntactic processing, semantic processing, and some transformation\/optimization may take place, and (2) a back-end, i.e., generally where analysis, transformations, optimizations, and code generation takes place. Some compilers refer to a middle end, which illustrates the blurring of delineation between a front-end and back end of a compiler. As a result, reference to insertion, association, generation, or other operation of a compiler may take place in any of the aforementioned phases or passes, as well as any other known phases or passes of a compiler. In one embodiment, monitoring execution of program code by monitor module 305 comprises tracking a number of times code segments\/regions within the program code are executed. Code regions may be determined in any known manner of grouping instructions\/code. As an example, each time an instruction address associated with a code section is referenced by a program counter of the OOO core, a recurrence count is incremented. If the recurrence count for the code section exceeds a threshold, in one embodiment, the code section is identified as hot code. Either in conjunction with determining recurrence patterns or separately, monitoring execution of program code may include determining\/tracking a performance metric associated with code sections. As disclosed above, exemplary performance metrics may include: instruction retirement pushout, a number of instructions executed, an amount of time to execute a code region, a number of times a code regions is encountered\/executed, an amount of power consumed during execution of a code region, an amount of time spent in different power states during execution of a code region, and a thermal density during execution of a code segment. Yet, any known metric, or combination of metrics, associated with processor execution may be monitored during execution of the program code. At block 402, program code may be executed on a first core. In an embodiment, the first core may be of a first type, such as a narrow out-of-order core. At block 404, performance of the first core may be monitored as the first core executes the program code. At block 406, statistics on the performance may be collected. In an embodiment, the statistics may include branch miss rate, cache miss rate, etc. In an embodiment, monitoring performance and collecting statistics may be performed by Monitor Module 305. At block 408, the performance of executing the program code on a second core may be predicted based at least in part on the performance and statistics of executing the program code on the first core. In an embodiment, the second code may be of a second type, such as a wide in-order core. Alternatively, the first type may be a wide in-order core and the second type may be a narrow out-of-order core. In an embodiment, the prediction may be implemented as a function called \u201cpredict_performance\u201d At block 410, if the predicted performance of the second core to execute the program code is better than the monitored performance of the first core executing the program code, then the following actions may be performed. At block 412, the second core may be powered up from a low power or \u201csleep\u201d state. During the power up, the first core continues execution of the program. At block 414, execution of the program code may be switched from the first core to the second core. At block 416, the first core may be powered down to a sleep state. If the predicted performance of the second core is not better than the first core, execution of the program code on the first core may continue. In a subsequent iteration of the method, positions of the first core and the second core in the method may be swapped (e.g., so that the second core is executed first, performance of the second core is monitored, statistics about the second core are collected, performance of the first core is predicted, and so on). In an embodiment, blocks 404 through 416 may be performed by Code Distribution Module 210. The function predict_performance (core number, performance_core1, statistics_core1) uses the current core execution performance and statistics, performance_core1 and statistics_core1, to predict the performance of the execution on the second core. If the predicted performance is higher than that on the current core, the execution is switched to the other core. This approach is based on the assumption that it is possible to predict the other core's performance using the current core's performance information. Intuitively, a program execution with excessive cache\/branch misses should perform better on the narrow out-of-order core due to its ability to hide the miss latency by executing the later instructions out-of-order. On the other hand, a program with high instruction level parallelism (ILP) and low cache\/branch misses should run more efficiently on the wide-in-order core due to its high execution bandwidth. In an embodiment, to define the function predict_performance, one may first run n pieces of code, c1, . . . , cn, on both the first core and the second core and collect their respective performance information (p11, p12, . . . , p1n), (p21, p22, . . . , p2n), and statistics (s11, s12, . . . , s1n), (s21, s22, . . . , s2n), on the two cores respectively. Then one may find the best fit function F such that (F(p11,s11), F(p12,s12), . . . , F(p1n,s1n))-(p21, p22, . . . , p2n) and (F(p21,s21), F(p22,s22), . . . , F(p2n,s2n))-(p11, p12, . . . , p1n) is minimized. If the standard error of the best fit is small, one may use F as the function predict_performance. If the standard error is high, however, one may need to find more performance parameters to enhance the prediction accuracy. One advantage of this single-core-prediction approach is that it uses only the current core execution statistics to predict the performance of the other core, without the performance and power overhead of involving the other core in making the decision. However, this approach assumes that the performance of the two cores is closely correlated. In some environments\/configurations, the performance of the two cores may be only loosely correlated and a good fit function may not exist. Therefore it may be desirable to have a more general approach. In another embodiment, a dual-core-prediction process uses the performance information observed on two cores in a short period to predict the core switch. Specifically, a \u201cprediction\u201d may be performed at regular intervals to sample and compare the performance on the two cores to decide whether or not to switch the execution to a different core. Note that each prediction may involve two core switches: the first switch takes place to get the performance information from the other core, and the second switch may happen when the performance on the other core is not as good as that on the first core so the execution should switch back to the first core. The first core switch involves powering up the other core and warming up its micro-architectural state for execution, and the second switch only involves a core power-down. To reduce core switch overhead, the prediction may be separated into two operations: a \u201cprediction for continuation\u201d (Pcont) operation and a \u201cprediction for switch\u201d (Pswit). The Pcont operation compares the performance information collected on the current core with the previous performance information of the two cores to decide whether or not the execution should continue on the current core. If the Pcont operation predicts that the execution should not continue on the current core, the Pswit operation activates the other core to run the other core for a short time period and compare the performance information on the two cores to decide whether or not the execution should be switched to the other core. To prevent Pcont from continuing execution on the same core for too long, the parameter K is introduced to dictate that the Pswit operation cannot be skipped for more than K times in a row. Also, each time a Pswit operation is skipped, the previous performance is inflated by an Inflation Factor so that the next Pcont period will find it harder to skip the Pswit operation. The dual-core prediction process 500 is shown in FIG. 5. In an embodiment, S is the sampling interval (e.g., number of cycles between predictions), M is the sample length (e.g., in number of cycles) to collect performance on each core, PU is a number of cycles for powering up the second core, IPC is the number of instructions per cycle, K is the maximum number of continuations (K being a natural number), N is the number of continuations (initially set to 0), and Prev_IPC is the previous IPC (which may be initially set to MAX_FLOAT). In an embodiment, S, M, PU, K, and the Inflation Factor may be set to appropriate values. At block 502, program code may be executed on the first core for a sampling interval of S cycles. In an embodiment, the first core may be of a first type, such as a narrow out-of-order core. At block 504, power up of the second core may be signaled PU cycles before the end of S+M cycles from the start of program code execution. In an embodiment, the second core may be of a second type, such as a wide in-order core. Alternatively, the first type may be a wide in-order core and the second type may be a narrow out-of-order core. At block 506, the number of instructions per cycle for the first core (IPC1) may be collected for M cycles. In an embodiment, monitoring performance and collecting statistics may be performed by one of Monitor Module 305 or Code Distribution Module 210. Next, prediction for continuing execution on the first core (Pcont) may be performed as follows. At block 508, if the number of continuations N is less than the maximum number of continuations K, and the number of instructions per cycle for the first core IPC1 is greater than a previous number of instructions per cycle (Prev_IPC, initially set to a maximum value), then blocks 510, 512, and 514 may be performed. In this case, a switch from the first core to the second core is not done. At block 510, power down of the second core may be signaled. At block 512, the previous number of instructions per cycle Prev_IPC may be set to Prev_IPC multiplied by the Inflation Factor. Processing continues with continued execution of the program code on the first core. If the number of continuations N is less than or equal to the maximum number of continuations K, or the number of instructions per cycle for the first core IPC1 is less than or equal to than a previous number of instructions per cycle Prev_IPC at block 508, then blocks 516, 518, and 520 may be performed. In this case, a switch from the first core to the second core may be done. Next, prediction for switching execution (Pswit) from the first core to the second core may be performed as follows. At block 516, counter N may be set to 0. At block 518, execution of the program code may be switched from the first core to the second core and the number of instructions per cycle for the second core (IPC2) may be collected. Next, a check is made to verify that the switch was worthwhile. At block 520, if the number of instructions per cycle on the second core (IPC2) is less than the number of instructions per cycle on the first core (IPC1), then execution of the program code may be switched from the second core back to the first core at block 522. Alternatively, if another performance metric is used other than number of instructions per cycle, then if performance on the second core is not better than performance on the first core, then execution of the program code may be switched from the second core back to the first core. Power down of the second core may then be signaled at block 524. However, if at block 520 the number of instructions per cycle on the second core (IPC2) is not less than the number of instructions per cycle on the first core (IPC1), then the switching of cores is worthwhile. Alternatively, if another performance metric is used other than number of instructions per cycle, then if performance on the second core is better than or equal to performance on the first core, then switching of cores is worthwhile. At block 528, power down of the first core may be signaled. In either case, processing continues in one embodiment at block 530 with a setting of the previous number of instructions per cycle (Prev_IPC) to the average of the IPC values (e.g., IPC1+IPC2\/2). Although we use arithmetic mean as the average here, we can also use geometric mean, harmonic mean, and any other means to present the average of the two IPC values. Processing is now performed on the second core with the first core being powered down. In a subsequent iteration of the method, positions of the first core and the second core in the method may be swapped (e.g., so the second core is executed first for S cycle, signal power up of the first core, performance of the second core is monitored for M cycles, statistics about the second core are collected, and so on). In an embodiment, at least blocks 504 through 530 may be performed by Code Distribution Module 210. Core switching involves several overheads: 1) activating the other core which may be in a low power state; 2) transferring x86 register states to the other core; 3) moving frequently accessed data into the other data cache; and 4) warming up instruction cache, branch predictor state, and other states on the other core. The latency to wake up (or power up) the other core depends on the low power state in which the other core is in. In some embodiments, if the core is in the low power C2 state, which consumes .about.30% of regular operating power, it may take .about.5000 cycles to power the core up to normal operating speed (CO state). If the core is in deeper power-down state (C6), which consumes<10% of operating power, it can take .about.200K cycles to wake up in one embodiment. Although the power-up takes time, it can be done in parallel with the execution on the other core. For example, in an embodiment before the first core enters the Pswit\/Pcont period, the first core (or other module) can send a signal to the second core to initiate power-up. At the end of the first core's prediction period, the second core may be already powered up and can continue execution of the program code. With this early power-up strategy, power-up latency should affect neither the core switch latency nor the performance, although it increases energy consumption. In an embodiment, data and instruction caches may take up to 10K cycles to warm-up, even if the level 2 (L2) cache is shared among the two cores. Also, modern hybrid branch predictors allow the branch predictor to be warmed up fairly quickly. Assume the core power up takes PU cycles and the branch predictor and L1 cache warm-up takes WU cycles. FIG. 6 illustrates the core switching action and overhead. The representations of time in FIG. 6 are merely illustrative and are not meant to convey any actual, specific timing relationships between the various stages. Before the first core 601 enters the Pcont period, the first core signals the second core 602 to power-up 603. After the first core finishes its Pcont operation and finds that a core switch may be needed, program code execution may be switched to the second core 604. At that time, the second core has already been powered up, and starts its warm-up for WU cycles 605. After the warm-up period, the second core runs for a short time (e.g., M cycles) to collect its performance data 606. Let's assume that at that time the second core's performance is better than the first core's performance, so the second core signals the first core to power down (PD) 607, and continues execution on the second core. Near the end of the next Pcont period, the second core signals to the first core to power-up 608. After the second core finishes its Pcont period and finds that the second core should continue execution, the second core signals the first core to power-down 609 and continues execution of the program code on the second core. As a result of coupling a native core with a different co-designed core, the best of power and execution benefits are potentially obtained even within a single application when using dynamic core selection techniques as discussed herein. For example, with an out-of-order core and a software managed, in-order core, code that is not efficient on the software-managed core is migrated to the out-of-order core. And inversely, the code that is not efficient on the out-of-order core is migrated to the software managed core. Through hardware, software, firmware, or a combination therefore parallel execution of native code, hot code detecting, and hot code optimization may be efficiently managed, while individual sections of multiple threads may be efficiently interleaved in a pipelined fashion between the out-of-order and in-order co-designed cores. As a result, maximum performance may be obtained, while achieving better power performance through different power efficiency techniques, such as placing the out-of-order core in a low power state during execution on the in-order core in some implementations. A module as used herein refers to any hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Often module boundaries that are illustrated as separate commonly vary and potentially overlap. For example, a first and a second module may share hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof, while potentially retaining some independent hardware, software, or firmware. In one embodiment, use of the term logic includes hardware, such as transistors, registers, or other hardware, such as programmable logic devices. However, in another embodiment, logic also includes software or code integrated with hardware, such as firmware or micro-code. A value, as used herein, includes any known representation of a number, a state, a logical state, or a binary logical state. Often, the use of logic levels, logic values, or logical values is also referred to as 1's and 0's, which simply represents binary logic states. For example, a 1 refers to a high logic level and 0 refers to a low logic level. In one embodiment, a storage cell, such as a transistor or flash cell, may be capable of holding a single logical value or multiple logical values. However, other representations of values in computer systems have been used. For example the decimal number ten may also be represented as a binary value of 1010 and a hexadecimal letter A. Therefore, a value includes any representation of information capable of being held in a computer system. Moreover, states may be represented by values or portions of values. As an example, a first value, such as a logical one, may represent a default or initial state, while a second value, such as a logical zero, may represent a non-default state. In addition, the terms reset and set, in one embodiment, refer to a default and an updated value or state, respectively. For example, a default value potentially includes a high logical value, i.e. reset, while an updated value potentially includes a low logical value, i.e. set. Note that any combination of values may be utilized to represent any number of states. The embodiments of methods, hardware, software, firmware or code set forth above may be implemented via instructions or code stored on a machine readable medium which are executable by a processing element. A machine-readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (i.e., stores and\/or transmits) information in a form readable by a machine, such as a computer or electronic system. For example, a machine-readable medium includes random-access memory (RAM), such as static RAM (SRAM) or dynamic RAM (DRAM); ROM; magnetic or optical storage medium; flash memory devices; electrical storage devices; optical storage devices; etc. Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS A heterogeneous computing strategy is to integrate a number of cores, wherein each core is efficient at executing certain code but inefficient at executing certain other code. The runtime software (SW) and hardware (HW) collaboratively partition the input program into code segments suitable for different cores, and execute each of them on the most appropriate core, while putting the other cores in low power state, to achieve high performance with low power and energy consumption. One example of such a system consists of at least one wide-in-order core and at least one narrow out-of-order core, and according to embodiments of the present invention, this heterogeneous system can achieve improved out-of-order core performance while consuming a fraction of energy and power. A major challenge for this type of computing system is to identify program behavior changes quickly and switch to the appropriate core efficiently at runtime. Embodiments of the present invention use runtime software and\/or hardware to automatically switch execution of different code segments in the same program to the most appropriate core, and significantly speed up performance of single threaded programs. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific types of processor cores, specific processor configurations, specific hot code region identification algorithms, specific structures for storing translated\/optimized code, specific division of tasks between hardware\/software, specific processor units\/logic, etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that these specific details need not be employed to practice the present invention. In other instances, well known components or methods, such as specific and alternative processor architecture, specific logic circuits\/code for described algorithms, specific code implementations, specific binary translation details, and other specific operational details of microprocessors haven't been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. In one embodiment, the method and apparatus described herein are for implementing a native core with a software-managed core to achieve maximum performance and power savings. Specifically, the collaboration between cores is discussed primarily in reference to an out-of-order core and an in-order, co-designed core. Yet, the apparatus' and methods described herein are not so limited, as they may be implemented in any distribution of code between heterogeneous cores. For example, the code distribution methods and apparatus' described herein may be utilized with two out-of-order cores that implement unique Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). Furthermore, the collaboration between such cores is often discussed as split between hardware mechanisms and code\/software. However, any blend or exclusive use of hardware, software, and\/or firmware may be utilized to implement the methods and apparatus' described below. Referring to FIG. 1, an embodiment of a processor including multiple cores is illustrated. Processor 100 includes any processor, such as a microprocessor, an embedded processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), a network processor, or other device to execute code. Processor 100, in one embodiment, includes at least two cores\u2014core 101 and 102\u2014of different types. However, processor 100 may include any number of processing elements. In one embodiment, a processing element refers to a thread unit, a thread slot, a process unit, a context, a logical processor, a hardware thread, a core, and\/or any other element, which is capable of holding a state for a processor, such as an execution state or architectural state. In other words, a processing element, in one embodiment, refers to any hardware capable of being independently associated with code, such as a software thread, operating system, application, or other code. A physical processor typically refers to an integrated circuit, which potentially includes any number of other processing elements, such as cores or hardware threads. A core often refers to logic located on an integrated circuit capable of maintaining an independent architectural state wherein each independently maintained architectural state is associated with at least some dedicated execution resources. In contrast to cores, a hardware thread typically refers to any logic located on an integrated circuit capable of maintaining an independent architectural state wherein the independently maintained architectural states share access to execution resources. As can be seen, when certain resources are shared and others are dedicated to an architectural state, the line between the nomenclature of a hardware thread and core overlaps. Yet often, a core and a hardware thread are viewed by an operating system as individual logical processors, where the operating system is able to individually schedule operations on each logical processor. Physical processor 100, as illustrated in FIG. 1, includes two cores, core 101 and 102. Here, core 101 and 102 are considered heterogeneous cores, i.e. cores with different configurations, functional units, and\/or logic. In one embodiment, core 101 includes an out-of-order processor core, while core 102 includes an in-order processor core. However, cores 101 and 102 may be individually selected from any type of core. Yet to further the discussion, the functional units illustrated in FIG. 1 are described in further detail below. As depicted, core 101 includes two hardware threads 101a and 101b, which may also be referred to as hardware thread slots 101a and 101b. In contrast, core 102 includes one hardware thread 102a. Therefore, software entities, such as an operating system, in one embodiment potentially view processor 100 as three separate processors, i.e. three logical processors or processing elements capable of executing three software threads concurrently. Alternatively, a software entity may only view processor 100 as having two separate processors\u2014thread slots 101a and 101b\u2014while the described code distribution mechanisms manage execution of code on core 102. A first thread is associated with architecture state registers 101a, a second thread is associated with architecture state registers 101b, and a third thread may be associated with architecture state registers 102a. As illustrated, architecture state registers 101a are replicated in architecture state registers 101b, so individual architecture states\/contexts are capable of being stored for logical processor 101a and logical processor 101b. Architecture state registers 102a may be the same as registers 101a, 101b. Or registers 102a may instead be unique to the architecture of core 102. In core 101, other smaller resources, such as instruction pointers and renaming logic in rename allocator logic 130 may also be replicated for threads 101a and 101b. Some resources, such as re-order buffers in reorder\/retirement unit 135, instruction-translation buffer (ITLB) 120, load\/store buffers, and queues may be shared through partitioning. Other resources, such as general purpose internal registers, page-table base register, low-level data-cache and data-TLB 150, execution unit(s) 140, and portions of out-of-order unit 135 are potentially fully shared. Processor 100 often includes other resources, which may be fully shared, shared through partitioning, or dedicated by\/to processing elements. In FIG. 1, an embodiment of a purely exemplary processor with illustrative logical units\/resources of a processor is illustrated. Note that a processor may include, or omit, any of these functional units, as well as include any other known functional units, logic, or firmware not depicted. As illustrated, core 101 is illustrated as a simplified out-of-order (OOO) processor core. The OOO core includes a branch target buffer (BTB) 120 to predict branches to be executed\/taken and an instruction-translation buffer (I-TLB) 120 to store address translation entries for instructions. Core 101 further includes decode module 125 coupled to fetch unit 120 to decode fetched elements. Fetch logic, in one embodiment, includes individual sequencers associated with thread slots 101a, 101b, respectively. Usually core 101 is associated with a first Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), which defines\/specifies instructions executable on processor 100. Here, often machine code instructions that are part of the first ISA include a portion of the instruction (referred to as an opcode), which references\/specifies an instruction or operation to be performed. Decode logic 125 includes circuitry that recognizes these instructions from their opcodes and passes the decoded instructions on in the pipeline for processing as defined by the first ISA. In one example, allocator and renamer block 130 includes an allocator to reserve resources, such as register files to store instruction processing results. However, threads 101a and 101b are potentially capable of out-of-order execution, where allocator and renamer block 130 also reserves other resources, such as reorder buffers to track instruction status. Unit 130 may also include a register renamer to rename program\/instruction reference registers to other registers internal to processor 100. Reorder\/retirement unit 135 includes components, such as the reorder buffers mentioned above, load buffers, and store buffers, to support out-of-order execution and later in-order retirement of instructions executed out-of-order. Scheduler and execution unit(s) block 140, in one embodiment, includes a scheduler unit to schedule instructions\/operation on execution units. For example, a floating point instruction is scheduled on a port of an execution unit that has an available floating point execution unit. Register files associated with the execution units are also included to store information instruction processing results. Exemplary execution units include a floating point execution unit, an integer execution unit, a jump execution unit, a load execution unit, a store execution unit, and other known execution units. Lower level data cache and data address translation lookup\/side buffer (D-TLB) 150 are coupled to execution unit(s) 140. The data cache is to store recently used\/operated on elements, such as data operands, which are potentially held in memory coherency states. The D-TLB is to store recent virtual\/linear to physical address translations. As a specific example, a processor may include a page table structure to break physical memory into a plurality of virtual pages. As stated above, in one embodiment, core 102 includes an in-order, co-designed core. As a result, FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified pipeline of an in-order core. This pipeline includes fetch unit 121, decode unit 126, execution unit(s) 141, and a lower-level data cache 151. These units may work in a similar manner to the corresponding units in core 101. Yet, in an in-order core, the instructions\/operations are executed in program order, instead of potential out-of-order execution as in core 101. In one example, out-of-order core 101 is referred to as the native core, while the in-order core 102 is referred to as a co-designed core. Alternatively, in-order core 102 is the native core and out-of-order core 101 is the co-designed core. Here, cores 101 and 102 share access to higher-level or further-out cache 110, which is to cache recently fetched elements. Note that higher-level or further-out refers to cache levels increasing or getting further way from the execution unit(s). In one embodiment, higher-level cache 110 is a last-level data cache\u2014last cache in the memory hierarchy on processor 100\u2014such as a second or third level data cache. However, higher level cache 110 is not so limited, as it may be associated with or include an instruction cache. A trace cache\u2014a type of instruction cache\u2014instead may be coupled after decoder 125 to store recently decoded traces. In the depicted configuration, processor 100 also includes link interface module 105 to communicate with devices external to processor 100, such as system memory 175, a chipset, a northbridge, or other integrated circuit (including single integrated circuit implementations such as a \u201csystem on a chip\u201d (SOC)). Memory 175 may be dedicated to processor 100 or shared with other devices in a system. Common examples of types of memory 175 include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static RAM (SRAM), non-volatile memory (NV memory), and other known storage devices. In one embodiment, code is distributed between core 101 and 102 based on maximizing performance and power. For example, code regions are identified to perform better on one of the two cores 101, 102. As a result, when one of such code regions is encountered\/detected, that code section is distributed to the appropriate core. Identification of such regions may be done statically (before execution of the code, such as through program profile analysis) or dynamically (during execution of the code) by hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In one illustrative example of a dynamic approach, one processor core, such as core 101, may be selected as a default core to execute code based on its performance, power-savings, native ISA, any other known processing consideration, or a combination thereof. Then, regions of the default code that execute poorly on core 101, or would execute better on core 102, are identified. Upon subsequently encountering those identified code sections, they are distributed to core 102 for execution. Note that execution of those regions on core 102 may include speculative, run-ahead execution to warm-up core 101, serial execution of those regions on core 102 with execution of other regions on core 101 that depend on results from those regions, or parallel, concurrent execution of those regions with execution of other code on core 102. In an example of a static approach, a compiler or user may identify sections of code, such as with instructions or demarcations, which execute better on one core or the other. Here, core 101 executes code until such an instruction is encountered. Either in response to monitoring from core 102 or by sole initiative (triggering) of core 102, the identified code section is then executed on core 102 based on the encountered instruction. Whether identification of code sections to run better on one core or another is done dynamically or statically, in some embodiments, native code is translated and\/or optimized to be run on another core. For example, assume core 101 includes decode logic 125 that recognizes a first ISA type, and core 102 includes decode logic 126 that recognizes a second ISA type. In this case, if a code region of the first ISA type is to be executed on core 102, then the code region is translated to the second ISA type to be executed on core 102. Note that translation between ISA types is purely illustrative. Instead, out-of-order optimized code to be executed on core 101 may be re-optimized for execution of in-order core 102. In this scenario, core 102 may include the same, or a subset of, the same ISA as core 101. Yet, optimizations are performed on the code to ensure it runs more efficiently on a simple, wide in-order core. The collaboration between core 101 and core 102 to distribute code efficiently may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof. The example above regarding a dynamic approach to identifying code regions is further examined to illustrate exemplary embodiments of collaboration mechanisms. In the example, program code, in a native format, is optimized to execute on out-of-order core 101. During execution of a code region or the program code, monitor hardware associated with core 101 and\/or core 102 may be utilized to determine the performance associated with core 101's execution of the code region. Alternatively, code, such as software, OS code, micro-code, or other code, may be executed on core 102, to determine\/monitor the performance of core 101 in executing the code region. If it's determined that the code region would be better executed on core 102, then hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof may be utilized to translate and\/or optimize the code region to be executed on core 102. As a result, when core 101 encounters the code region again\u2014an instruction pointer references the code region, an identifier instruction to identify the code region is fetched or decoded, or another way of identifying a code region is detected\u2014then the translated\/optimized version of the code region is executed on core 102. In one embodiment, during execution of the code region on core 102, core 101 may concurrently execute other code regions to increase overall program execution performance Note that concurrent or parallel execution may include execution of separate software threads on cores 101, 102 as well. In contrast, threads may be pipelined on cores 101, 102. As an example of this scenario, assume each of the two software threads includes multiple stages of code (hot, cold, etc). Here, cold code from a first thread may be executed on core 101, and when a hot region is encountered, a translated hot region is executed on core 102. During execution of the translated hot region of code on core 102, cold code from the second thread may be executed on core 101. On core 102, when execution of the first translated hot code completes, execution of another hot region from the second software thread may then be started. As can be seen from this example, the stages of code may be interleaved on each core resulting in a pipelined type of execution. In another embodiment, code may be executed sequentially with respect to the two cores, such as a code region on core 101, the identified code region on core 102, and then subsequently another code region on core 101. In addition, even when a code region is initially identified for execution on core 102, the performance of that execution may also be monitored. The performance on both cores may then be taken into account in determining which core is best suited to execute the code region to achieve maximum performance and power savings. For example, if a code region is identified to be executed as translated code on core 102, but the performance on core 102 is below the performance on core 101 (or the performance gain on core 102 doesn't outweigh the power savings of execution on core 201), then the code may be re-distributed to core 101 upon subsequent encounters. FIG. 1 illustrates an abstracted, logical view of an exemplary processor with a representation of different modules, units, and\/or logic. However, note that a processor utilizing the methods and apparatus' described herein need not include the illustrated units. And, the processor may omit some or all of the units shown. Furthermore, a majority of the discussion above has been in reference to an out-of-order processor core and an in-order processor core. However, as aforementioned, the two processor cores may be any version of heterogeneous cores, such as a native core and a software managed core. In addition, FIG. 1 only depicts two cores; yet, a processor may include any number of cores, such as multiple cores of the same type, as well as more than two cores that each differ in type. FIG. 1 also illustrates an embodiment of processor that is coupled in a point-to-point fashion with an interface to an external memory controller (controller hub 170). However, many current processors have begun including an on-processor memory interface module\u2014an on-chip module\u2014with a ring configuration to interconnect multiple cores, as well as shared caches and other interfaces. Although not illustrated, processor 100, in one embodiment, includes a ring interconnect coupling core, cache, and memory controller components. Here, caching agents are utilized to manage a slice of a physically distributed cache. As an example, each cache component is to manage a slice of a cache for a collocated core\u2014a core the cache agent is associated with for purpose of managing the distributed slice of the cache. Much like cache agents handle traffic on a ring interconnect and interface with cache slices, core agents\/components are to handle traffic and interface with cores. Additionally, the ring interconnect may couple Memory Controller Interface Logic (MCIL) and\/or other controllers to interface with other modules, such memory and\/or a graphics processor. Referring to FIG. 2 an embodiment of a code distribution module to distribute code among two cores is illustrated. In one embodiment, cores 201, 202 are heterogeneous cores. For example, core 201 is an out-of-order (OOO) core adapted to execute code out of original program order, and core 202 is an in-order (or serial core) adapted to execute code in program order. A non-exhaustive exemplary list of other core types include: a native core, a non-native core, a software managed core, a native ISA core, a translated ISA core, a co-designed core, a speculative execution core, and a non-speculative execution core. In one embodiment, code distribution module 210 is to distribute code between core 201 and 202 based on maximizing performance and power savings. A module as used herein may refer to hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Additionally, a module, unit, or logic may be centralized in a core or processor, as well as distributed throughout. For example, code distribution module 210 may include distribution code, such as micro-code or software, held in storage associated with core 201, core 202, processor 200, or a system including processor 200. Here, the distribution code, when executed, is to perform the code distribution. In contrast, the code distribution process may be managed by hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, code distribution module 210 is to dynamically switch execution of program code from one core to another. Dynamically switching program code is discussed in more detail below in reference to FIG. 4 and FIG. 5. However, as an illustrative example for this section of discussion, program code may include any code to be executed with a processing element, such as binary or machine code. A hot portion of code may refer to a portion of code that is better suited to execute on one core over the other based on considerations, such as power, performance, heat, other known processor metric(s), or a combination thereof. Here, assuming core 201 is a default core for native execution of the program code, then identification of a hot portion of the program code includes determining a portion of code that is better suited to be executed on core 202. In the embodiment where core 201 is an OOO core and core 202 is an in-order core, then a hot portion of code may refer to a hot spot of the program code that is better suited to be executed on serial core 202, which potentially has more available resources for execution of a highly-recurrent section. As an example, a hot portion of code is identified by a recurrence pattern of the portion of code, or some other known metric, such as instruction count or cycle count. Often a section of code with a high-recurrence and predictable latency pattern may be optimized to be executed more efficiently on an in-order core. Essentially, in this example, cold code (low-recurrence) is distributed to native, OOO core 101, while hot code (high-recurrence) is distributed to software-managed, in-order core 102. A hot portion of code may be identified statically, dynamically, or a combination thereof. In the first case, a compiler or user may determine a section of program code is hot code. Here, a hot code identifier instruction(s) may demarcate a section of code as hot, i.e. to be executed on core 202 instead of on core 101. Decode logic in core 201, in one embodiment, is adapted to decode a hot code identifier instruction from the program code, which is to identify the hot portion of the program code. The fetch or decode of such an instruction may trigger translation and\/or execution of the hot section of code on core 202. In this example, the code distribution module 210 includes the decode logic to detect the hot code detection instruction. And module 210 may also include other hardware and\/or software to carry out the translation\/optimization, as well as the execution of the hot code on core 202. Alternatively, the hot-code section may be pre-optimized\/translated for execution on core 202. In another example, code distribution module 210 dynamically (during execution) identifies hot spots\/regions in program code. In one embodiment, hardware included in core 201 and\/or core 202 is utilized to profile execution of the program code on a core, such as core 201. Based on the characteristics of the profile\u2014power and\/or performance metrics associated with execution\u2014a region of the program code may be identified as hot code. Similar to the operation of hardware, monitoring code may be executed on one core, such as core 202, to perform the monitoring\/profiling of program code being executed on the other core, such as core 201. Note that such monitoring code may be code held in storage structures within the cores, within processor 200, or held in a system including processor 200. For example, the monitoring code may be microcode, or other code, held in storage structures of core 201, core 202, or processor 200. And, the monitoring code may be executed by traditional execution units, as well as other firmware or logic on processor 200. As yet another example, a static identification of hot code is made as a hint. But dynamic profiling of the program code execution is able to ignore the static identification of a region of code as hot; this type of static identification is often referred to as a compiler or user hint that dynamic profiling may take into account in determining which core is appropriate for code distribution. Moreover, as is the nature of dynamic profiling, identification of a region of code as hot doesn't restrict that section of code to always being identified as hot. For example, assume program code is being executed on an out-of-order core 201. Monitor code executing on core 202 monitors the performance level of core 201's execution of a section of the program code. Based on the implementation, if the performance on core 201 is determined to be enough lower than it would perform on core 202 and\/or a recurrence pattern of the code section on core 201 is high-enough to be predicted to hide core transition overhead; then the code section is identified as hot. After translation and\/or optimization, a translated version of the code section is executed on core 202. Similar to the monitoring of execution on core 201, the execution of the translated version of code may be monitored on core 202, such as through execution of the performance monitoring code. If the performance is lower on core 202 than on core 201, then the identification of the code section as hot may be dynamically reversed (the section of hot code may be relabeled as cold code). Once a section, spot, or region of codes is identified as hot, code distribution module 210, in one embodiment, optimizes and\/or translates the hot section of code to obtain optimized\/translated hot code. In one embodiment, translation and\/or optimization code, such as binary translation code, is held in storage logic of core 202. As an example, the binary translation code may be part of micro-code held in core 202. The translation\/optimization code, when executed, translates\/optimizes the code section for execution on core 202. In one embodiment, core 201, 202 may recognize the same ISA, or a subset thereof, where translation\/optimization is merely translating\/optimizing code to execute more efficiently on core 202. In another embodiment, core 201, 202 recognize different ISAs, where translation includes translating the code region from one ISA recognizable by core 201 to another ISA recognizable by core 202. Although translation\/optimization is discussed in reference to execution of translation\/optimization code, any known mechanism for translating\/optimizing code, even through exclusive hardware, may be utilized. In one embodiment, upon encountering an identified section of hot code with core 201, the hot code (a translated version thereof) is executed on core 202. Any known trigger for determining when a hot code region is encountered may be utilized. A few high-level examples include: encountering\/referencing an instruction address associated with the code region, fetching\/decoding\/scheduling\/executing an instruction identifying a code section as hot code, fetching\/decoding\/scheduling\/executing an instruction indicating a translated version of hot code is to be executed on another core, an external trigger from a monitor indicating a hot code region has been encountered, etc. As an illustrative example, code distribution module 210 includes a monitor module implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. When the monitor module identifies a hot region of code or translates the hot region to a translated region, the monitor module registers an instruction address associated with the hot region of code. This registration may include association of the instruction address with a location of the translated region of code. Then, when an instruction pointer (program counter) subsequently references the instruction address, its determined from the registered instruction address that a hot region of code has been encountered. Note that any form of detection may be used here, such as a synchronous or asynchronous interrupt style of handling the encounter event. Additionally, hardware, micro-code, and\/or firmware may be capable of directly handling the encounter of a hot code section without interrupt-like handling, i.e. the trigger event is not serviced by a handler. Note that core 101 and 102 may share certain hardware structures, such as a mapping structure, to identify addresses that are registered as hot code. In response to encountering a hot code section on core 201, a translated and\/or optimized version of the hot code section is executed on core 202. Despite how the hot code section is identified and encountered on core 201, any known method for enabling execution of code on another core may be utilized. In one embodiment, a collaboration module is utilized to enable such execution. For example, cores 201, 202 may share certain hardware structures and\/or include communication channels to share information. As one example, cores 101, 102 may share a data cache, so when execution is migrated from core 201 to 202, the data isn't physically moved, but rather is already resident in the shared cache. Similarly, a register file, such as a shadow register file, in one embodiment, is shared between cores 201 and 202, so register states (context) doesn't have to be migrated from one core to another. As an alternative, instead of sharing a register file, a high-speed interconnect may be used to physically migrate context, or a portion thereof, from one core to another. Additionally, with infrequent transfers software may be utilized to perform such transfers. As one example, input values into a hot code-section are transferred from core 201 to core 202 to support execution of the hot-code section on core 202. After execution, output values are then transferred back to core 201. In one embodiment, only identified input\/output values from code sections are transferred, i.e. a partial context switch. Note that such input values may be identified by the user (software\/compiler) and\/or by hardware\/firmware algorithms. Here, direct access hardware may be adapted to read input values from registers, buffers, or other structures in core 201 and write them to core 202. Inversely, the same or different hardware may be utilized to read values from core 202 and write them to core 201. However, where identifying such values becomes too cumbersome, an entire context switch, replication, or sharing may be performed to provide values between cores 201 and 202. Referring next to FIG. 3, an embodiment of a processor for distributing code among cores to achieve maximum performance and power savings is depicted. As above, processor 300 includes two processor cores; each of which is of a different core type. As one example, core 301 is a native, out-of-order (OOO) processor core, while core 302 is a software managed, in-order processor core. Core 301 and 302 may, but are not required to, recognize different ISA types. In fact, core 302 may recognize a subset of core 301's ISA. Or, core 302 may include a separate ISA that partially overlaps core 301's ISA. As described above, a core or processor is often associated with an ISA\u2014a definition of recognized instruction\u2014by decode hardware\/software in the core or processor. In one embodiment, monitor module 305 is to monitor execution of native program code 325 on native, OOO core 301; through this monitoring, module 305 is to identify a hot portion\/region 327 of the program code 325. Monitor module may be comprised of hardware, software, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, monitor module 305 includes hardware to monitor execution. As one example, the hardware includes micro-architectural and\/or architectural hooks, such as retirement pushout tags\/counters to measure retirement pushouts, instruction counters to count numbers of instructions, overall trace execution measurement logic to measure overall execution length and\/or time, recurrence counters to count a number of times a code section was executed, etc., to determine performance\/power metrics during execution of code 325. This type of hardware may be located in any portion of an integrated circuit\/processor, such as within out-of-order core 301, within in-order core 302, and in a non-associated portion of the integrated circuit that is not included within either OOO processor core 301 or the in-order processor core 302. In another embodiment, monitor module 305 includes software, such as monitor code, which when executed, is to monitor execution of program code 325 and to identify a hot region 327 of the program code 325. As an illustrative example, processor 300 includes storage structures, such as Read Only Memory (ROM) structures, programmable logic, etc, to hold code, microcode, or machine code, when executed, causes the monitoring to occur. However, monitor code may be stored in any machine readable medium associated with cores 301, 302. Note that use of the term execution is not only limited to execution by traditional execution units, but instead may refer to execution by other hardware or programmable logic associated with processor 300, such as execution of microcode with firmware. Here, the executed monitor code may perform the same monitoring of recurrence, power, and performance metric that is measurable by hardware. As one example, the monitoring hardware and\/or code tracks\/determines recurrence patterns for code sections of the program code. As a simple example, a data structure associates a reference to a code section (code region 327), such as an instruction address, with a count of the number of times the instruction address\/code section has been executed on core 301. Note that the count may be associated with an absolute count (total count) or a temporal count (a count over an amount of time). In one embodiment, monitor module 305 is adapted to identify\/detect a hot portion 327 of program code 325. Monitor module 305, in one example, is to measure one or more performance metric(s) for the hot portion 327 of the program code 325 during execution on OOO processor core 301. And module 305 is to identify the hot portion 327 of program code 325 in response to the performance metric(s) on the OOO processor core being below a threshold. A non-exhaustive, illustrative list of examples of performance metrics include: instruction retirement pushout, a number of instructions executed, an amount of time to execute a code region, a number of times a code regions is encountered\/executed, an amount of power consumed during execution of a code region, an amount of time spent in different power states during execution of a code region, a thermal density during execution of a code segment, etc. Using one of the examples above, assume OOO core 301 is executing program code 325. Monitor code is being executed to determine a number of times regions of program code 325 are executed on core 301. When that count meets or exceeds a threshold, in one embodiment, monitor module 305 identifies\/determines that region 327 is hot code. If a threshold value of three is used, then when monitor code executing on core 302 detects hot region 327 being re-executed a third time on core 301, region 327 is identified as a hot region of code. The specific example of determining a recurrence pattern may be extrapolated to see that a similar process\u2014count, compare against a threshold, and identify\u2014may be employed for any measured performance metric. Furthermore, determining a performance metric is not limited to simple counts, but may include any known algorithm for determining execution or power savings performance in a core, processor, or computer system. However, identifying hot region 327 within program code 325 is not limited to dynamic performance monitoring. Instead, compiler or static program analysis may be utilized to determine code sections that are likely to be better suited for execution on in-order core 302. For example, assume program analysis reveals that hot region 327 is likely to be re-executed a number of times. In response to this discovery, a compiler or user may insert instructions or demarcations identifying a section of code as hot code. Therefore, when decoders of core 301 encounter such instructions, they recognize that region 327 is hot code that is to be executed on core 302. Note that in some embodiments, users may identify such regions of code based on their knowledge of a program without in-depth program analysis. In one embodiment, in response to identifying region 327 as hot, code 327 is optimized or translated by optimization\/translation module 310 to obtain optimized hot code 304. Similar to operation of monitor module 305, optimization module 310 may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. For example, translation and\/or optimization code may be stored in structures associated with core 302, core 301, or processor 300. To illustrate, binary translation code is stored in firmware associated with core 302. And the binary translation code is executed to translate hot region 327 from a native format for core 301 to a format for core 302. Note that translation may be between ISAs or other formats, while optimization may include any known method for optimizing code for execution, such as known techniques for optimizing code from parallel execution on OOO core 301 to serial execution on core 302, as well as the inverse. However, use of binary translation code in firmware is purely illustrative, as any translation code or optimization code may be held anywhere in a computer system, such as microcode in core 302 or regular program code in a system memory. And, the optimization code may be executed in any manner to translate or optimize hot region 327 to obtain optimized hot code 304. In fact, any known methods or apparatus' for translating or optimizing code for a core, such as the methods and apparatus' known for translating code in current software managed processors may be used. Whether software, firmware, hardware, or a combination is to be used, translation may be performed statically or dynamically. In fact, much like monitoring may be done dynamically during runtime or statically before execution, translation and optimization may similarly be performed. In the example where a compiler or user identifies hot region 327, the optimization and translation may take place at that point (before execution). Here, a hot code identifier instruction may be utilized to both identify hot code region 327 and specify the location of the optimized\/translated code 304. However, no matter if section 327 is identified as hot code before or during execution, the optimization and translation, in some embodiments, takes place dynamically (during runtime). In one embodiment, hot region 327 is optimized\/translated in parallel with other execution. In one example, core 302 begins executing optimization code in parallel with core 301's execution of region 327. Here, monitor module 305 detects execution of hot code region 327 on core 301, so optimization is initiated on core 302. While further instructions from hot region 327 are still being executed on core 301, core 302 begins optimization. As a result, core 302 is essentially optimizing hot code 327 in parallel with execution of hot code 327 on core 301. In another example, core 301 executes other sections of program code 325 or other mutually exclusive code in parallel to core 302's optimization of hot code 327. In another embodiment, optimization of hot region 327 is done serially. For example, core 301 executes hot region 327, and then subsequently core 301 or 302 optimizes hot code region 327. In one embodiment, code 327 is stored at its original memory location and translated on the fly by core 302. However, in most cases, its more efficient to translate\/optimize an entire code section before execution. As a result, after optimization\/translation module 310 optimizes code for a core, such as core 302, the optimized hot code 304 is stored elsewhere. The other location for optimized hot code 304 may be another location in memory, such as a home, system memory location. Yet, since hot code 327 is often associated with frequent execution, its potentially advantageous to hold optimized version 304 closer to core 302. Therefore, in the illustrated embodiment, core 303 includes a code cache 303 to hold the optimized hot code 304. Note that code cache 303 may be a separate cache structure in core 302; a shared cache structure, such as a shared instruction or data cache in core 302; or other general storage structure associated with core 302. Referring back to the discussion of monitor module 305, one embodiment of encountering hot code region 327 includes a program counter referencing an instruction address associated with a code section. As depicted, mapping module 315 is to hold a code region reference, such as the instruction address, associated with optimized hot code reference 317. Essentially, an entry of mapping module 315 associates hot code region 327 with an optimized version thereof (optimized hot code 304). As an illustrative example, reference 316 includes an address, such as the instruction address, associated with hot region 327. In this scenario, when core 301 encounters (a program counter points to) the instruction address held in field 316 of mapping module 315, then monitor module 305 indicates that hot region 327 has been encountered and is to be executed on core 302. Collaboration module 320, which is briefly described above and discussed in more detail below, then facilitates the movement of data and\/or context to core 302 for execution. Determining hot region 327 has been encountered and is to be executed on core 302, in the above example, is only on reference 316. The association of field 317 with field 316 may then be utilized to quickly determine where optimized hot code version 304 of region 327 is located. As a result, field 317 may include any reference to the location of optimized hot code 304. A few simple examples of such a reference include: an address of an entry in code cache 303 holding optimized code 304, an offset from the start of code cache 303 to entry 304 holding optimized hot code, and a physical or linear address associated with entry 304. Mapping module 315 is illustrated in a simple table structure, which may be implemented and\/or maintained in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Yet, any known method for associating one location with another location may be utilized for associating hot code 327 with an optimized version thereof. Although not specifically illustrated, portions of monitor module 305 in combination with mapping module 315 may form a trigger module for indicating optimized hot code 304 is to be executed on core 302, instead of native code 327 on core 301. As an example, when a program counter for core 301 is moved to a next instruction address, trigger hardware checks that address against references stored in mapping hardware table 315. Here, assume the program counter points the instruction address that references code region 327 held in field 316. Then, the trigger hardware, based on the entry in mapping table 315, indicates that an optimized code region 304 for code region 327 exists. As a result, execution of code region 327 on core 301 may be elided, since an optimized version already exists and is to be executed on core 302. In one embodiment, core 301 halts execution (stops or transitions into a low power state) until core 302 completes execution of the optimized code. However, this may not take full advantage of the processing capacity of processor 300. Therefore, in another embodiment, core 301 interleaves execution of another software thread (code other than program code 325), while optimized hot code 304 is executing on core 302. As yet another example, core 301 may execute other portions of program code 325 speculatively, which essentially performs a run-ahead helper thread of execution, or executes other portions of code 325 that don't depend from code region 327 out-of-order. Collaboration module 320, in one embodiment, provides collaboration functionality between cores 301, 302. As the simplest example, collaboration module 320 includes an interconnect between cores 301, 302 to transfer information. Yet, in another embodiment collaboration module includes other hardware, which may be exclusive to individual cores or shared between, to facilitate the aforementioned collaboration. For example, core 302 may share a shadow register file of core 301, such that a full context switch of register state from core 301 to core 302 does not have to be performed when optimized hot code 304 is executed on core 302. Instead, core 302 is able to directly access the shadow register file in that scenario. However, collaboration module is not only limited to shared structures and\/or an interconnect. In fact, collaboration module 320 may include hardware, firmware, software, or a combination thereof to provide direct read and\/or write access to registers, storage structures, and buffers in both cores 301, 302. As a result, collaboration module 320, in one embodiment, is capable of transferring data\/register values needed for execution of optimized hot code from core 301 to core 302. And, it is also capable of transferring results back from core 302 to core 301 to enable subsequent proper execution on core 301. Although monitor module 305 has primarily been discussed in reference to monitoring execution on native core 301, monitor module 305, in one embodiment, is also to monitor execution of optimized code on core 302. As a result, monitor module 305 is capable of comparing performance of code section 327 on core 301 with performance of an optimized version 304 on core 302. Furthermore, when performance on core 302 is lower than performance on core 301, or the performance gain is small on core 302 in comparison to an increase in power consumption, then the decision to identify region 327 as hot code may be reversed. As an example, the entry of mapping module 315 indicating such a decision is de-allocated or invalidated; such that the next time core 301 encounters hot code 327, monitor module 305 does not detect reference 316 and does not indicate an optimized hot code version of region 327 should be executed on core 302. Essentially, the reversal sends the previously identified region 327 back to out-of-order core 301. As a specific illustrative example to further demonstrate this performance comparison, assume code region 327 is identified as hot code based on a high-recurrence pattern and a high-instruction execution count. As a result, code 327 is optimized by binary translation code resident on core 302 to obtain optimized code 304. When optimized code 304 is stored in code cache 303, an entry in mapping table 315 is created to associate code region 327 with optimized version 304. When core 301 next encounters a reference that matches the reference in field 316, then execution of optimized code 304 is triggered on core 302, instead of executing code region 327 on core 301. Note that collaboration module through transfer, sharing, or context switching provides the proper values from core 301 to core 302. During core 302's execution of optimized hot code 304, the same performance metric\u2014instruction execution count\u2014is tracked by monitor module 305. If the instruction execution count is less than code region 327 was executed on core 301, then the status quo of region 327 being identified as hot code continues in the future. However, if the instruction execution count is longer on core 302 or a significant power increase is detected, then the identification of region 327 as hot code may be reversed, as described above. In addition to providing communication between cores 301 and 302, collaboration module 320 may also include other features to manage multiple cores of different types. As a first example, a power manager implements a power algorithm to ensure both core 301 and 302 don't operation at maximum power at the same time. However, this example is purely illustrative. And other power algorithms may allow such maximum operation. As another power consideration, core 302 may reside in a power state below maximum (a low-power state) during monitoring of execution on core 301. For example, when core 301 is associated with mechanisms to perform its own monitoring, then core 302 doesn't need to be fully powered up until there is an optimized version of code to be executed. As a result, power is potentially saved by turning off core 302 until it's needed for execution. Inversely, core 301 may be powered down (put in a power state below maximum, such as an ACPI low power state or sleep state), while core 302 is executing optimized hot code. Dynamically switching execution from core to core involves two challenges: 1) timely and accurately predict the most appropriate core for a given segment of code, and 2) efficiently migrate execution between cores. In one embodiment, program execution on a first core may be identified by runtime software and\/or hardware (e.g. based on analyzed ILP in the code region), and then performance metrics and\/or statistics of the current core may be continuously collected by Monitor Module 305 to predict when the execution of program code should switch to a second core. This approach is highlighted in FIG. 4. Since this approach uses data from a single core to predict the other core's performance, in one embodiment the approach is called a \u201csingle-core-prediction\u201d algorithm. Turning to FIG. 4, an embodiment of a flow diagram for a method 400 of distributing code among a first core of a first type (such as an out-of-order core) and a second core of a second type (such as an in-order core) to achieve maximum performance and power savings is illustrated. Although the flows of FIG. 4 are illustrated in a substantially serial fashion, the flows may be performed in a different order, as well as in parallel. Furthermore, each of the flows may be performed utilizing hardware, firmware, or through execution of program code. Execution of program code on an out-of-order (OOO) processor core in a processor is monitored. Reference to program code, in one embodiment, refers to (1) execution of a compiler program(s), either dynamically or statically, to compile other program code; (2) execution of a main program, such as an operating system, hypervisor, application code, or other software program; (3) execution of other program code, such as libraries, associated with the main program code, (4) execution of other program code, such as helper threads or other tasks, which may not be directly associated with main program; or (5) a combination thereof. A compiler often includes a program or set of programs to translate source text\/code into target text\/code. Usually, compilation of program\/application code with a compiler is done in multiple phases and passes to transform hi-level programming language code into low-level machine or assembly language code. Yet, single pass compilers may still be utilized for simple compilation. A compiler may utilize any known compilation techniques and perform any known compiler operations, such as lexical analysis, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, code transformation, and code optimization. Larger compilers often include multiple phases, but most often these phases are included within two general phases: (1) a front-end, i.e., generally where syntactic processing, semantic processing, and some transformation\/optimization may take place, and (2) a back-end, i.e., generally where analysis, transformations, optimizations, and code generation takes place. Some compilers refer to a middle end, which illustrates the blurring of delineation between a front-end and back end of a compiler. As a result, reference to insertion, association, generation, or other operation of a compiler may take place in any of the aforementioned phases or passes, as well as any other known phases or passes of a compiler. In one embodiment, monitoring execution of program code by monitor module 305 comprises tracking a number of times code segments\/regions within the program code are executed. Code regions may be determined in any known manner of grouping instructions\/code. As an example, each time an instruction address associated with a code section is referenced by a program counter of the OOO core, a recurrence count is incremented. If the recurrence count for the code section exceeds a threshold, in one embodiment, the code section is identified as hot code. Either in conjunction with determining recurrence patterns or separately, monitoring execution of program code may include determining\/tracking a performance metric associated with code sections. As disclosed above, exemplary performance metrics may include: instruction retirement pushout, a number of instructions executed, an amount of time to execute a code region, a number of times a code regions is encountered\/executed, an amount of power consumed during execution of a code region, an amount of time spent in different power states during execution of a code region, and a thermal density during execution of a code segment. Yet, any known metric, or combination of metrics, associated with processor execution may be monitored during execution of the program code. At block 402, program code may be executed on a first core. In an embodiment, the first core may be of a first type, such as a narrow out-of-order core. At block 404, performance of the first core may be monitored as the first core executes the program code. At block 406, statistics on the performance may be collected. In an embodiment, the statistics may include branch miss rate, cache miss rate, etc. In an embodiment, monitoring performance and collecting statistics may be performed by Monitor Module 305. At block 408, the performance of executing the program code on a second core may be predicted based at least in part on the performance and statistics of executing the program code on the first core. In an embodiment, the second code may be of a second type, such as a wide in-order core. Alternatively, the first type may be a wide in-order core and the second type may be a narrow out-of-order core. In an embodiment, the prediction may be implemented as a function called \u201cpredict_performance\u201d At block 410, if the predicted performance of the second core to execute the program code is better than the monitored performance of the first core executing the program code, then the following actions may be performed. At block 412, the second core may be powered up from a low power or \u201csleep\u201d state. During the power up, the first core continues execution of the program. At block 414, execution of the program code may be switched from the first core to the second core. At block 416, the first core may be powered down to a sleep state. If the predicted performance of the second core is not better than the first core, execution of the program code on the first core may continue. In a subsequent iteration of the method, positions of the first core and the second core in the method may be swapped (e.g., so that the second core is executed first, performance of the second core is monitored, statistics about the second core are collected, performance of the first core is predicted, and so on). In an embodiment, blocks 404 through 416 may be performed by Code Distribution Module 210. The function predict_performance (core number, performance_core1, statistics_core1) uses the current core execution performance and statistics, performance_core1 and statistics_core1, to predict the performance of the execution on the second core. If the predicted performance is higher than that on the current core, the execution is switched to the other core. This approach is based on the assumption that it is possible to predict the other core's performance using the current core's performance information. Intuitively, a program execution with excessive cache\/branch misses should perform better on the narrow out-of-order core due to its ability to hide the miss latency by executing the later instructions out-of-order. On the other hand, a program with high instruction level parallelism (ILP) and low cache\/branch misses should run more efficiently on the wide-in-order core due to its high execution bandwidth. In an embodiment, to define the function predict_performance, one may first run n pieces of code, c1, . . . , cn, on both the first core and the second core and collect their respective performance information (p11, p12, . . . , p1n), (p21, p22, . . . , p2n), and statistics (s11, s12, . . . , s1n), (s21, s22, . . . , s2n), on the two cores respectively. Then one may find the best fit function F such that (F(p11,s11), F(p12,s12), . . . , F(p1n,s1n))\u2212(p21, p22, . . . , p2n) and (F(p21,s21), F(p22,s22), . . . , F(p2n,s2n))\u2212(p11, p12, . . . , p1n) is minimized. If the standard error of the best fit is small, one may use F as the function predict_performance. If the standard error is high, however, one may need to find more performance parameters to enhance the prediction accuracy. One advantage of this single-core-prediction approach is that it uses only the current core execution statistics to predict the performance of the other core, without the performance and power overhead of involving the other core in making the decision. However, this approach assumes that the performance of the two cores is closely correlated. In some environments\/configurations, the performance of the two cores may be only loosely correlated and a good fit function may not exist. Therefore it may be desirable to have a more general approach. In another embodiment, a dual-core-prediction process uses the performance information observed on two cores in a short period to predict the core switch. Specifically, a \u201cprediction\u201d may be performed at regular intervals to sample and compare the performance on the two cores to decide whether or not to switch the execution to a different core. Note that each prediction may involve two core switches: the first switch takes place to get the performance information from the other core, and the second switch may happen when the performance on the other core is not as good as that on the first core so the execution should switch back to the first core. The first core switch involves powering up the other core and warming up its micro-architectural state for execution, and the second switch only involves a core power-down. To reduce core switch overhead, the prediction may be separated into two operations: a \u201cprediction for continuation\u201d (Pcont) operation and a \u201cprediction for switch\u201d (Pswit). The Pcont operation compares the performance information collected on the current core with the previous performance information of the two cores to decide whether or not the execution should continue on the current core. If the Pcont operation predicts that the execution should not continue on the current core, the Pswit operation activates the other core to run the other core for a short time period and compare the performance information on the two cores to decide whether or not the execution should be switched to the other core. To prevent Pcont from continuing execution on the same core for too long, the parameter K is introduced to dictate that the Pswit operation cannot be skipped for more than K times in a row. Also, each time a Pswit operation is skipped, the previous performance is inflated by an Inflation Factor so that the next Pcont period will find it harder to skip the Pswit operation. The dual-core prediction process 500 is shown in FIG. 5. In an embodiment, S is the sampling interval (e.g., number of cycles between predictions), M is the sample length (e.g., in number of cycles) to collect performance on each core, PU is a number of cycles for powering up the second core, IPC is the number of instructions per cycle, K is the maximum number of continuations (K being a natural number), N is the number of continuations (initially set to 0), and Prev_IPC is the previous IPC (which may be initially set to MAX_FLOAT). In an embodiment, S, M, PU, K, and the Inflation Factor may be set to appropriate values. At block 502, program code may be executed on the first core for a sampling interval of S cycles. In an embodiment, the first core may be of a first type, such as a narrow out-of-order core. At block 504, power up of the second core may be signaled PU cycles before the end of S+M cycles from the start of program code execution. In an embodiment, the second core may be of a second type, such as a wide in-order core. Alternatively, the first type may be a wide in-order core and the second type may be a narrow out-of-order core. At block 506, the number of instructions per cycle for the first core (IPC1) may be collected for M cycles. In an embodiment, monitoring performance and collecting statistics may be performed by one of Monitor Module 305 or Code Distribution Module 210. Next, prediction for continuing execution on the first core (Pcont) may be performed as follows. At block 508, if the number of continuations N is less than the maximum number of continuations K, and the number of instructions per cycle for the first core IPC1 is greater than a previous number of instructions per cycle (Prev_IPC, initially set to a maximum value), then blocks 510, 512, and 514 may be performed. In this case, a switch from the first core to the second core is not done. At block 510, power down of the second core may be signaled. At block 512, the previous number of instructions per cycle Prev_IPC may be set to Prev_IPC multiplied by the Inflation Factor. Processing continues with continued execution of the program code on the first core. If the number of continuations N is less than or equal to the maximum number of continuations K, or the number of instructions per cycle for the first core IPC1 is less than or equal to than a previous number of instructions per cycle Prev_IPC at block 508, then blocks 516, 518, and 520 may be performed. In this case, a switch from the first core to the second core may be done. Next, prediction for switching execution (Pswit) from the first core to the second core may be performed as follows. At block 516, counter N may be set to 0. At block 518, execution of the program code may be switched from the first core to the second core and the number of instructions per cycle for the second core (IPC2) may be collected. Next, a check is made to verify that the switch was worthwhile. At block 520, if the number of instructions per cycle on the second core (IPC2) is less than the number of instructions per cycle on the first core (IPC1), then execution of the program code may be switched from the second core back to the first core at block 522. Alternatively, if another performance metric is used other than number of instructions per cycle, then if performance on the second core is not better than performance on the first core, then execution of the program code may be switched from the second core back to the first core. Power down of the second core may then be signaled at block 524. However, if at block 520 the number of instructions per cycle on the second core (IPC2) is not less than the number of instructions per cycle on the first core (IPC1), then the switching of cores is worthwhile. Alternatively, if another performance metric is used other than number of instructions per cycle, then if performance on the second core is better than or equal to performance on the first core, then switching of cores is worthwhile. At block 528, power down of the first core may be signaled. In either case, processing continues in one embodiment at block 530 with a setting of the previous number of instructions per cycle (Prev_IPC) to the average of the IPC values (e.g., IPC1+IPC2\/2). Although we use arithmetic mean as the average here, we can also use geometric mean, harmonic mean, and any other means to present the average of the two IPC values. Processing is now performed on the second core with the first core being powered down. In a subsequent iteration of the method, positions of the first core and the second core in the method may be swapped (e.g., so the second core is executed first for S cycle, signal power up of the first core, performance of the second core is monitored for M cycles, statistics about the second core are collected, and so on). In an embodiment, at least blocks 504 through 530 may be performed by Code Distribution Module 210. Core switching involves several overheads: 1) activating the other core which may be in a low power state; 2) transferring x86 register states to the other core; 3) moving frequently accessed data into the other data cache; and 4) warming up instruction cache, branch predictor state, and other states on the other core. The latency to wake up (or power up) the other core depends on the low power state in which the other core is in. In some embodiments, if the core is in the low power C2 state, which consumes .about.30% of regular operating power, it may take .about.5000 cycles to power the core up to normal operating speed (C0 state). If the core is in deeper power-down state (C6), which consumes <10% of operating power, it can take .about.200K cycles to wake up in one embodiment. Although the power-up takes time, it can be done in parallel with the execution on the other core. For example, in an embodiment before the first core enters the Pswit\/Pcont period, the first core (or other module) can send a signal to the second core to initiate power-up. At the end of the first core's prediction period, the second core may be already powered up and can continue execution of the program code. With this early power-up strategy, power-up latency should affect neither the core switch latency nor the performance, although it increases energy consumption. In an embodiment, data and instruction caches may take up to 10K cycles to warm-up, even if the level 2 (L2) cache is shared among the two cores. Also, modern hybrid branch predictors allow the branch predictor to be warmed up fairly quickly. Assume the core power up takes PU cycles and the branch predictor and L1 cache warm-up takes WU cycles. FIG. 6 illustrates the core switching action and overhead. The representations of time in FIG. 6 are merely illustrative and are not meant to convey any actual, specific timing relationships between the various stages. Before the first core 601 enters the Pcont period, the first core signals the second core 602 to power-up 603. After the first core finishes its Pcont operation and finds that a core switch may be needed, program code execution may be switched to the second core 604. At that time, the second core has already been powered up, and starts its warm-up for WU cycles 605. After the warm-up period, the second core runs for a short time (e.g., M cycles) to collect its performance data 606. Let's assume that at that time the second core's performance is better than the first core's performance, so the second core signals the first core to power down (PD) 607, and continues execution on the second core. Near the end of the next Pcont period, the second core signals to the first core to power-up 608. After the second core finishes its Pcont period and finds that the second core should continue execution, the second core signals the first core to power-down 609 and continues execution of the program code on the second core. As a result of coupling a native core with a different co-designed core, the best of power and execution benefits are potentially obtained even within a single application when using dynamic core selection techniques as discussed herein. For example, with an out-of-order core and a software managed, in-order core, code that is not efficient on the software-managed core is migrated to the out-of-order core. And inversely, the code that is not efficient on the out-of-order core is migrated to the software managed core. Through hardware, software, firmware, or a combination therefore parallel execution of native code, hot code detecting, and hot code optimization may be efficiently managed, while individual sections of multiple threads may be efficiently interleaved in a pipelined fashion between the out-of-order and in-order co-designed cores. As a result, maximum performance may be obtained, while achieving better power performance through different power efficiency techniques, such as placing the out-of-order core in a low power state during execution on the in-order core in some implementations. A module as used herein refers to any hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Often module boundaries that are illustrated as separate commonly vary and potentially overlap. For example, a first and a second module may share hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof, while potentially retaining some independent hardware, software, or firmware. In one embodiment, use of the term logic includes hardware, such as transistors, registers, or other hardware, such as programmable logic devices. However, in another embodiment, logic also includes software or code integrated with hardware, such as firmware or micro-code. A value, as used herein, includes any known representation of a number, a state, a logical state, or a binary logical state. Often, the use of logic levels, logic values, or logical values is also referred to as 1's and 0's, which simply represents binary logic states. For example, a 1 refers to a high logic level and 0 refers to a low logic level. In one embodiment, a storage cell, such as a transistor or flash cell, may be capable of holding a single logical value or multiple logical values. However, other representations of values in computer systems have been used. For example the decimal number ten may also be represented as a binary value of 1010 and a hexadecimal letter A. Therefore, a value includes any representation of information capable of being held in a computer system. Moreover, states may be represented by values or portions of values. As an example, a first value, such as a logical one, may represent a default or initial state, while a second value, such as a logical zero, may represent a non-default state. In addition, the terms reset and set, in one embodiment, refer to a default and an updated value or state, respectively. For example, a default value potentially includes a high logical value, i.e. reset, while an updated value potentially includes a low logical value, i.e. set. Note that any combination of values may be utilized to represent any number of states. The embodiments of methods, hardware, software, firmware or code set forth above may be implemented via instructions or code stored on a machine readable medium which are executable by a processing element. A machine-readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (i.e., stores and\/or transmits) information in a form readable by a machine, such as a computer or electronic system. For example, a machine-readable medium includes random-access memory (RAM), such as static RAM (SRAM) or dynamic RAM (DRAM); ROM; magnetic or optical storage medium; flash memory devices; electrical storage devices; optical storage devices; etc. Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention.

Housing 8 may further comprise openings in the side wall to enable a user to see within the apparatus 100. Collar 1 further comprises a circular opening in the center that the tree trunk 22 is inserted into. And collar 1 comprises a hinge mechanism 13 on the front side of apparatus 100 to enable the collar to be rotated 90 degrees upward to a vertical position when the tree is to be discarded. For example, FIG. 3 illustrates a hinge 13 comprising a pin on either side of the collar inset, and a thicker collar surface to facilitate rotating and stabilizing the collar in a vertical position. Wheel with Spurs: Apparatus 100 inner components comprise a lower revolving wheel 7 that the tree trunk rests upon when the rotating cylinder 5 is locked into position via the cylinder guide (see FIG. 3, plate 10 that fits into base's indentation). Wheel 7 further comprises a plurality of vertically oriented spurs 9 to embed into the bottom of the tree trunk so that the trunk does not slip when wheel 7 is rotated. The user places the trunk of tree 22 into the fixed hinged collar 1 and the rotating cylinder 5 of apparatus 100, and lowers it until the tree trunk bottom is resting against the plurality of spurs 9 that point vertically upward from wheel 7. Wheel 7 rotation is also facilitated by the wheel resting upon a centered, conical shaped post 11 that extends downward from the wheel. Rotating Cylinder and Cable Assembly: Apparatus 100 inner components further comprise a rotating cylinder connected to a cable assembly. As illustrated in the cross sectional left side view of FIG. 3, rotating cylinder 5 is joined to three triangular shaped baffles 20, or ledges, on its top edge. Cable 4 (in the cross sectional view) lays on top of baffles 20 and against the outer sidewall of cylinder 5. The cable assembly comprises a tightening mechanism to automatedly turn a plurality of horizontally positioned screws 3 into the tree trunk bark. Each tightening mechanism comprises a hollow cylinder gliding restraint 2 within which a screw 3 slides, and wherein a hole extends from each restraint 2 that is of sufficient width to allow a cable 4 to easily pass through. For example, FIG. 3a provides an illustration of cable 4 in a cross-sectional view within the hole of restraint 2. The cable assembly is also viewed from a top plan view in FIGS. 7 and 8. Cable 4 rests on the triangular shaped baffles 20 while encircling cylinder 5 (projecting out of figures) about 300 degrees in the exemplified embodiment. The length of cable 4 and the diameter of cylinder 5 further determine the length of the circumference of cylinder 5 that cable 4 covers. FIG. 7 illustrates cable 4 passing through the hole (not shown) of each of three gliding restraints 2 when the screws 3 are fully retracted, such as before a tree trunk is inserted into the apparatus 100. The three baffles 20 are aligned with the screws 3 when the screws are fully retracted and not touching the tree trunk. FIG. 8 illustrates each component's position after the wheel 7 and cylinder 5 (projecting out of page and not shown) are rotated 90 degrees clockwise, such as when a tree trunk bottom end is inserted into apparatus 100 and connected with spurs 9. Rotation of wheel 7 and cylinder 5 is forced by the user manually rotating the tree trunk 22 clockwise. This also causes movement of cable 4 clockwise that subsequently pulls the three sets of restraint 2 and screw 3 perpendicularly inward towards a tree trunk (not shown) to affix the trunk vertically within the stand. Baffles 20 likewise rotate 90 degrees clockwise while cable 4 comes to rest against the outer sidewall of rotating cylinder 5 along the cable's entire length. Additionally, when cable 4 moves as the cylinder 5 rotates, each screw 3 moves independently from the other two screws. As a result, a tree trunk with an uneven outer surface is affixed between the three screws in a stable manner where each of the screws 3 may be extended a different length from their restraint 2 because of the trunk's unevenness. The independent movement of screws also enables apparatus 100 to fit a wide range of tree trunk diameters, such as from about 2.5 inches to about 7 inches. Locking Foot Pedal: As illustrated in FIGS. 2, 4, 5, and 11, apparatus 100 further comprises a locking foot pedal 15 for use after the cylinder 5 and wheel 7 are completely rotated. When the user steps on pedal 15, it will rotate to a closed and locked position lying flush with the outer surface of housing 8. The cylinder 5, wheel 7, screws 3 and restraints 2 are no longer able to move, and the tree trunk is locked within the stand apparatus 100. Locking pedal 15 may further comprise: a center hole 14 for watering the tree; an upward curved component, or other structure, to facilitate lifting the pedal with the front tip of a user's shoe; and a hinge connection on the pedal's top surface to pivot the pedal between a locked and unlocked position. Adjustments: The amount of tightening and the tree position is adjustable by manually rotating counter-clockwise the tree trunk 22 before depressing the locking pedal 15. The rotation automatedly retracts the restraints 2 and screws 3 outwardly to loosen the tree. Additionally, before and after the locking pedal 15 is depressed, screws 3 can be manually turned by the user to further stabilize the tree within the stand. Method of Watering Tree Watering Hole: As illustrated in FIGS. 3, 3b, and 4, locking pedal 15 further comprises a center hole 14 that is angled upward, and of sufficient diameter, to tightly fit an adapter 23 that is affixed onto a bottle comprising a threaded spout. Adapter 23 slides down into hole 14 and allows water and other fluid nutrients from bottle 24 (FIG. 3b) to pour into the cylinder 5 until it reaches a desired level for proper plant hydration (see FIG. 3, line 21). Adapter 23's tight fit into hole 14 and onto the bottle spout prevents the fluid and nutrients from leaking onto the floor. Built-In Tarp Embodiment and Method of Disassembling Apparatus 100 may further comprise a built-in tarp 16 residing on a roller 18 within housing 8. As illustrated in FIGS. 3, 9, and 10, tarp 16 is unrolled by pulling on the tarp end(s) 17 hanging from spool 18, that extends out of housing 8 via slot 19. As shown in FIG. 9, once the tarp 16 is unrolled from the housing 8, it is unfolded and laid on the ground while one end is still attached to housing 8 at slot 19. The tree stand apparatus 100 is then disassembled by: unlocking pedal 15 by lifting it at the hinge 13; and then rotating the tree downward to lay on the floor while the cylinder 5 and cable assembly rotate out of housing 8 and into a vertical position (e.g. see FIGS. 10 and 11). Next, the user manually loosens screws 3 and rotates cylinder 5 counter-clockwise to retract restraints 2. The user then pulls tree 22 free from the apparatus 100 by removing cylinder 5, with the cable assembly and collar 1, from the tree trunk. The ends of tarp 16 are then folded over the tree and sealed shut with the adhesive tape end 28 that extends along one or both borders of the tarp. The disposable tarp (e.g. made of recyclable plastic) and tree may then be thrown into the trash without littering the ground with tree needles while transporting the tree.

Semiconductors typically have a threshold temperature above which their performance is severely degraded, thus the internal cooling of electronic equipment has been a parameter of great interest to designers and manufacturers. Some common forms of heat dissipation in early electronics designs were liquid to gas phase change of a fluid in direct contact with the heat-generating device (Camp, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,883,591; April 1959), metal-to-metal contact heat conduction away from the heat-generating components (Deakin, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,917,286; December 1959), a heat sink in direct thermal contact with the mechanical structure of the device (Potter, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,196,317; July 1965), and solid to liquid phase change of a substance in thermal contact with the heat-generating device (Haumesser, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,328,642; June 1967). The most common forms of heat dissipation in early personal computer designs involved direct physical contact between heat-generating integrated circuits and a heat-conducting heat sink mass such as aluminum, and non-turbulent airflow, typically generated by electrical fans, to circulate cool air through a space interior to the computer system housing. In the early large-scale computing systems of the 1940s and 1950s, heat dissipation consisted primarily of ventilation apertures in housings, followed by ambient-air fans and blowers which cooled by forced air convection. Zelina, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,566,958 (1971), describes a means of thermally coupling heat conductors to integrated circuit chips, though without addressing how to transport the heat contained in the heat-conducting material away from the space surrounding the electrical device. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,648,113 (1972) Rathjen describes a means of stacking planar electronic devices, with spacing between the flat planes, and cooling the entire assembly using fluid flow across the flat surfaces; the cooling fluid exits the entire assembly, thereby transporting heat away from the heat-generating electronics. Schuler discloses an electronics system casing with good thermal conduction properties in U.S. Pat. No. 3,699,394 (1972); the case was presumed to be of metallic composition, though possibly sealed or bonded with thermally conductive epoxy. Austin, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,737,728 (1973) discloses a mounting structure for fragile heat-generating devices (e.g. devices used in computer apparatuses), as well as uniformity of heat conduction and good heat dissipation away from the core assembly area. These ideas are combined in U.S. Pat. No. 3,865,183 (1975), in which Roush describes a more comprehensive means of constructing a full computer assembly with good heat dissipation characteristics of the individual circuit boards in the module, with fluid flow for removal of heat energy from the assembly. As demand for ruggedized portable electronic devices increased, engineers began to incorporate shock and vibration damping features into electronic system designs. Damping of vibration and shock forces is particularly important for hard disk drives (magnetic spinning platter disk drives) which are susceptible to externally generated vibrations and shocks that may cause a read head to make physical contact with a spinning surface, thereby rendering unreadable the information contained in that physical portion of the platter surface. Damping of internally generated kinetic forces that result in vibration is important for reliable operation of hard disk drives and collections of hard disk drives that are mounted in the same enclosure. U.S. Pat. No. 4,382,587 (Heinrich, et al, May 1983) disclose a means for vibration damping for an electronic component and system designs. U.S. Pat. No. 6,618,246 (Sullivan et al., September 2003) disclose a design that incorporates thermal conduction and shock resistance in distinctive features for an electronic unit. U.S. Pat. No. 8,050,028 (Merz et al., November 2011) disclose a design that incorporates thermal conduction and shock resistance in distinctive features for a computing device. U.S. Pat.

No. 8,913,390 (Malek et al., December 2014) disclose a design for thermal conduction and shock resistance at the edge surface of a printed circuit board. U.S. Pat. No. 6,151,216 (Vos et al., November 2000) disclose a design that incorporates thermal conduction and shock and vibration resistance in the same feature by using a wire rope connected to both a housing and an enclosed electronic device. U.S. Pat. No. 8,520,390 (Okamoto et al., August 2013) disclose a design that incorporates thermal conduction and vibration damping for an electro-mechanical device using two separate materials with distinctive characteristics. Despite heat dissipation innovations for electronic devices in general, the hard disk drive (magnetic spinning platter disk drive) is a computer component that continues to accomplish low-efficiency heat dissipation primarily by means of air circulation around the exterior of the disk drive unit. Such a hard disk drive unit is a data storage device used for storing and retrieving digital information using rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. Digital information is written to and read from the rotating disks by means of a sensor on a mechanical arm that is literally flown over the surface of the disk. The atmospheric environment inside the disk drive unit is critical to the \u201cfly-height\u201d of the sensor. Therefore, almost all hard disk drive units are designed to allow atmospheric air to enter and leave the unit as necessary to maintain a suitable molecular composition and pressure of gas inside the disk drive unit. Because the hard disk drive units a) must remain open to the atmosphere and b) produce rotational and translational vibration that must be damped for proper operation, disk drive units commonly use air circulation around the exterior of the disk drive unit for heat dissipation. Two major exceptions to the common hard disk drive design exist in the market today\u2014the SSD and the helium filled hard disk drive. The SSD is a \u201csolid-state disk\u201d that is comprised of solid state memory chips and has no moving parts. The helium filled hard disk drive unit is a hermetically sealed unit designed to internally contain a helium environment instead of atmospheric air. The only current example of a helium filled hard disk drive unit is produced by HGST. All disk drive units can benefit greatly from an improved means of heat dissipation that results in improved performance, reliability, and disk drive unit longevity. Optical platter disk drives are subject to many of the same limitations as magnetic spinning platter disk drives. Current solutions for electronic device mounting and enclosures that combine vibration damping with heat dissipation have significant shortcomings. Typically, current solutions for electronic device mounting and enclosures are optimized for only one of a) manufacturing cost, b) thermal transfer, or c) vibration damping. The solutions that are low in manufacturing costs are typically air-cooled and result in marginal cooling and vibration damping performance. The solutions that are optimized for thermal transfer are typically constructed as custom cold-plate designs with tight tolerances and complex cooling piping that result in higher manufacturing costs, higher system maintenance costs, and lower vibration damping. The solutions that are optimized for vibration damping are typically air-cooled and require moderately complex structural elements resulting in marginal cooling performance, larger overall unit sizes, and higher manufacturing costs. The solutions that are optimized for vibration damping and heat dissipation are typically constructed with complex structural elements resulting in larger overall unit sizes, and higher manufacturing costs, and higher system maintenance costs. For example, the heat-conducting wire rope solution of U.S. Pat. No. 6,151,216 requires attachment points for the wire rope on both the exterior casing or chassis and the electronic device itself. A failure of either attachment point, or a fatigue failure of the wire rope itself after prolonged exposure to small-scale vibrations, causes loss of both heat conduction and vibration damping functionality. Thermally conductive plastics and elastomers are newer marketplace innovations that enable excellent thermal conduction, mechanical strength, and vibration damping properties in a single material and are useful for such applications as heat exchangers, heat sinks, enclosures, and electronics substrates and packaging. Two examples of potential commercial applications of thermally conductive plastics are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application US20100012354 A1 (2009), in which Hedin and Miller describe a printed circuit board contains a thermally conductive dielectric layer; and Patent Application WO2013171483 A1 (2012), in which Lee and Laverick disclose a vessel of thermally conductive plastic for freeze-drying. The inventions disclosed herein overcome many of the shortcomings of prior art in relation to the heat dissipation and vibration damping of electronic devices. Thermally conductive plastics and elastomers enable significant design improvements as disclosed herein. In particular, mounting assemblies and enclosures can be constructed using thermally conductive plastics and elastomers with low cost manufacturing techniques that create mounting and enclosure assemblies that are in contact with and interposed between the electronic device to be cooled and the supporting structure for the electronic device. This contact type of assembly transmits heat as much as one hundred times more efficiently than air while at the same time effectively absorbing vibrations and shock that would normally act on the electronic device or be passed on to the supporting structure. This is a significant improvement on current processes, eliminating or greatly reducing the requirement for inefficient air exchange cooling and thereby enabling the installation of electronic devices in a sealed enclosure. These improvements result in lower manufacturing costs as well as electronic device performance improvements that include longer life, higher reliability, and lower maintenance. Further, this is an enabling improvement for the systems in which the devices are installed resulting in higher system density designs, smaller system size, lower manufacturing costs, higher environmental tolerances, lower maintenance costs, more flexibility in installation locations, better control of system heat dissipation, lower operational noise, and much higher physical, electrical, and magnetic system security.","summary":"<SOH> BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <EOH>Various embodiments of a system and method for heat dissipation and vibration damping assembly for electronic devices are disclosed herein.

TECHNICAL FIELD This disclosure relates to a system and method for heat dissipation and vibration damping of electronic devices by installing the electronic devices in a thermally conductive plastic assembly that provides for thermal conduction and vibration damping of an electronic device. BACKGROUND The heat generated by the internal components of electronic devices has long been a significant factor determining the design of microelectronic systems. Semiconductors typically have a threshold temperature above which their performance is severely degraded, thus the internal cooling of electronic equipment has been a parameter of great interest to designers and manufacturers. Some common forms of heat dissipation in early electronics designs were liquid to gas phase change of a fluid in direct contact with the heat-generating device (Camp, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,883,591; April 1959), metal-to-metal contact heat conduction away from the heat-generating components (Deakin, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,917,286; December 1959), a heat sink in direct thermal contact with the mechanical structure of the device (Potter, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,196,317; July 1965), and solid to liquid phase change of a substance in thermal contact with the heat-generating device (Haumesser, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,328,642; June 1967). The most common forms of heat dissipation in early personal computer designs involved direct physical contact between heat-generating integrated circuits and a heat-conducting heat sink mass such as aluminum, and non-turbulent airflow, typically generated by electrical fans, to circulate cool air through a space interior to the computer system housing. In the early large-scale computing systems of the 1940s and 1950s, heat dissipation consisted primarily of ventilation apertures in housings, followed by ambient-air fans and blowers which cooled by forced air convection. Zelina, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,566,958 (1971), describes a means of thermally coupling heat conductors to integrated circuit chips, though without addressing how to transport the heat contained in the heat-conducting material away from the space surrounding the electrical device. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,648,113 (1972) Rathjen describes a means of stacking planar electronic devices, with spacing between the flat planes, and cooling the entire assembly using fluid flow across the flat surfaces; the cooling fluid exits the entire assembly, thereby transporting heat away from the heat-generating electronics. Schuler discloses an electronics system casing with good thermal conduction properties in U.S. Pat. No. 3,699,394 (1972); the case was presumed to be of metallic composition, though possibly sealed or bonded with thermally conductive epoxy. Austin, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,737,728 (1973) discloses a mounting structure for fragile heat-generating devices (e.g. devices used in computer apparatuses), as well as uniformity of heat conduction and good heat dissipation away from the core assembly area. These ideas are combined in U.S. Pat. No. 3,865,183 (1975), in which Roush describes a more comprehensive means of constructing a full computer assembly with good heat dissipation characteristics of the individual circuit boards in the module, with fluid flow for removal of heat energy from the assembly. As demand for ruggedized portable electronic devices increased, engineers began to incorporate shock and vibration damping features into electronic system designs. Damping of vibration and shock forces is particularly important for hard disk drives (magnetic spinning platter disk drives) which are susceptible to externally generated vibrations and shocks that may cause a read head to make physical contact with a spinning surface, thereby rendering unreadable the information contained in that physical portion of the platter surface. Damping of internally generated kinetic forces that result in vibration is important for reliable operation of hard disk drives and collections of hard disk drives that are mounted in the same enclosure. U.S. Pat. No. 4,382,587 (Heinrich, et al, May 1983) disclose a means for vibration damping for an electronic component and system designs. U.S. Pat. No. 6,618,246 (Sullivan et al., September 2003) disclose a design that incorporates thermal conduction and shock resistance in distinctive features for an electronic unit. U.S. Pat.

As referenced herein, the terms \u201cthermally conductive plastic\u201d, \u201cthermally conductive and vibration damping plastic\u201d, \u201cthermally conductive elastomer\u201d, \u201cthermally conductive viscoelastic\u201d, and \u201cthermally conductive polymers\u201d are used interchangeably. As referenced herein, vibration is defined as movement of an electronic device in any X, Y, Z plane that is a result of a rotational, translational, oscillating, vibratory, shock, or other kinetic forces. As referenced herein, vibrational forces are forces to which an electronic device is subject as a result of vibration. As referenced herein, vibration damping is the attempt to minimize or eliminate vibrational forces that act on an electronic device and\/or the transmission of said vibrational forces to associated or adjacent objects such as structures, enclosures, or other devices. FIG. 1 shows a conceptual view of a heat dissipation and a vibration damping assembly 150 for at least one electronic device 104, said assembly 150 formed by one or more surfaces that are comprised of thermally conductive plastic (\u201cPlastic Device Mounting Assembly\u201d) that combine to partially or completely enclose or surround said at least one electronic device 104 as a physical and thermal intermediary between said at least one electronic device 104 and supporting structures associated with said at least electronic device 104. The Plastic Device Mounting Assembly 101, also known as a \u201cthermally conductive and vibration damping plastic structure\u201d, is comprised of thermally conducting plastic configured as one or more associated components. The electronic device 104 is any type of heat-generating electronic device including a circuit board, motherboard, computing unit, hard disk drive (magnetic spinning platter disk drive), optical disk drive (optical spinning platter disk drive), solid state drive, electronic component, or electronic assembly.

A supporting structure may be constructed of any thermally conductive material with suitable structural properties. A supporting structure may be comprised of one or more components such that a reference herein to \u201csupporting structures\u201d has the same meaning as \u201csupporting structure\u201d. One embodiment of a supporting structure creates a compression interface between the supporting structure, Plastic Device Mounting Assembly 101, and associated electronic device 104. In another embodiment, the supporting structure, Plastic Device Mounting Assembly 101, and associated electronic device 104 are attached together by mechanical or chemical means that include screws, bolts, pins, clamps, slides, sockets, brackets, rivets, adhesives, locking\/clipping structures, connection fingers, adhesives, thermal pastes, thermal pads, and thermal epoxies. However, the specific design and configuration of a supporting structure is dependent on a) each specific electronic device 104 and associated Plastic Device Mounting Assembly 101, and b) the overall system into which said electronic device 104 and associated Plastic Device Mounting Assembly 101 is disposed. Embodiments of supporting structures are disclosed in FIGS. 4, 5.
